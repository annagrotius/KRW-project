To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of AMD or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce low-level inflammation. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities as well as increased total bile acid concentrations in serum and midzonal hepatocellular necrosis were observed only in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats. The time interval between AMD and LPS administration was critical: AMD injected 16 h before LPS led to liver injury, whereas AMD injected 2–12 h before LPS failed to cause this response. The increase in ALT activity in AMD/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with AMD as well as LPS. The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of AMD were not affected by LPS coexposure. Serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was significantly increased by LPS and was slightly prolonged by AMD. In Hepac1c7 cells, addition of TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and its primary metabolite, mono-N-desethylamiodarone. In vivo inhibition of TNF signaling by etanercept attenuated the AMD/LPS-induced liver injury in rats. In summary, AMD treatment during modest inflammation induced severe hepatotoxicity in rats, and TNF contributed to the induction of liver injury in this animal model of idiosyncratic AMD-induced liver injury.",One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity.,"['One_hypothesis', 'the_etiology', 'idiosyncratic_adverse_drug_reactions', 'stress', 'results', 'decreased_threshold', 'drug_toxicity']","['One hypothesis', 'the etiology', 'idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions', 'stress', 'results', 'decreased threshold', 'drug toxicity']",One hypothesis,the etiology,idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions,stress,results,decreased threshold,drug toxicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015–2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses.

This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of cross-protective antibodies acquired by older individuals during previous exposures to H1N1 viruses. However, this hypothesis could not be empirically tested. To address this question, we compared viral replication and the development of the immune response in naïve young adult and aged female rhesus macaques infected with A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (CA04) virus. We show higher viral loads in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal and ocular swabs in aged animals, suggesting increased viral replication in both the lower and upper respiratory tracts. T cell proliferation was higher in the BAL fluid but delayed and reduced in peripheral blood in aged animals. This delay in proliferation correlated with a reduced frequency of effector CD4 T cells in old animals. Aged animals also mobilized inflammatory cytokines to higher levels in the BAL fluid. Finally, we compared changes in gene expression using microarray analysis of BAL fluid samples. Our analyses revealed that the largest difference in host response between aged and young adult animals was detected at day 4 postinfection, with a significantly higher induction of genes associated with inflammation and the innate immune response in aged animals. Overall, our data suggest that, in the absence of preexisting antibodies, CA04 infection in aged macaques is associated with changes in innate and adaptive immune responses that were shown to correlate with increased disease severity in other respiratory disease models.","However, this hypothesis could not be empirically tested.",[],[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spread—linear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms.

Trophoblasts produce numerous immunomodulators that play a role in placental development and pregnancy maintenance. We hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise pregnancy. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the expression of representative pro-(TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, and GM-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); CD134, a secondary co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells (FIV primary receptor); the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (FIV co-receptor); SDF-1α, the chemokine ligand to CXCR4; and FIV gag in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. METHODS: We used an anti-cytokeratin antibody in immunohistochemistry to identify trophoblasts selectively, collected these cells using laser capture microdissection, and extracted total RNA from the captured cell populations. Real time, reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify gene expression. RESULTS: We detected IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and CXCR4 in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. Expression of cytokines increased from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. A clear, pro-inflammatory microenvironment was not evident in trophoblasts from FIV-infected queens at either stage of pregnancy. Reproductive failure was accompanied by down-regulation of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. CD134 was not detected in trophoblasts, and FIV gag was detected in only one of ten trophoblast specimens collected from FIV-infected queens. CONCLUSION: Feline trophoblasts express an array of pro-and anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increases from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. Non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. The detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare, suggesting that the high rate of reproductive failure in FIV-infected queens was not a direct result of viral replication in trophoblasts.

Frameshifting efficiencies varied in yeast, but not in E. coli, depending on the specific conformation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot.

As a first line of defense against respiratory infections, innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), play an important role. Upon infection with RSV, multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize RSV-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount innate immune responses. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) have been identified as important innate receptors to mount type I IFNs during RSV infection. However, type I IFN levels remain surprisingly low during RSV infection despite strong viral replication. The poor induction of type I IFNs can be attributed to the cooperative activity of 2 unique, nonstructural (NS) proteins of RSV, i.e., NS1 and NS2. These viral proteins have been shown to suppress both the production and signaling of type I and III IFNs by counteracting a plethora of key host innate signaling proteins. Moreover, increasing numbers of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are being identified as targets of the NS proteins in recent years, highlighting an underexplored protein family in the identification of NS target proteins. To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NS1 was resolved recently and, remarkably, identified NS1 as a structural paralogue of the RSV matrix protein. Unfortunately, no structural data on NS2 have been published so far. In this review, we briefly describe the PRRs that mount innate immune responses upon RSV infection and provide an overview of the various effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, we discuss the ubiquitination effector functions of NS1 and NS2, which are in line with the hypothesis that the NSD shares features with the canonical 26S proteasome.","To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2.","['the_diverse_effector_functions', 'NS1', 'NS2', 'Goswami', 'colleagues', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_NS_degradasome_(NSD)_complex', 'a_multiprotein_complex', 'at_least,_NS1', 'NS2']","['the diverse effector functions', 'NS1', 'NS2', 'Goswami', 'colleagues', 'the hypothesis', 'the NS degradasome (NSD) complex', 'a multiprotein complex', 'at least, NS1', 'NS2']",the diverse effector functions,NS1,NS2,Goswami,colleagues,the hypothesis,the NS degradasome (NSD) complex,a multiprotein complex,"at least, NS1",NS2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This network is thought to accommodate the viral replication machinery and protect it from innate immune detection. We hypothesized that the innate immune response has tools to counteract the formation of these virus-induced replication organelles in order to inhibit virus replication. Here we have investigated the effect of type I interferon (IFN) treatment on the formation of arterivirus-induced membrane structures. Our approach involved ectopic expression of arterivirus nonstructural proteins nsp2 and nsp3, which induce DMV formation in the absence of other viral triggers of the interferon response, such as replicating viral RNA. Thus, this setup can be used to identify immune effectors that specifically target the (formation of) virus-induced membrane structures. Using large-scale electron microscopy mosaic maps, we found that IFN-β treatment significantly reduced the formation of the membrane structures. Strikingly, we also observed abundant stretches of double-membrane sheets (a proposed intermediate of DMV formation) in IFN-β-treated samples, suggesting the disruption of DMV biogenesis. Three interferon-stimulated gene products, two of which have been reported to target the hepatitis C virus replication structures, were tested for their possible involvement, but none of them affected membrane structure formation.

Similar to other class I viral fusion glycoproteins, the F protein has two heptad repeat regions (HRA and HRB) that are important in membrane fusion and can be targeted by antiviral inhibitors. Upon activation of the F protein, HRA refolds from a spring-loaded, crumpled structure into a coiled coil that inserts a hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target membrane and binds to the HRB helices to form a fusogenic hairpin. To investigate how F protein conformational changes are regulated, we mutated in the Sendai virus F protein a highly conserved 10-residue sequence in HRA that undergoes major structural changes during protein refolding. Nine of the 15 mutations studied caused significant defects in F protein expression, processing, and fusogenicity. Conversely, the remaining six mutations enhanced the fusogenicity of the F protein, most likely by helping spring the HRA coil. Two of the residues that were neither located at “a” or “d” positions in the heptad repeat nor conserved among the paramyxoviruses were key regulators of the folding and fusion activity of the F protein, showing that residues not expected to be important in coiled-coil formation may play important roles in regulating membrane fusion.

Reflecting their importance for host defense, pathogens encode various countermeasures to evade or inhibit these immune effectors. PRRs directly engaged by pathogen inhibitors often evolve under recurrent bouts of positive selection that have been described as molecular ‘arms races.’ Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) was recently identified as a key PRR. Upon binding cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various viruses, cGAS generates the small nucleotide secondary messenger cGAMP to signal activation of innate defenses. Here we report an evolutionary history of cGAS with recurrent positive selection in the primate lineage. Recent studies indicate a high degree of structural similarity between cGAS and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), a PRR that detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), despite low sequence identity between the respective genes. We present comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS1 primate sequences and observe positive selection at nucleic acid binding interfaces and distributed throughout both genes. Our data revealed homologous regions with strong signatures of positive selection, suggesting common mechanisms employed by unknown pathogen encoded inhibitors and similar modes of evasion from antagonism. Our analysis of cGAS diversification also identified alternately spliced forms missing multiple sites under positive selection. Further analysis of selection on the OAS family in primates, which comprises OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL, suggests a hypothesis where gene duplications and domain fusion events result in paralogs that provide another means of escaping pathogen inhibitors.

Previous studies have shown significant variation in the incidence of viral, bacterial and mixed infections, with conflicting risk associations for mortality. We aimed to determine the risk association of microbial aetiologies with hospital mortality in severe CAP, utilising a diagnostic strategy incorporating molecular testing. Our primary hypothesis was that respiratory viruses were important causative pathogens in severe CAP and was associated with increased mortality when present with bacterial pathogens in mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2014 to July 2015 was conducted in a tertiary hospital medical intensive care unit in eastern Singapore, which has a tropical climate. All patients diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia were included. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were in the study. Microbial pathogens were identified in 84 (71.8%) patients. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections occurred in 18 (15.4%) of patients. Isolated viral infections were present in 32 patients (27.4%); isolated bacterial infections were detected in 34 patients (29.1%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (13.7%) patients. The most common bacteria isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae and the most common virus isolated was Influenza A. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that serum procalcitonin, APACHE II severity score and mixed viral-bacterial infection were associated with increased risk of hospital mortality. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% CI 1.30–151.05, p = 0.03) for hospital mortality.

Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to naïve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. METHODS: A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four naïve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two naïve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. RESULTS: The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a study of children <24 months old presenting to the emergency department with bronchiolitis. Demographic, clinical information, nasal-wash (NW) and serum specimens were obtained. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7 activity and a panel of cytokines and chemokines. Total LDH activity was tested in NW samples and sera. RESULTS: Of 101 enrolled children (median age, 5.6 months), 98 had NW specimens available. A viral etiology was found in 82 patients (83.6%), with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (66%) and rhinovirus (19%) being the most common viruses detected. Concentrations of LDH in NW specimens were independent from those in sera, and were higher in children with RSV infection or with dual infection. Significant correlations were found between NW LDH and NW cytokines/chemokines. Similarly, NW LDH correlated with NW-caspase 3/7 activity (r=0.75; P<.001). In a multivariate analysis, NW LDH concentration in the upper quartile was significantly associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization (odds ratio: 0.19; 95% confidence interval: 0.05–0.68; P=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: NW LDH levels in young children with bronchiolitis varied according to viral etiology and disease severity. Values in the upper quartile were associated with ~80% risk reduction in hospitalization, likely reflecting a robust antiviral response.

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus.

Mutant viruses isolated from infected glial cultures 16 to 18 weeks postinfection replicate with kinetics similar to those of wild-type virus but produce small plaques on fibroblasts and cause only minimal levels of cell-to-cell fusion under conditions in which wild type causes nearly complete cell fusion. However, since extensive fusion is present in mutant-infected cells at late times postinfection, the defect is actually a delay in kinetics rather than an absolute block in activity. Addition of trypsin to mutant-infected fibroblast cultures enhanced cell fusion a small (two- to fivefold) but significant degree, indicating that the defect could be due to a lack of cleavage of the viral spike (fusion) protein. Sequencing of portions of the spike genes of six fusion-defective mutants revealed that all contained the same single nucleotide mutation resulting in a substitution of aspartic acid for histidine in the spike cleavage signal. Mutant virions contained only the 180-kDa form of spike protein, suggesting that this mutation prevented the normal proteolytic cleavage of the 180-kDa protein into the 90-kDa subunits. Examination of revertants of the mutants supports this hypothesis. Acquisition of fusion competence correlates with the replacement of the negatively charged aspartic acid with either the wild-type histidine or a nonpolar amino acid and the restoration of spike protein cleavage. These data confirm and extend previous reports concluding cleavage of S is required for efficient cell-cell fusion by mouse hepatitis virus but not for virus-cell fusion (infectivity).",Examination of revertants of the mutants supports this hypothesis.,"['Examination', 'revertants', 'the_mutants']","['Examination', 'revertants', 'the mutants']",Examination,revertants,the mutants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We addressed the hypothesis that antigenic drift is involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SSPE by analyzing antigenic alterations in the MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein (MeV-H) found in patients with SSPE in relation to major circulating MeV genotypes. To this aim, we obtained cDNA for the MeV-H gene from tissue taken at brain autopsy from 3 deceased persons with SSPE who had short (3–4 months, SMa79), average (3.5 years, SMa84), and long (18 years, SMa94) disease courses. Recombinant MeVs with a substituted MeV-H gene were generated by a reverse genetic system. Virus neutralization assays with a panel of anti-MeV-H murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or vaccine-immunized mouse anti-MeV-H polyclonal sera were performed to determine the antigenic relatedness. Functional and receptor-binding analysis of the SSPE MeV-H showed activity in a SLAM/nectin-4–dependent manner. Similar to our panel of wild-type viruses, our SSPE viruses showed an altered antigenic profile. Genotypes A, G3, and F (SSPE case SMa79) were the exception, with an intact antigenic structure. Genotypes D7 and F (SSPE SMa79) showed enhanced neutralization by mAbs targeting antigenic site IIa. Genotypes H1 and the recently reported D4.2 were the most antigenically altered genotypes. Epitope mapping of neutralizing mAbs BH015 and BH130 reveal a new antigenic site on MeV-H, which we designated Φ for its intermediate position between previously defined antigenic sites Ia and Ib. We conclude that SSPE-causing viruses show similar antigenic properties to currently circulating MeV genotypes.

This initial attachment is of a multivalent nature, i.e., it requires the establishment of multiple bonds between amino acids of viral glycoproteins and sulfated saccharides on the GAG chain. To gain understanding of how this binding process is modulated, we performed binding kinetics and mobility studies using end-grafted GAG chains that mimic the end attachment of these chains to proteoglycans. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to probe binding and release, as well as the diffusion of single HSV-1 particles. To verify the hypothesis that the degree of sulfation, but also the arrangement of sulfate groups along the GAG chain, plays a key role in HSV binding, we tested two native GAGs (chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) and compared our results to chemically sulfated hyaluronan. HSV-1 recognized all sulfated GAGs, but not the nonsulfated hyaluronan, indicating that binding is specific to the presence of sulfate groups. Furthermore we observed that a notable fraction of GAG-bound virions exhibit lateral mobility, although the multivalent binding to the immobilized GAG brushes ensures firm virus attachment to the interface. Diffusion was faster on the two native GAGs, one of which, chondroitin sulfate, was also characterized by the highest association rate per GAG chain. This highlights the complexity of multivalent virus-GAG interactions and suggests that the spatial arrangement of sulfates along native GAG chains may play a role in modulating the characteristics of the HSV-GAG interaction. Altogether, these results, obtained with a minimal and well-controlled model of the cell membrane, provide, to our knowledge, new insights into the dynamics of the HSV-GAG interaction.","To verify the hypothesis that the degree of sulfation, but also the arrangement of sulfate groups along the GAG chain, plays a key role in HSV binding, we tested two native GAGs (chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) and compared our results to chemically sulfated hyaluronan.","['the_hypothesis', 'the_degree', 'sulfation', 'sulfate_groups', 'the_GAG_chain', 'HSV_binding', 'two_native_GAGs', 'chondroitin_sulfate', 'heparan', 'sulfate', 'our_results', 'hyaluronan']","['the hypothesis', 'the degree', 'sulfation', 'sulfate groups', 'the GAG chain', 'HSV binding', 'two native GAGs', 'chondroitin sulfate', 'heparan', 'sulfate', 'our results', 'hyaluronan']",the hypothesis,the degree,sulfation,sulfate groups,the GAG chain,HSV binding,two native GAGs,chondroitin sulfate,heparan,sulfate,our results,hyaluronan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.",The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG):,"['The_present_hypothesis', 'an_infectious_agent', 'sanctuary', 'the_dorsal_root', 'and cranial_sensory_ganglia', 'DRG']","['The present hypothesis', 'an infectious agent', 'sanctuary', 'the dorsal root', 'and cranial sensory ganglia', 'DRG']",The present hypothesis,an infectious agent,sanctuary,the dorsal root,and cranial sensory ganglia,DRG,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tested this hypothesis using Stat1(–/–) mice, which lack the ability to mount Th1 immune responses. Infection of Stat1(–/–) mice with rhesus rotavirus type A (RRV) on postnatal day 1 induced a prominent Th2 response, duct epithelial injury and obstruction within 7 days, and atresia shortly thereafter. A high degree of phosphorylation of the Th2 transcription factor Stat6 was observed; however, concurrent inactivation of Stat1 and Stat6 in mice did not prevent BA after RRV infection. In contrast, depletion of macrophages or combined loss of Il13 and Stat1 reduced tissue infiltration by lymphocytes and myeloid cells, maintained epithelial integrity, and prevented duct obstruction. In concordance with our mouse model, humans at the time of BA diagnosis exhibited differential hepatic expression of Th2 genes and serum Th2 cytokines. These findings demonstrate compatibility between Th2 commitment and the pathogenesis of BA, and suggest that patient subgrouping in future clinical trials should account for differences in Th2 status.","T cells, we hypothesized that Th1-independent mechanisms can also activate effector cells and induce BA.","['T', 'cells', 'Th1-independent_mechanisms', 'effector_cells', 'BA']","['T', 'cells', 'Th1-independent mechanisms', 'effector cells', 'BA']",T,cells,Th1-independent mechanisms,effector cells,BA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rats (n=6 per group) were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. At the early phase (i.e., 0–6 h after reperfusion), chloroquine treatment ameliorated liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines and fewer histopathologic changes. In contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury at the late phase of reperfusion (i.e., 24–48 h after reperfusion). The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine appeared to involve its ability to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1 release and inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver injury via inhibition of autophagy and induction of hepatic apoptosis at the late phase.

The responses of MNV and VLP to humidity were somewhat similar, with 10 and 100% RH exhibiting a strong conserving effect for both models, whereas 50% RH was detrimental for MNV infectivity and VLP binding capacity. The data analysis suggested that absolute humidity (AH) rather than RH is the critical factor for keeping NoV infectious, with an AH below 0.007 kg water/kg air being favorable to NoV survival. Retrospective surveys of the meteorological data in Paris for the last 14 years showed that AH average values have almost always been below 0.007 kg water/kg air during the winter (i.e., 0.0046 ± 0.0014 kg water/kg air), and this finding supports the fact that low AH provides an ideal condition for NoV persistence and transmission during cold months.",We hypothesized that humidity is linked to NoV seasonality.,"['humidity', 'NoV_seasonality']","['humidity', 'NoV seasonality']",humidity,NoV seasonality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples.

The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors.","['The_model', 'disease_emergence', 'genetic,_physical_environmental,_ecological,_and_social_factors']","['The model', 'disease emergence', 'genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors']",The model,disease emergence,"genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In asthma, injury to epithelial cells can occur during bronchoconstriction, which may exacerbate airway hyperreactivity. To investigate the role of epithelial cell rupture in airway constriction, laser ablation was used to precisely rupture individual airway epithelial cells of small airways (<300-μm diameter) in rat lung slices (∼250-μm thick). Laser ablation of single epithelial cells using a femtosecond laser reproducibly induced airway contraction to ∼70% of the original cross-sectional area within several seconds, and the contraction lasted for up to 40 s. The airway constriction could be mimicked by mechanical rupture of a single epithelial cell using a sharp glass micropipette but not with a blunt glass pipette. These results suggest that soluble mediators released from the wounded epithelial cell induce global airway contraction. To confirm this hypothesis, the lysate of primary human small airway epithelial cells stimulated a similar airway contraction. Laser ablation of single epithelial cells triggered a single instantaneous Ca(2+) wave in the epithelium, and multiple Ca(2+) waves in smooth muscle cells, which were delayed by several seconds. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or decreasing intracellular Ca(2+) both blocked laser-induced airway contraction.

All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 – 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 – 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001) and platelet (P ≤ 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P ≤ 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO.

Related retroviruses have been found in Southeast Asian mice although the sequence similarity was limited. Viruses with a higher sequence homology were isolated from Melomys burtoni, the Australian and Indonesian grassland melomys. However, only the habitats of the koalas and the grassland melomys in Australia are overlapping, indicating that the melomys virus may not be the precursor of the GaLV. Viruses closely related to GaLV/KoRV were also detected in bats. Therefore, given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in Thailand and the koalas in Australia are far away, and that bats are able to fly over long distances, the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration.

Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain.

Growing evidence also implicates the RAS in the control of energy balance, supporting the concept that the RAS may be mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity hypertension.

This feature has previously relegated HRVs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections. HRVs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential, infection-associated healthcare expenditure and relatively unmoderated elicitation of an antiviral state. Objectives To test the hypothesis that respiratory viruses are proportionately more or less likely to co-occur, particularly the HRVs. Study design Retrospective PCR-based analyses of 1247 specimens for 17 viruses, including HRV strains, identified 131 specimens containing two or more targets. We investigated the proportions of co-detections and compared the proportion of upper vs. lower respiratory tract presentations in the HRV positive group. Both univariate contingency table and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify trends of association among the viruses present in co-detections. Results Many of the co-detections occurred in patterns. In particular, HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detecting human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and the polyomaviruses KIPyV and WUPyV (p ≤0.05). No single HRV species nor cluster of particular strains predominated. Conclusions HRVs were proportionately under-represented among viral co-detections.

Globally, bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. Compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. Our study tests the hypothesis that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, improve the clinical outcomes of Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We are conducting a dual centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in northern Australia. Indigenous infants (aged ≤ 24-months, expected number = 200) admitted to one of two regional hospitals (Darwin, Northern Territory and Townsville, Queensland) with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation concealed) to either azithromycin (30 mg/kg/dose) or placebo administered once weekly for three doses. Clinical data are recorded twice daily and nasopharyngeal swab are collected at enrolment and at the time of discharge from hospital. Primary outcomes are 'length of oxygen requirement' and 'duration of stay,' the latter based upon being judged as 'ready for respiratory discharge'. The main secondary outcome is readmission for a respiratory illness within 6-months of leaving hospital. Descriptive virological and bacteriological (including development of antibiotic resistance) data from nasopharyngeal samples will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Two published studies, both involving different patient populations and settings, as well as different macrolide antibiotics and treatment duration, have produced conflicting results. Our randomised, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis is designed to determine whether it can reduce short-term (and potentially long-term) morbidity from respiratory illness in Australian Indigenous infants who are at high risk of developing chronic respiratory illness. If azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the morbidly of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis, the intervention would lead to improved short term (and possibly long term) health benefits.

The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.",Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis.,"['Three_lines', 'evidence', 'support', 'the_hypothesis']","['Three lines', 'evidence', 'support', 'the hypothesis']",Three lines,evidence,support,the hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one- or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.","Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds.","['Genomic_and_phylogenetic_analysis', 'MRV-ZJ2013', 'reassortments', 'mink', 'bat', 'pig_MRVs', 'the_hypothesis', 'transmission', 'pig_herds']","['Genomic and phylogenetic analysis', 'MRV-ZJ2013', 'reassortments', 'mink', 'bat', 'pig MRVs', 'the hypothesis', 'transmission', 'pig herds']",Genomic and phylogenetic analysis,MRV-ZJ2013,reassortments,mink,bat,pig MRVs,the hypothesis,transmission,pig herds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1β (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-β (IFN-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J.

No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules. The leader was shown to be a necessary part of the cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication, however, since removal of terminal bases that destroyed a predicted intraleader stem-loop also destroyed replicating ability. Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication.

Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarray to profile essentially all human genes, we observed that 426 probe signals were changed by >2.9-fold in the SPB placentas, compared with the spontaneous term birth (STB) placentas. Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (≤32.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056). CONCLUSION: We have identified 36 SPB-associated RNA transcripts, which are possibly detectable in maternal plasma. We have illustrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA was more frequently detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples collected from women resulting in SPB than the gestational-age matched controls.","We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls.","['SPB', 'aberrant_placental_RNA_expression', 'such_RNA_transcripts', 'predelivery_maternal_plasma_samples', 'gestational_age-matched_controls']","['SPB', 'aberrant placental RNA expression', 'such RNA transcripts', 'predelivery maternal plasma samples', 'gestational age-matched controls']",SPB,aberrant placental RNA expression,such RNA transcripts,predelivery maternal plasma samples,gestational age-matched controls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.","We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order.","['a_quantitative_analysis', 'the_hypothesis', 'bats', 'their_propensity', 'zoonotic_viruses', 'a_comparison', 'rodents']","['a quantitative analysis', 'the hypothesis', 'bats', 'their propensity', 'zoonotic viruses', 'a comparison', 'rodents']",a quantitative analysis,the hypothesis,bats,their propensity,zoonotic viruses,a comparison,rodents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the immunopathogenesis and viral genetic determinants responsible for the induction of immunodeficiency disease in vivo, we have generated chimeras between the two major viral genomes in the original virus isolate, designated common form clone 61E and major variant clone 61C, which were molecularly cloned directly from DNA of the same animal and tissue. Each of three 61E/C chimeras, containing at minimum a 34-amino-acid segment (including a 6-amino-acid insertion and one amino acid substitution) near the C terminus of the 61C surface glycoprotein (gp70), induced fatal immunodeficiency disease in all (12 of 12) infected animals over a course of 33 +/- 10 weeks. By contrast, animals infected with virus 61E, although persistently antigenemic, remained asymptomatic throughout a 48-week observation period. Beginning 14 weeks after infection, a significant decrease (8 to 10%) in the percent of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes developed in the 61E/C chimera-infected cats, compared with either 61E-infected or control animals. At this time, no significant changes were seen in CD8 cells, B cells, or mitogen-induced blastogenesis. Prior to this initial decline in CD4 cells, the ability of all antigenemic 61E/C-infected cats to generate a primary antibody response to the T-cell-dependent antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin was markedly impaired, whereas all 61E-infected cats, one 61E/C-infected but nonviremic cat, and all uninfected control cats produced normal antibody responses. The results reported here demonstrate that a major determinant of in vivo immunodeficiency induction by FeLV-FAIDS is contained within a 34-amino-acid C-terminal segment of its surface glycoprotein and that this gp70 alteration determines the early and persistent deficits in CD4+ T lymphocytes and T-cell-dependent antibody responses.

Hygienic practices that have reduced exposure of the immune system to such agents include the use of modern toiletry, disposable diapers and clothes dryers. Historically, the anal region was cleansed following defecation with natural materials that would have brought antigens and infectious agents from the environment into frequent contact with the perianal skin and anal mucosa. This practice was a crude form of transcutaneous and mucosal vaccination, whereby antigenic agents that are topically applied to skin or mucosal surfaces, penetrate into the tissues and stimulate immune responses that can extend to the respiratory tract. Furthermore, until the 1960s, diapers and other cloth items were often dried outdoors where they would have collected environmental antigens that, when applied to the body, could have made contact with the immune system in the skin. Herein, it is hypothesized that prevention of allergic rhinitis and possibly other disorders involving the immune system could be achieved by the daily application of preparations composed of environmental antigens and infectious agents to the anal mucosa and adjacent skin. In support of the proposal, immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis currently involves administration of specific allergens to subcutaneous tissue or to the sublingual mucosa. It is considered that superior protection could be achieved by applying the allergens to the anal region where they would target the immune system in both mucosal tissue and adjacent skin. It is also hypothesized that respiratory viruses applied to the anal region would infect tissues at that site and induce immune responses that would protect the respiratory tract against the common cold and influenza. This approach is supported by evidence that orally administered adenovirus vaccine can induce an infection in the intestinal mucosa that stimulates immunity to protect the respiratory tract. Although other respiratory viruses are unlikely to survive passage through the intestinal tract, rhinovirus has on rare occasion been detected in stool specimens, suggesting the possibility of an infection at the terminal end of the digestive tract. Respiratory syncytial viruses and influenza viruses are amenable to modification by reverse genetics and other techniques and it is expected that natural or modified viruses applied to the anal region could serve to immunize the respiratory tract.","Herein, it is hypothesized that prevention of allergic rhinitis and possibly other disorders involving the immune system could be achieved by the daily application of preparations composed of environmental antigens and infectious agents to the anal mucosa and adjacent skin.","['Herein', 'that prevention', 'allergic_rhinitis', 'possibly_other_disorders', 'the_immune_system', 'the_daily_application', 'preparations', 'environmental_antigens', 'adjacent_skin']","['Herein', 'that prevention', 'allergic rhinitis', 'possibly other disorders', 'the immune system', 'the daily application', 'preparations', 'environmental antigens', 'adjacent skin']",Herein,that prevention,allergic rhinitis,possibly other disorders,the immune system,the daily application,preparations,environmental antigens,adjacent skin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sensitivities to neutralization with antibodies. The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. All viruses replicated efficiently, but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals. In contrast, severe clinical disease, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, alveolitis, and death were noted in 12-month-old mice inoculated with the palm civet HC/SZ/61/03 strain or early-human-phase GZ02 variants but not with related middle- and late-phase epidemic or raccoon dog strains. This panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing zoonotic and human epidemic spike glycoproteins will provide heterologous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoonotic reintroductions as well as provide the appropriate model system for elucidating the complex virus-host interactions that contribute to more-severe and fatal SARS-CoV disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly.","The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains.","['not_the_zoonotic_variants', 'human_airway_epithelial_cultures', 'earlier_hypotheses', 'zoonotic_isolates', 'humans', 'highly_pathogenic_strains']","['not the zoonotic variants', 'human airway epithelial cultures', 'earlier hypotheses', 'zoonotic isolates', 'humans', 'highly pathogenic strains']",not the zoonotic variants,human airway epithelial cultures,earlier hypotheses,zoonotic isolates,humans,highly pathogenic strains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As resistance traits are difficult or impossible to measure directly, potential indirect criteria are measures of immune traits (ITs). Our underlying hypothesis is that levels of ITs with no focus on specific pathogens define an individual's immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general. Since variation in ITs depends on genetic, environmental and probably epigenetic factors, our aim was to estimate the relative importance of genetics. In this report, we present a large genetic survey of innate and adaptive ITs in pig families bred in the same environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fifty four ITs were studied on 443 Large White pigs vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and analyzed by combining a principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic parameter estimation. ITs include specific and non specific antibodies, seric inflammatory proteins, cell subsets by hemogram and flow cytometry, ex vivo production of cytokines (IFNα, TNFα, IL6, IL8, IL12, IFNγ, IL2, IL4, IL10), phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. While six ITs had heritabilities that were weak or not significantly different from zero, 18 and 30 ITs had moderate (0.1<h2≤0.4) or high (h2>0.4) heritability values, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between ITs were weak except for a few traits that mostly include cell subsets. PCA revealed no cluster of innate or adaptive ITs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that variation in many innate and adaptive ITs is genetically controlled in swine, as already reported for a smaller number of traits by other laboratories. A limited redundancy of the traits was also observed confirming the high degree of complementarity between innate and adaptive ITs.

The complement system is involved in atherogenesis, and the complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role facilitating the clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. Limited evidence suggests that CR1 may be involved in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the relationship between CR1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk. Methods Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region (n = 73) on chromosome 1 were assessed in 5244 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age, country and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease. Results All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. In this region, strong LD was present leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (all p < 0.05). Moreover, most of the associated SNPs were also associated with levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected.

Virus infection increased the protein levels of the autophagy markers ATG16L1 and Beclin-1 and the autophagy regulator mTOR. LGG treatment during viral gastroenteritis reduced autophagy marker expression to normal levels, induced apoptosis and partially prevented virus-induced tissue damage.

Previous work has shown that systemic immunization against adenovirus after vector delivery to the brain results in complete loss of brain cells infected by adenoviral vectors. Although T cells play an important role in this process, we demonstrate herein that B cells also significantly regulate transgene expression from the CNS. After the systemic immunization against adenovirus of animals injected via the brain with an adenoviral vector 30 days earlier, we uncovered substantial infiltration by CD19(+) B cells of the area of the brain transduced by the virus. This suggests the involvement of B cells in the adaptive immune response-mediated loss of transduced cells from the brain. Confocal analysis of these brains demonstrated physical contacts between transduced brain cells and CD19(+) cells. To test the hypothesis that B cells play a causal role in the loss of infected cells from the brain, we demonstrated that animals devoid of B cells were unable to eliminate transgene expression at early time points after immunization. This demonstrates that B cells play a necessary role in the loss of transgene expression at early, but not late, time points postimmunization. Thus, these data have important implications for our understanding of the role of B cells as immune effectors during the immune-mediated clearance of viral infections from the CNS, and also for understanding mechanisms operating in brain autoimmunity, as well as for the potential safety of clinical gene therapy for brain diseases.","To test the hypothesis that B cells play a causal role in the loss of infected cells from the brain, we demonstrated that animals devoid of B cells were unable to eliminate transgene expression at early time points after immunization.","['the_hypothesis', 'B_cells', 'a_causal_role', 'the_loss', 'infected_cells', 'the_brain', 'animals', 'B_cells', 'transgene_expression', 'early_time_points', 'immunization']","['the hypothesis', 'B cells', 'a causal role', 'the loss', 'infected cells', 'the brain', 'animals', 'B cells', 'transgene expression', 'early time points', 'immunization']",the hypothesis,B cells,a causal role,the loss,infected cells,the brain,animals,B cells,transgene expression,early time points,immunization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In its favor, a growing number of publications report the successful discovery of new ligands, often supported by experimental affinity data and controls for artifacts. Few reports, however, actually test the underlying structural hypotheses that docking makes. To be successful and not just lucky, prospective docking must not only rank a true ligand among the top scoring compounds, it must also correctly orient the ligand so the score it receives is biophysically sound. If the correct binding pose is not predicted, a skeptic might well infer that the discovery was serendipitous. Surveying over 15 years of the docking literature, we were surprised to discover how rarely sufficient evidence is presented to establish whether docking actually worked for the right reasons. The paucity of experimental tests of theoretically predicted poses undermines confidence in a technique that has otherwise become widely accepted. Of course, solving a crystal structure is not always possible, and even when it is, it can be a lot of work, and is not readily accessible to all groups. Even when a structure can be determined, investigators may prefer to gloss over an erroneous structural prediction to better focus on their discovery. Still, the absence of a direct test of theory by experiment is a loss for method developers seeking to understand and improve docking methods.

Generic probiotic therapies have shown promise, but seem to lack specificity. We hypothesised that healthy children with no history of AOM carry protective commensal bacteria that could be translated into a specific probiotic therapy to break the cycle of re-infection. We characterised the nasopharyngeal microbiome of these children (controls) in comparison to children with rAOM (cases) to identify potentially protective bacteria. As some children with rAOM do not appear to carry any of the known otopathogens, we also hypothesised that characterisation of the middle ear microbiome could identify novel otopathogens, which may also guide the development of more effective therapies. RESULTS: Middle ear fluids, middle ear rinses and ear canal swabs from the cases and nasopharyngeal swabs from both groups underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The nasopharyngeal microbiomes of cases and controls were distinct. We observed a significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum in the nasopharynx of controls. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella were abundant in the middle ear and ear canal of cases, but were uncommon in the nasopharynx of both groups. Gemella and Neisseria were characteristic of the case nasopharynx, but were not prevalent in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are characteristic of a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella are possible novel otopathogens, though their rarity in the nasopharynx and prevalence in the ear canal means that their role as normal aural flora cannot be ruled out. Gemella and Neisseria are unlikely to be novel otopathogens as they do not appear to colonise the middle ear in children with rAOM.

Frameshifting permits expression of more than one polypeptide from an otherwise monocistronic mRNA, and can restore expression of polypeptides in the face of frameshift mutations. A common mutation conferring acyclovir resistance in patients with herpes simplex virus disease deletes one cytosine from a run of six cytosines (C-chord) in the viral thymidine kinase (tk) gene. However, this mutation does not abolish TK activity, which is important for pathogenicity. To investigate how this mutant retains TK activity, we engineered and analyzed viruses expressing epitope-tagged TK. We found that the mutant's TK activity can be accounted for by low levels of full-length TK polypeptide produced by net −1 frameshifting during translation. The efficiency of frameshifting was relatively high, 3–5%, as the polypeptide from the reading frame generated by the deletion, which lacks stop codons (nonstop), was poorly expressed mainly because of inefficient protein synthesis. Stop codons introduced into this reading frame greatly increased its expression, but greatly decreased the level of full-length TK, indicating that frameshifting is strongly stimulated by a new mechanism, nonstop mRNA, which we hypothesize involves stalling of ribosomes on the polyA tail. Mutational studies indicated that frameshifting occurs on or near the C-chord, a region lacking a canonical slippery sequence. Nonstop stimulation of frameshifting also occurred when the C-chord was replaced with a canonical slippery sequence from HIV. This mechanism thus permits biologically and clinically relevant TK synthesis, and may occur more generally.","Stop codons introduced into this reading frame greatly increased its expression, but greatly decreased the level of full-length TK, indicating that frameshifting is strongly stimulated by a new mechanism, nonstop mRNA, which we hypothesize involves stalling of ribosomes on the polyA tail.","['codons', 'this_reading_frame greatly increased its_expression', 'full-length_TK', 'frameshifting', 'a_new_mechanism', 'nonstop_mRNA', 'stalling', 'ribosomes']","['codons', 'this reading frame greatly increased its expression', 'full-length TK', 'frameshifting', 'a new mechanism', 'nonstop mRNA', 'stalling', 'ribosomes']",codons,this reading frame greatly increased its expression,full-length TK,frameshifting,a new mechanism,nonstop mRNA,stalling,ribosomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the S1 gene showed that isolate I1101/16 was genetically close to strain ck/CH/LJL/140901, which belongs to the TW I genotype (also known as lineage GI-7 based on the recent IBV classification), however the S2 gene showed genetic diversity comparing to that of S1 gene. Comparison of the genomic sequences showed that the genome of isolate I1101/16 was similar to that of strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 from the 5′ end of the genome to the 5′ end of the S2 gene and from the 5′ end of the 3a gene to the end of the genome, whereas the remaining parts of the genome sequences were more closely related to those of strain 4/91 than those of ck/CH/LJL/140901, thereby suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. SimPlot and Bootscan analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, where it showed that isolate I1101/16 arose through recombination events between ck/CH/LJL/140901- and 4/91-like viruses. Isolate I1101/16 and strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 shared identical amino acids in almost all five of their B cell epitopes, but the two viruses had a serotype relatedness value of 65, which is well below 80, i.e., the lower cutoff value for viruses of the same serotype. In addition, pathogenicity tests demonstrated that isolate I1101/16 was more pathogenic to 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens than strain ck/CH/LJL/140901, according to analysis of the clinical signs, whereas strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 exhibited prolonged replication and shedding after challenge compared with isolate I1101/16.

However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) relative to MHV-ExoN(−), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.",Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication.,"['Our_results', 'CoV_replication_fidelity', 'the_hypothesis', 'functions', 'nsp14-ExoN_activity', 'virus_replication']","['Our results', 'CoV replication fidelity', 'the hypothesis', 'functions', 'nsp14-ExoN activity', 'virus replication']",Our results,CoV replication fidelity,the hypothesis,functions,nsp14-ExoN activity,virus replication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that comprehensive national data on ICU resources would permit a better understanding of regional differences in system capacity. METHODS: After the 2009–2010 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group surveyed all acute care hospitals in Canada to assess ICU capacity. Using a structured survey tool administered to physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses, we determined the number of ICU beds, ventilators, and the ability to provide specialized support for respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 286 hospitals with 3170 ICU beds and 4982 mechanical ventilators for critically ill patients. Twenty-two hospitals had an ICU that routinely cared for children; 15 had dedicated pediatric ICUs. Per 100,000 population, there was substantial variability in provincial capacity, with a mean of 0.9 hospitals with ICUs (provincial range 0.4-2.8), 10 ICU beds capable of providing mechanical ventilation (provincial range 6–19), and 15 invasive mechanical ventilators (provincial range 10–24). There was only moderate correlation between ventilation capacity and population size (coefficient of determination (R(2)) = 0.771). CONCLUSION: ICU resources vary widely across Canadian provinces, and during times of increased demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically ill patients. These results highlight the need to evolve inter-jurisdictional resource sharing during periods of substantial increase in demand, and provide background data for the development of appropriate critical care capacity benchmarks.

However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.

We previously showed that HMPV binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and that HMPV binding requires only the viral fusion (F) protein. To characterize the features of this interaction critical for HMPV binding and the role of this interaction in infection in relevant models, we utilized sulfated polysaccharides, heparan sulfate mimetics, and occluding compounds. Iota-carrageenan demonstrated potent anti-HMPV activity by inhibiting binding to lung cells mediated by the F protein. Furthermore, analysis of a minilibrary of variably sulfated derivatives of Escherichia coli K5 polysaccharide mimicking the HS structure revealed that the highly O-sulfated K5 polysaccharides inhibited HMPV infection, identifying a potential feature of HS critical for HMPV binding. The peptide dendrimer SB105-A10, which binds HS, reduced binding and infection in an F-dependent manner, suggesting that occlusion of HS at the target cell surface is sufficient to prevent infection. HMPV infection was also inhibited by these compounds during apical infection of polarized airway tissues, suggesting that these interactions take place during HMPV infection in a physiologically relevant model. These results reveal key features of the interaction between HMPV and HS, supporting the hypothesis that apical HS in the airway serves as a binding factor during infection, and HS modulating compounds may serve as a platform for potential antiviral development.

However, biomedical open data is accessible and reusable for reanalysis and generation of a new hypotheses and discovery. In this study, we leverage biomedical data and tools to analyze available data on Nipah Virus (NiV) infection. NiV infection is an emerging zoonosis that is transmissible to humans and is associated with high mortality rates. In this study, explored the application of computational drug repositioning and chemogenomic enrichment analyses using host transcriptome data to match drugs that could reverse the virus-induced gene signature. We performed analyses using two gene signatures: i) A previously published gene signature (n=34), and ii) a gene signature generated using the characteristic direction method (n= 5,533). Our predictive framework suggests that several drugs including FDA approved therapies like beclometasone, trihexyphenidyl, S-propranolol etc. could modulate the NiV infection induced gene signatures in endothelial cells. A target specific analysis of CXCL10 also suggests the potential application of Eldelumab, an investigative therapy for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, as a putative candidate for drug repositioning. To conclude, we also discuss challenges and opportunities in clinical trials (n-of-1 and adaptive trials) for repositioned drugs. Further follow-up studies including biochemical assays and clinical trials are required to identify effective therapies for clinical use. Our proof-of-concept study highlights that translational bioinformatics methods including gene expression analyses and computational drug repositioning could augment epidemiological investigations in the context of an emerging disease with no effective treatment.","However, biomedical open data is accessible and reusable for reanalysis and generation of a new hypotheses and discovery.","['biomedical_open_data', 'reanalysis', 'generation', 'a_new_hypotheses', 'discovery']","['biomedical open data', 'reanalysis', 'generation', 'a new hypotheses', 'discovery']",biomedical open data,reanalysis,generation,a new hypotheses,discovery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, rats were housed in both types of caging and given compounds to induce a variety of subtle clinical signs common to toxicology studies including chromodacryorrhea, soft stool, stereotypic behaviors, mild hypoactivity, abnormal postures, and discolored urine. For one comparison, fecal pellets were removed to simulate decreased production of feces.

The technicians who administered the treatments verified that clinical signs were present before and after the blinded technicians made their observations.

We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing that occurred during the course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38%, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R(0), was estimated to be in the range of 1.6–2.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R(0), implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection. This reduction in the clinical attack rate translates to an estimated 260 per 100 000 lives having been saved, and suggests that social distancing interventions could play a major role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.",We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’.,"['the_hypothesis', 'these_waves', 'people', 'potentially_infectious_contacts', 'a_behaviour', '‘ social distancing']","['the hypothesis', 'these waves', 'people', 'potentially infectious contacts', 'a behaviour', '‘ social distancing']",the hypothesis,these waves,people,potentially infectious contacts,a behaviour,‘ social distancing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination.

Modeling this within rhesus macaques is complicated because human adenoviruses, including human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5), are not endogenous to macaques. Here, we tested whether vaccination with a rhesus macaque-derived adenoviral vector (simian adenovirus 7 [SAdV-7]) enhances mucosal T cell activation within rhesus macaques. Following intramuscular SAdV-7 vaccination, we observed a pronounced increase in SAdV-7-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in peripheral blood and, more dramatically, in rectal mucosa tissue. Vaccination also induced a significant increase in the frequency of activated memory CD4(+) T cells in SAdV-7- and HAdV-5-vaccinated animals in the rectal mucosa but not in peripheral blood. These fluctuations within the rectal mucosa were also associated with a pronounced decrease in the relative frequency of naive resting CD4(+) T cells. Together, these results indicate that peripheral vaccination with an AdV vector can increase the activation of mucosal CD4(+) T cells, potentially providing an experimental model to further evaluate the role of host-vector interactions in increased HIV acquisition after AdV vector vaccination.

The debate involves the mode of transmission of a simian virus (SIV) to humans. Both major camps in the argument presume that humans are normally free of such viruses and assume that once the simian virus was transmitted, it immediately infected some T-cells and caused the release of toxic agents that killed off bystander (uninfected) T-cells resulting in AIDS. The evolution of the Simian virus (SIV) into a human virus (HIV) is regarded as an artifact. In contrast, a fundamentally different hypothesis has been proposed [Parris GE. Med Hypotheses 2004;62(3):354–7] in which it is presumed that in hyper-endemic areas of malaria (central Africa), all primates (humans and non-human primates) have shared a retrovirus that augments their T-cell response to the malaria parasite. The virus can be called “primate T-cell retrovirus” (PTRV). Over thousands of years the virus has crossed species lines many times (with little effect) and typically adapts to the host quickly. In this model, AIDS is seen to be the result of the development of resistance of the virus (PTRV) to continuous exposure to pro-apoptotic (schizonticidal) aminoquinoline drugs used to prevent malaria. The hypothesis was originally proposed based on biochemical activities of the aminoquinolines (e.g., pamaquine (plasmoquine(TM)), primaquine and chloroquine), but recent publications demonstrated that some of these drugs definitely adversely affect HIV and other viruses and logically would cause them to evolve resistance. Review of the timeline that has been created for the evolution of HIV in humans is also shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with this hypothesis (and not with either version of the conventional hypothesis). SARS and Ebola also fit this pattern.","In contrast, a fundamentally different hypothesis has been proposed [Parris GE.","['contrast', 'a_fundamentally_different_hypothesis', 'Parris', 'GE']","['contrast', 'a fundamentally different hypothesis', 'Parris', 'GE']",contrast,a fundamentally different hypothesis,Parris,GE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensive metagenomic studies of different organs/tissues from bats have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viruses. To elucidate viral diversity and epidemiological and phylogenetic characteristics, six pooled fecal samples from bats were generated (based on bat species and geographic regions characteristic for virome analysis). These contained 500 fecal samples from six bat species, collected in four geographic regions. Metagenomic analysis revealed a plethora of divergent viruses originally found in bats. Multiple contigs from influenza A virus and coronaviruses in bats shared high identity with those from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission, whereas a number of contigs, whose sequences were taxonomically classifiable within Alphapapillomavirus, Betaretrovirus, Alpharetrovirus, Varicellovirus, Cyprinivirus, Chlorovirus and Cucumovirus had low identity to viruses in existing databases, which indicated possible evolution of novel viral species. None of the established caliciviruses and picornaviruses were found in the 500 fecal specimens. Papillomaviruses with high amino acid identity were found in Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi, challenging the hypotheses regarding the strict host specificity and co-evolution of papillomaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four bat rotavirus A strains might be tentative G3 strains, according to the Rotavirus Classification Working Group classification.

We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8(+) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8(+) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses.",We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen.,"['this_approach', 'more_robust_cellular_immune_responses', 'the_vaccines', 'a_homologous_prime-boost_regimen']","['this approach', 'more robust cellular immune responses', 'the vaccines', 'a homologous prime-boost regimen']",this approach,more robust cellular immune responses,the vaccines,a homologous prime-boost regimen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations were obtained by the overlay of JHMV-infected cells onto receptor-negative cells that are otherwise resistant to wt JHMV infection. MHVR-independent infection is hypothetically thought to be attributed to a naturally occurring fusion activation of the wt JHMV S protein, which did not occur in the case of srr7. Attachment of S protein on cells without MHVR during the S-protein activation process seems to be a key condition. Thus, in the present study, we tried to see whether wt JHMV virions that are attached on MHVR-negative cells are able to infect those cells. In order to make virions attach to the cell surface without MHVR, we have used spinoculation, namely, the centrifugation of cells together with inoculated virus at 3,000 rpm for 2 h. This procedure forces viruses to attach to the cell surface, as revealed by quantitative estimation of attached virions by real-time PCR and also facilitated wt JHMV infection to MHVR-negative cells, but failed to do so for srr7. Virions of both wt and srr7 attached on MHVR-negative cells by spinoculation were facilitated for infection in the presence of a soluble form of MHVR that induces conformational changes of both wt and srr7. It was further revealed that wt JHMV S1, but not srr7, was released from the cell surface when S protein was expressed on cells. These observations support the hypothesis that attachment of the virion to MHVR-negative cells is a critical step and that a unique feature of wt JHMV S1 to be released from S2 in a naturally occurring event is involved in an MHVR-independent infection.",These observations support the hypothesis that attachment of the virion to MHVR-negative cells is a critical step and that a unique feature of wt JHMV S1 to be released from S2 in a naturally occurring event is involved in an MHVR-independent infection.,"['These_observations', 'the_hypothesis that_attachment', 'the_virion', 'MHVR-negative_cells', 'a_critical_step', 'a_unique_feature', 'wt_JHMV_S1', 'S2', 'a_naturally_occurring_event', 'an_MHVR-independent_infection']","['These observations', 'the hypothesis that attachment', 'the virion', 'MHVR-negative cells', 'a critical step', 'a unique feature', 'wt JHMV S1', 'S2', 'a naturally occurring event', 'an MHVR-independent infection']",These observations,the hypothesis that attachment,the virion,MHVR-negative cells,a critical step,a unique feature,wt JHMV S1,S2,a naturally occurring event,an MHVR-independent infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We get some insight by considering demands a virus places on host cells. Viruses not only require production of their own proteins, RNA and/or DNA, but also production of additional cellular machinery, such as ribosomes, to handle the increased demands. Since the nucleolus is a major site of RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleoli are targeted by viruses, directly when viral RNA and proteins enter the nucleolus and indirectly when viruses induce increased expression of cellular polyamine genes. Polyamines are at high levels in nucleoli to assist in RNA folding. The size and activity of nucleoli increase directly with increases in polyamines. Nucleolar expansion due to abnormal increases in polyamines could disrupt nearby chromatin, such as the inactive X chromosome, leading to expression of previously sequestered DNA. Sudden expression of a large concentration of Alu elements from the disrupted inactive X can compete with RNA transcripts containing intronic Alu sequences that normally maintain nucleolar structural integrity. Such disruption of nucleolar activity can lead to misfolded RNAs, misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Many autoantigens in lupus are, at least transiently, components of the nucleolus. Considering these effects of viruses, the “X chromosome–nucleolus nexus” hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","Considering these effects of viruses, the “X chromosome–nucleolus nexus” hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","['these_effects', 'viruses', 'nucleolus_nexus”_hypothesis', 'disruption', 'the_inactive_X', 'the_nucleolus', 'stress', 'subsequent_disruption', 'the_nucleolus', 'previously_sequestered_Alu_elements', 'the_nucleolus', 'generation', 'autoantigens']","['these effects', 'viruses', 'nucleolus nexus” hypothesis', 'disruption', 'the inactive X', 'the nucleolus', 'stress', 'subsequent disruption', 'the nucleolus', 'previously sequestered Alu elements', 'the nucleolus', 'generation', 'autoantigens']",these effects,viruses,nucleolus nexus” hypothesis,disruption,the inactive X,the nucleolus,stress,subsequent disruption,the nucleolus,previously sequestered Alu elements,the nucleolus,generation,autoantigens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks, leading to massive transmissions to humans. Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans. METHODOLOGY: We explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies (IgG) specific against Sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis. Antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 49), healthy cats (n = 19), and cats with other diseases (n = 20). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis (area under the curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1; P<0.0001) versus controls. The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents. One-dimensional immunoblotting indicated that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (a 60-kDa protein in S. brasiliensis and a 70-kDa protein in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant antigen in feline sporotrichosis. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed six IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60 in the S. brasiliensis proteome, similar to the humoral response found in human sporotrichosis. CONCLUSIONS: A convergent IgG-response in various hosts (mice, cats, and humans) has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of Sporothrix and its warm-blooded hosts. We propose that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase has potential for the serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis and as target for the development of an effective multi-species vaccine against sporotrichosis in animals and humans.","The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents.","['The_two_sets', 'Sporothrix_antigens', 'the_hypothesis', 'antigenic_epitopes', 'closely_related_agents']","['The two sets', 'Sporothrix antigens', 'the hypothesis', 'antigenic epitopes', 'closely related agents']",The two sets,Sporothrix antigens,the hypothesis,antigenic epitopes,closely related agents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the use of a genetic approach lends further support to the hypothesis that alterations affecting the ribosome’s peptidyltransferase activity lead to changes in frameshifting efficiency and virus loss. Mutations in the RPL3 gene, which encodes a ribosomal protein located at the peptidyltransferase center, promote approximately three- to fourfold increases in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies and loss of the M(1) killer virus of yeast. The mak8-1 allele of RPL3 contains two adjacent missense mutations which are predicted to structurally alter the Mak8-1p. Furthermore, a second allele that encodes the N-terminal 100 amino acids of L3 (called L3Δ) exerts a trans-dominant effect on programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting and killer virus maintenance.

However, this treatment has a limited efficacy and is associated with a significant number of serious adverse effects, particularly infectious. Alternative treatments are therefore required.

METHODS: Infants infected with RSV representing extremes of clinical severity were studied. Mild illness (n = 23) was defined as a respiratory rate (RR) < 55 and room air oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) ≥ 97%, and severe illness (n = 23) was defined as RR ≥ 65 and SaO2 ≤ 92%.

Recently, based on our model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoOLigomerization (SCHOOL) model, we suggested specific molecular mechanisms used by different viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to modulate the host immune response mediated by members of the family of multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs). This family includes T cell receptor (TCR) that is critically involved in immune diseases such as autoimmune arthritis. In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis. Using the SCHOOL approach and the SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence, we rationally designed a novel immunomodulatory peptide that targets TCR. We showed that this peptide ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice and protects against bone and cartilage damage. Incorporation of the peptide into self-assembling lipopeptide nanoparticles that mimic native human high density lipoproteins significantly increases peptide dosage efficacy. Together, our data further confirm that viral immune evasion strategies that target MIRRs can be transferred to therapeutic strategies that require similar functionalities.","In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis.","['the_present_study', 'compelling experimental', 'vivo_evidence', 'support', 'our_hypothesis']","['the present study', 'compelling experimental', 'vivo evidence', 'support', 'our hypothesis']",the present study,compelling experimental,vivo evidence,support,our hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CoVs encode a proofreading 3′→5′exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.IMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.",These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.,"['These_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'high-fidelity_replication', 'CoV_fitness', 'CoV_replication_fidelity']","['These results', 'the hypothesis', 'high-fidelity replication', 'CoV fitness', 'CoV replication fidelity']",These results,the hypothesis,high-fidelity replication,CoV fitness,CoV replication fidelity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, −0.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population.","We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy.","['influenza_transmission', 'a_ten-year_time_period', 'a_population', 'a_two-child_policy', 'a_hypothesis', 'child', 'couple', 'policy', 'a_negligible_difference', 'the_average_annual_attack_rate', 'the_population', 'the_one-child_policy']","['influenza transmission', 'a ten-year time period', 'a population', 'a two-child policy', 'a hypothesis', 'child', 'couple', 'policy', 'a negligible difference', 'the average annual attack rate', 'the population', 'the one-child policy']",influenza transmission,a ten-year time period,a population,a two-child policy,a hypothesis,child,couple,policy,a negligible difference,the average annual attack rate,the population,the one-child policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, this system was used to map signals within the RUBV genome that mediate packaging of viral RNA. Mutations within a proposed packaging signal did not significantly affect relative packaging efficiency. The insertion of various fragments derived from the RUBV genome into Sindbis virus replicons revealed that there are several regions within the RUBV genome capable of enhancing encapsidation of heterologous replicon RNAs. Secondly, the trans-encapsidation system was used to analyse the effect of alterations within the capsid protein (CP) on release of VRPs and subsequent initiation of replication in newly infected cells. Deletion of the N-terminal eight amino acids of the CP reduced VRP titre significantly, which could be partially complemented by native CP provided in trans, indicating that this mutation affected an entry or post-entry event in the replication cycle.

Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-of-a-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machine-learning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public expression data sets, reformulated to create a test bed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading methods, and show that CSAX aids in both identifying anomalies and explaining their underlying biology. We describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks. We then illustrate CSAX's value in two developmental case studies. Confirming prior hypotheses, CSAX highlights disruption of platelet activation pathways in a neonate with retinopathy of prematurity and identifies, for the first time, dysregulated oxidative stress response in second trimester amniotic fluid of fetuses with obese mothers.

To establish a productive infection in new host species, viruses must overcome barriers to replication mediated by diverse and rapidly evolving host restriction factors such as protein kinase R (PKR). Many viral antagonists of these restriction factors are species specific. For example, the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist, RhTRS1, inhibits PKR in some African green monkey (AGM) cells, but does not inhibit human or rhesus macaque PKR. To model the evolutionary changes necessary for cross-species transmission, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses RhTRS1 in a strain that lacks PKR inhibitors E3L and K3L (VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1). Serially passaging VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 in minimally-permissive AGM cells increased viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Notably, adaptation in these AGM cells also improved virus replication 1000- to 10,000-fold in human and rhesus cells. Genetic analyses including deep sequencing revealed amplification of the rhtrs1 locus in the adapted viruses. Supplying additional rhtrs1 in trans confirmed that amplification alone was sufficient to improve VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 replication. Viruses with amplified rhtrs1 completely blocked AGM PKR, but only partially blocked human PKR, consistent with the replication properties of these viruses in AGM and human cells. Finally, in contrast to AGM-adapted viruses, which could be serially propagated in human cells, VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 yielded no progeny virus after only three passages in human cells. Thus, rhtrs1 amplification in a minimally permissive intermediate host was a necessary step, enabling expansion of the virus range to previously nonpermissive hosts. These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","['These_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that amplification', 'a_weak_viral_antagonist', 'replication', 'otherwise_resistant_host_species', 'a_molecular_foothold', 'further_adaptations', 'efficient_replication', 'the_new_host']","['These data', 'support', 'the hypothesis', 'that amplification', 'a weak viral antagonist', 'replication', 'otherwise resistant host species', 'a molecular foothold', 'further adaptations', 'efficient replication', 'the new host']",These data,support,the hypothesis,that amplification,a weak viral antagonist,replication,otherwise resistant host species,a molecular foothold,further adaptations,efficient replication,the new host,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with ALI/ARDS have alveolar epithelial injury, which may be worsened by high-pressure mechanical ventilation. Alveolar type II (ATII) cells are the progenitor cells for the alveolar epithelium and are required to reestablish the alveolar epithelium during the recovery process from ALI/ARDS. Lung fibroblasts (FBs) migrate and proliferate early after lung injury and likely are an important source of growth factors for epithelial repair. However, how lung FBs affect epithelial wound healing in the human adult lung has not been investigated in detail. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is known to be released mainly from FBs and to stimulate both migration and proliferation of primary rat ATII cells. HGF is also increased in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum in patients with ALI/ARDS. Therefore, we hypothesized that HGF secreted by FBs would enhance wound closure in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Wound closure was measured using a scratch wound-healing assay in primary human AEC monolayers and in a coculture system with FBs. We found that wound closure was accelerated by FBs mainly through HGF/c-Met signaling. HGF also restored impaired wound healing in AECs from the elderly subjects and after exposure to cyclic stretch.

Two systems were used to analyze the effect of different antibodies on PrP(Sc) formation: (i) neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with the 22L mouse-adapted scrapie stain, and (ii) protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), which uses PrP(Sc) as a template or seed, and a series of incubations and sonications, to convert PrP(C) to PrP(Sc).

Based on the numerous and varied Mabs analyzed, the inhibitory effect does not appear to be epitope specific, related to PrP(C) conformation, or to cell membrane localization, but is influenced by the targeted PrP region (amino vs carboxy).",We hypothesized that antibodies binding to either PrP(c)or PrP(Sc) would hinder or prevent the formation of the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) complex and thus slow down or prevent the conversion process.,"['antibodies', 'either_PrP(c)or', 'PrP(Sc', 'the_formation', 'the_PrP(C)–PrP(Sc)_complex', 'the_conversion_process']","['antibodies', 'either PrP(c)or', 'PrP(Sc', 'the formation', 'the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) complex', 'the conversion process']",antibodies,either PrP(c)or,PrP(Sc,the formation,the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) complex,the conversion process,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both clinical trials and animal models of type I and type II diabetes have shown that hyperactivity of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications. Of clinical relevance, blockade of the renin–angiotensin system prevents new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of diabetic complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently discovered mono-carboxypeptidase and the first homolog of ACE. It is thought to inhibit Ang-II signaling cascades mostly by cleaving Ang-II to generate Ang-(1–7), which effects oppose Ang-II and are mediated by the Mas receptor. The enzyme is present in the kidney, liver, adipose tissue and pancreas. Its expression is elevated in the endocrine pancreas in diabetes and in the early phase during diabetic nephropathy. ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, we have shown the presence of the Mas receptor in the mouse pancreas and observed a reduction in Mas receptor immuno-reactivity as well as higher fasting blood glucose levels in ACE2 knockout mice, indicating that these mice may be a new model to study the role of ACE2 in diabetes. In this review we will examine the role of the renin–angiotensin system in the physiopathology and treatment of diabetes and highlight the potential benefits of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis, focusing on recent data about ACE2.",ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.,"['ACE2', 'a_compensatory_manner', 'both_diabetes', 'diabetic_nephropathy']","['ACE2', 'a compensatory manner', 'both diabetes', 'diabetic nephropathy']",ACE2,a compensatory manner,both diabetes,diabetic nephropathy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed the feasibility of a crucial viral replication factor, namely, importin-α7, as a cellular drug target to combat pandemic influenza viruses. Surprisingly, only five viral lung-to-lung passages were required to achieve 100% lethality in importin-α7(−/−) mice that otherwise are resistant. Viral escape from importin-α7 requirement was mediated by five mutations in the viral ribonucleoprotein complex and the surface glycoproteins. Moreover, the importin-α7(−/−) mouse-adapted strain became even more virulent for wild-type mice than the parental strain. These studies show that targeting host proteins may still result in viral escape by alternative pathways, eventually giving rise to even more virulent virus strains. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach to reduce viral drug resistance. IMPORTANCE Here, we investigated the long-standing hypothesis based on in vitro studies that viral drug resistance occurrence is less likely if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins. Here, we challenged this hypothesis by analyzing, in an in vivo animal model, the feasibility of targeting the cellular factor importin-α7, which is crucial for human influenza virus replication and pathogenesis, as an efficient antiviral strategy against pandemic influenza viruses. In summary, our studies suggest that resistance against cellular factors is possible in vivo, and the emergence of even more virulent viral escape variants calls for particular caution.

Surface expression of CD11a and CD49d has been shown to identify antigen-specific CD4 T cells against viral pathogens in mice. We hypothesized that CD11a and CD49d would also serve as markers of human antigen-specific T cells responding to vaccination. METHODS: A phase I vaccine trial enabled us to evaluate a novel gating strategy based on surface expression of CD11a and CD49d as a means of detecting antigen-specific, cytokine producing CD4 and CD8 T cells induced after vaccination of naïve individuals against leishmaniasis. Three study groups received LEISH-F3 recombinant protein combined with either squalene oil-in-water emulsion (SE) alone, SE with the synthetic TLR-4 ligand glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA-SE), or SE with Salmonella minnesota-derived monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL-SE). Individuals were given 3 vaccine doses, on days 0, 28 and 168. RESULTS: Starting after the first vaccine dose, the frequency of both CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) CD4 and CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) CD8 T cells significantly increased over time throughout the 24-week trial. To confirm the role of CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) expression in the identification of the antigen-specific T cells, cytokine production was measured following LEISH-F3 stimulation. All of the IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 producing cells were found within the CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) population.

Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density.

Information about BCRP function in EVTs is limited, however placental exposure to bacterial/viral infection leads to BCRP downregulation in syncitiotrophoblasts. We hypothesized that BCRP is involved in the regulation of EVT function and is modulated by infection/inflammation.

This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most, but not all parts of the tree of mammalian CoVs. We next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co-segregation of CoVs and bat hosts encompassing the Betacoronavirus clades b and d, with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals, then present examples of CoVs infecting different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other. We also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat CoVs, and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hotspots in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We then present evidence for a zoonotic origin of four of the six known human CoVs (HCoV), three of which likely involved bats, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E; compare the available data on CoV pathogenesis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts; and discuss hypotheses on the putative insect origins of CoV ancestors. Finally, we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoonotic potential of bat viruses, based only on genomic sequence data, and emphasize the need to preserve these ecologically highly relevant animals.

Preventing the entry of EBOV into host cells is an attractive antiviral strategy, which has been validated for HIV by the FDA approval of the anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide. To identify inhibitors of EBOV entry, the EBOV envelope glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) gene was used to generate pseudotype viruses for screening of chemical libraries. A benzodiazepine derivative (compound 7) was identified from a high-throughput screen (HTS) of small-molecule compound libraries utilizing the pseudotype virus. Compound 7 was validated as an inhibitor of infectious EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) in cell-based assays, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 10 μM and 12 μM, respectively. Time-of-addition and binding studies suggested that compound 7 binds to EBOV-GP at an early stage during EBOV infection. Preliminary Schrödinger SiteMap calculations, using a published EBOV-GP crystal structure in its prefusion conformation, suggested a hydrophobic pocket at or near the GP1 and GP2 interface as a suitable site for compound 7 binding. This prediction was supported by mutational analysis implying that residues Asn69, Leu70, Leu184, Ile185, Leu186, Lys190, and Lys191 are critical for the binding of compound 7 and its analogs with EBOV-GP. We hypothesize that compound 7 binds to this hydrophobic pocket and as a consequence inhibits EBOV infection of cells, but the details of the mechanism remain to be determined.

To achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences (RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution.

The expression of B0AT1 in kidney was recently shown to depend on its association with collectrin (Tmem27), a protein homologous to the membrane-anchoring domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. Methods Because collectrin is almost absent from small intestine, we tested the hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B0AT1 in enterocytes. Furthermore, because B0AT1 expression depends on an associated protein, we tested the hypothesis that Hartnup-causing B0AT1 mutations differentially impact on B0AT1 interaction with intestinal and kidney accessory proteins. Results Immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and functional experiments using wild-type and ace2-null mice showed that expression of B0AT1 in small intestine critically depends on ACE2. Coexpressing new and previously identified Hartnup disorder–causing missense mutations of B0AT1 with either collectrin or ACE2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the high-frequency D173N and the newly identified P265L mutant B0AT1 transporters can still be activated by ACE2 but not collectrin coexpression.

Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.","Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma.","['parvoviruses', 'cell_division', 'the_virus', 'the_constantly_dividing_cancer_cells', 'the_cause', 'the_histiocytic_sarcoma']","['parvoviruses', 'cell division', 'the virus', 'the constantly dividing cancer cells', 'the cause', 'the histiocytic sarcoma']",parvoviruses,cell division,the virus,the constantly dividing cancer cells,the cause,the histiocytic sarcoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1–7 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1–7 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels.

The receptor-binding subunit of GP must be cleaved (by endosomal cathepsins) in order for entry and infection to proceed. Cleavage appears to proceed through 50-kDa and 20-kDa intermediates, ultimately generating a key 19-kDa core. How 19-kDa GP is subsequently triggered to bind membranes and induce fusion remains a mystery. Here we show that 50-kDa GP cannot be triggered to bind to liposomes in response to elevated temperature but that 20-kDa and 19-kDa GP can. Importantly, 19-kDa GP can be triggered at temperatures ∼10°C lower than 20-kDa GP, suggesting that it is the most fusion ready form. Triggering by heat (or urea) occurs only at pH 5, not pH 7.5, and involves the fusion loop, as a fusion loop mutant is defective in liposome binding. We further show that mild reduction (preferentially at low pH) triggers 19-kDa GP to bind to liposomes, with the wild-type protein being triggered to a greater extent than the fusion loop mutant. Moreover, mild reduction inactivates pseudovirion infection, suggesting that reduction can also trigger 19-kDa GP on virus particles. Our results support the hypothesis that priming of EBOV GP, specifically to the 19-kDa core, potentiates GP to undergo subsequent fusion-relevant conformational changes. Our findings also indicate that low pH and an additional endosomal factor (possibly reduction or possibly a process mimicked by reduction) act as fusion triggers.","Our results support the hypothesis that priming of EBOV GP, specifically to the 19-kDa core, potentiates GP to undergo subsequent fusion-relevant conformational changes.","['Our_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'EBOV_GP', 'the_19-kDa_core', 'GP', 'subsequent_fusion-relevant_conformational_changes']","['Our results', 'the hypothesis', 'EBOV GP', 'the 19-kDa core', 'GP', 'subsequent fusion-relevant conformational changes']",Our results,the hypothesis,EBOV GP,the 19-kDa core,GP,subsequent fusion-relevant conformational changes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1α protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1α expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8±7.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5±3.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2±2.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6±2.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups.

In this study, we sought to use this signal transduction conduit against them by inhibiting multiple kinases that influence translation. Previous work indicated that several kinases involved in translation, including p70 S6K, p90RSK, ERK, and p38 MAPK, are phosphorylated following Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. Furthermore, inhibiting p70 S6K through treatment with the FDA approved drug rapamycin prevents RVFV pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSK’s upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication. Treatment with the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins and reduced RVFV titers. In contrast, treatment with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 alone had minimal influence on RVFV titers. The combination of PF-4708671 and BI-D1870 treatment resulted in robust inhibition of RVFV replication. Likewise, a synergistic inhibition of RVFV replication was observed with p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 combined with rapamycin treatment.

However, their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using “holes” (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12, and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44, and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively modest neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44, and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12, and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.",We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using “holes” (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire.,"['HIV-1', 'a_strategy', 'the_immunogenicity', 'the_highly_conserved_epitopes', 'such_antibodies', '“holes', 'absence', 'binding', 'these_epitopes', 'germline_antibodies', 'an_efficient_immune_response', 'the_human_germline_B_cell_receptor']","['HIV-1', 'a strategy', 'the immunogenicity', 'the highly conserved epitopes', 'such antibodies', '“holes', 'absence', 'binding', 'these epitopes', 'germline antibodies', 'an efficient immune response', 'the human germline B cell receptor']",HIV-1,a strategy,the immunogenicity,the highly conserved epitopes,such antibodies,“holes,absence,binding,these epitopes,germline antibodies,an efficient immune response,the human germline B cell receptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we characterized nsp4 proteinase mutants carrying either point mutations in the putative HR domain or a large deletion in the CTD. When tested in a reverse genetics system, three groups of mutants were recognized (wild-type-like, debilitated, and dead), which was in line with the expected impact of mutations on HR flexibility. When tested in a transient expression system, the effects of the mutations on the production and turnover of replicase proteins varied widely. They were cleavage product specific and revealed a pronounced modulating effect of moieties derived from the nsp1-3 region of pp1a.

Nurses are world’s largest health professional workforce and a critical resource for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Nonetheless, little is known about nurses’ engagement with dual practice. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature on nurses’ dual practice with the objective of generating hypotheses on its nature and consequences, and define a research agenda on the phenomenon. The Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological steps were followed to develop the research questions, identify relevant studies, include/exclude studies, extract the data, and report the findings. PRISMA guidelines were additionally used to conduct the review and report on results. RESULTS: Of the initial 194 records identified, a total of 35 met the inclusion criteria for nurses’ dual practice; the vast majority (65%) were peer-reviewed publications, followed by nursing magazine publications (19%), reports, and doctoral dissertations. Twenty publications focused on high-income countries, 16 on low- or middle-income ones, and two had a multi country perspective. Although holding multiple jobs not always amounted to dual practice, several ways were found for public-sector nurses to engage concomitantly in public and private employments, in regulated as well as in informal, casual fashions. Some of these forms were reported as particularly prevalent, from over 50% in Australia, Canada, and the UK, to 28% in South Africa. The opportunity to increase a meagre salary, but also a dissatisfaction with the main job and the flexibility offered by multiple job-holding arrangements, were among the reported reasons for engaging in these practices. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Limited and mostly circumstantial evidence exists on nurses’ dual practice, with the few existing studies suggesting that the phenomenon is likely to be very common and carry implications for health systems and nurses’ welfare worldwide. We offer an agenda for future research to consolidate the existing evidence and to further explore nurses’ motivation; without a better understanding of nurse dual practice, this will continue to be a largely ‘hidden’ element in nursing workforce policy and practice, with an unclear impact on the delivery of care.

We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection and that CS may contribute to this complication. METHODS: We retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. Differences in baseline factors, risk factors, and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPA. RESULTS: Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23 %) developed IPA 3 days after ICU admission. Five patients had proven and four had probable IPA. Significantly more IPA patients received CS within 7 days before ICU admission (78 versus 23 %, p = 0.002). IPA patients also received significantly higher doses of CS before ICU admission [hydrocortisone equivalent 800 (360–2,635) versus 0 (0–0) mg, p = 0.005]. On multivariate analysis, use of CS before ICU admission was independently associated with IPA [odds ratio (OR) 14.4 (2.0–101.6), p = 0.007]. CONCLUSIONS: IPA was diagnosed in 23 % of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 3 days after ICU admission. Our data suggest that use of CS 7 days before ICU admission is an independent risk factor for fungal superinfection. These findings may have consequences for clinical practice as they point out the need for increased awareness of IPA, especially in those critically ill H1N1 patients already receiving CS.",We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection and that CS may contribute to this complication.,"['invasive_pulmonary_aspergillosis', '( IPA', 'a_frequent_complication', 'critically_ill_patients', 'H1N1_virus_infection', 'CS', 'this_complication']","['invasive pulmonary aspergillosis', '( IPA', 'a frequent complication', 'critically ill patients', 'H1N1 virus infection', 'CS', 'this complication']",invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,( IPA,a frequent complication,critically ill patients,H1N1 virus infection,CS,this complication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M2 is targeted to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, and the interaction of the viral proteins M2, M1, HA, and NA near glycolipid rafts in the apical plasma membrane is hypothesized to coordinate the assembly of infectious virus particles. To determine the role of M2 protein apical targeting in IAV replication, a panel of M2 proteins with basolateral plasma membrane (M2-Baso) or endoplasmic reticulum (M2-ER) targeting sequences was generated. MDCK II cells stably expressing M2-Baso, but not M2-ER, complemented the replication of M2-stop viruses. However, in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, viruses encoding M2-Baso and M2-ER replicated to negligible titers compared to those of wild-type virus. M2-Baso replication was negatively correlated with cell polarization. These results demonstrate that M2 apical targeting is essential for IAV replication: targeting M2 to the ER results in a strong, cell type-independent inhibition of virus replication, and targeting M2 to the basolateral membrane has greater effects in hNECs than in MDCK cells. IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus assembly and particle release occur at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The integral membrane proteins encoded by the virus, HA, NA, and M2, are all targeted to the apical membrane and believed to recruit the other structural proteins to sites of virus assembly. By targeting M2 to the basolateral or endoplasmic reticulum membranes, influenza A virus replication was significantly reduced. Basolateral targeting of M2 reduced the infectious virus titers with minimal effects on virus particle release, while targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum resulted in reduced infectious and total virus particle release. Therefore, altering the expression and the intracellular targeting of M2 has major effects on virus replication.","M2 is targeted to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, and the interaction of the viral proteins M2, M1, HA, and NA near glycolipid rafts in the apical plasma membrane is hypothesized to coordinate the assembly of infectious virus particles.","['M2', 'the_apical_plasma_membrane', 'polarized_epithelial_cells', 'the_interaction', 'the_viral_proteins M2', 'M1', 'HA', 'NA', 'glycolipid_rafts', 'the_apical_plasma_membrane', 'infectious_virus_particles']","['M2', 'the apical plasma membrane', 'polarized epithelial cells', 'the interaction', 'the viral proteins M2', 'M1', 'HA', 'NA', 'glycolipid rafts', 'the apical plasma membrane', 'infectious virus particles']",M2,the apical plasma membrane,polarized epithelial cells,the interaction,the viral proteins M2,M1,HA,NA,glycolipid rafts,the apical plasma membrane,infectious virus particles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current operative strategies include either direct nerve repair, nerve grafting, nerve transfer, or neurotization. The goal of this study is to compare muscle recovery using microneural repair versus neurotization in a rat model of chronic denervation. Methods Fifty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats had surgical denervation of the tibialis anterior muscle by transecting the common peroneal nerve. After 0, 8, 12, or 22 weeks of denervation, animals were assigned to either a direct repair or a neurotization cohort. An additional 7 animals were used for a sham cohort, and 7 of the 58 were used as controls. After a 12-week recovery period, animals had contractile strength and EMG testing of the tibialis anterior muscle. Peak force and characteristics were compared to the unoperated, contralateral limb. Tibialis anterior muscles were then harvested for mass and histologic evaluation. Results Sixty-two animals completed testing. Denervated controls demonstrated a significant decrease in muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor nerve conduction amplitude compared to sham animals. In all groups, chronicity of denervation adversely affected functional recovery. On average, repair animals performed better than neurotization animals with respect to muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor amplitude. Differences in contractile force, however, were significant only at the 0 week denervation group (94% ± 30 vs 50% ± 20, repair vs neurotization). Neurotized muscles processed for histologic analysis demonstrated acetylcholinesterase activity at the nerve-muscle interface, confirming the formation of motor end plates de novo. Conclusions We demonstrated that neurotization is capable of reinnervating de novo end plates in chronically denervated muscle. Our data do not support the hypothesis that direct muscle neurotization is superior to nerve repair for functional restoration of chronically denervated muscle. However, as the duration of denervation increases, the difference between outcomes of the neurotization and repair group narrows, suggesting that neurotization may offer a viable surgical alternative in the setting of prolonged denervation.",Our data do not support the hypothesis that direct muscle neurotization is superior to nerve repair for functional restoration of chronically denervated muscle.,"['Our_data', 'the_hypothesis', 'direct_muscle_neurotization', 'nerve_repair', 'functional_restoration', 'chronically_denervated_muscle']","['Our data', 'the hypothesis', 'direct muscle neurotization', 'nerve repair', 'functional restoration', 'chronically denervated muscle']",Our data,the hypothesis,direct muscle neurotization,nerve repair,functional restoration,chronically denervated muscle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. METHODS: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. RESULTS: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem–loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","['TBEV_survival', 'nature', 'the_virus', 'circulates', 'infected_and_non-infected_ticks', 'local_rodents']","['TBEV survival', 'nature', 'the virus', 'circulates', 'infected and non-infected ticks', 'local rodents']",TBEV survival,nature,the virus,circulates,infected and non-infected ticks,local rodents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35.

Because HBoV is able to persist in the infected tissues, induces pro-fibrotic and pro- cancerogenic cytokines in vivo and in vitro, and is detected in colorectal and lung tumors, the virus may be involved in cancerogenesis at least as a cofactor. Recently it was shown that the adenotonsillar tissue is an important site of HBoV1 persistence and replication. Considering the background that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers were thought to be attributable to a HPV infection, a co-participation of HBoV in terms of a chronic virus infection might play a role in the cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tonsil tumor samples were screened for HBoV and HPV DNA. Positive tissue sections were afterward subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to identify HBoV and HPV infected cells. By use of an in vitro cell culture model with primary tonsil fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes infected by HBoV we tried to find the target cells of virus replication. MSI testing was based on a previously published protocol using a de-multiplexed PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device. Results: In total 62 of 103 (60, 19%) of the tonsil squamous cell carcinomas tested positive for HBoV DNA and 66 of 103 (66%) samples were identified as HPV positive. The FISH analysis revealed both double infection of HPV and HBoV in the same cells as well as single infections of both viruses within the tumor tissue. Twenty-two of 62 HBoV positive tumors tested HPV negative, 40 of 62 tissue sections were HBoV and HPV positive. We analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors for MSI. Of those four tonsils displayed MSI in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers.

Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are comprehensive and specific with respect to the pathogen but are rapid in reporting the data. It has proven difficult to implement these requirements on a large scale while maintaining patient privacy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the automated export, aggregation, and analysis of infectious disease diagnostic test results from clinical laboratories across the United States in a manner that protects patient confidentiality. We hypothesized that such a system could aid in monitoring the seasonal occurrence of respiratory pathogens and may have advantages with regard to scope and ease of reporting compared with existing surveillance systems. METHODS: We describe a system, BioFire Syndromic Trends, for rapid disease reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Deidentified patient test results from the BioFire FilmArray multiplex molecular diagnostic system are sent directly to a cloud database. Summaries of these data are displayed in near real time on the Syndromic Trends public website. We studied this dataset for the prevalence, seasonality, and coinfections of the 20 respiratory pathogens detected in over 362,000 patient samples acquired as a standard-of-care testing over the last 4 years from 20 clinical laboratories in the United States. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks, and adenovirus and the bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. The dataset can also be considered in an ecological framework; the viruses and bacteria detected by this test are parasites of a host (the human patient). Interestingly, the rate of pathogen codetections, on average 7.94% (28,741/362,101), matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic Trends preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers while still collecting much useful information about the bacterial and viral pathogens that they harbor. Test results are uploaded to the database within a few hours of completion compared with delays of up to 10 days for other diagnostic-based reporting systems. This work shows that the barriers to establishing epidemiology systems are no longer scientific and technical but rather administrative, involving questions of patient privacy and data ownership. We have demonstrated here that these barriers can be overcome. This first look at the resulting data stream suggests that Syndromic Trends will be able to provide high-resolution analysis of circulating respiratory pathogens and may aid in the detection of new outbreaks.",We hypothesized that such a system could aid in monitoring the seasonal occurrence of respiratory pathogens and may have advantages with regard to scope and ease of reporting compared with existing surveillance systems.,"['such_a_system', 'the_seasonal_occurrence', 'respiratory_pathogens', 'advantages', 'regard', 'scope', 'ease', 'existing_surveillance_systems']","['such a system', 'the seasonal occurrence', 'respiratory pathogens', 'advantages', 'regard', 'scope', 'ease', 'existing surveillance systems']",such a system,the seasonal occurrence,respiratory pathogens,advantages,regard,scope,ease,existing surveillance systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-α-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α.

Recent studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from the two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of paramyxovirus fusion proteins could be used as inhibitors of virus fusion. The mechanism underlying this activity is in accordance with that of class I virus fusion proteins, of which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus fusion proteins are members. For class I virus fusion proteins, the HR1 fragment binds to HR2 to form a six-helix bundle with three HR1 fragments forming the central coiled bundle surrounded by three coiled HR2 fragments in the post fusion conformational state (fusion core). It is hypothesized that the introduced exogenous HR1 or HR2 can compete against their endogenous counterparts, which results in fusion inhibition. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model, we designed several protein inhibitors, denoted HR212 as well asHR121 and 5-Helix, which could bind the HR1 or HR2 region of fusion protein, respectively. All the proteins were expressed and purified using a GST-fusion expression system in Escherichia coli. The HR212 or GST-HR212 protein, which binds the HR1 peptide in vitro, displayed inhibitory activity against NDV-mediated cell fusion, while the HR121 and 5-Helix proteins, which bind the HR2 peptide in vitro, inhibited virus fusion from the avirulent NDV strain when added before the cleavage of the fusion protein. These results showed that the designed HR212, HR121 or 5-Helix protein could serve as specific antiviral agents.

However, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations so other genes in the pathway could be potentially involved. IVIG is ineffective in mice lacking SIGN-R1, a related molecule to human DC-SIGN. Further, DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc, the component responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of IVIG. Thus, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN would also be involved in the pathway of IVIG response in Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients. FINDINGS: A case-control approach was performed to examine the differential distribution of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DC-SIGN promoter with IVIG-R among White (158 vs. 62), Asian (64 vs. 12) and Hispanic (55 vs. 20) KD patients. Distinct differences in allele frequency distributions of several variants in the DC-SIGN promoter were observed in the three ethnic groups. Further, Asians with the major allele “A” in rs2287886 were more likely (OR = 1.76, p = 0.04) to be IVIG non-responder, but this allele is a minor allele in other two ethnic groups, where the association was not apparent.

Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1. We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized hamsters. RESULTS: We amplified and characterized 14 different gp120s from primary subtype B isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins. However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E CONCLUSION: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.","Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1.","['Herein', 'a_cocktail', 'HIV-1_gp120_proteins', 'multiple_epitopes', 'the_breadth', 'immune_responses', 'HIV-1']","['Herein', 'a cocktail', 'HIV-1 gp120 proteins', 'multiple epitopes', 'the breadth', 'immune responses', 'HIV-1']",Herein,a cocktail,HIV-1 gp120 proteins,multiple epitopes,the breadth,immune responses,HIV-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, we have analyzed the results of molecular dynamics simulations where all possible conformational and aggregational space was systematically explored. Two main assumptions were considered; the first is that protein E contains one transmembrane α-helical domain, with its N- and C-termini located in opposite faces of the lipid bilayer. The second is that protein E forms the same type of transmembrane oligomer and with identical backbone structure in different coronaviruses. The models arising from the molecular dynamics simulations were tested for evolutionary conservation using 13 coronavirus protein E homologous sequences. It is extremely unlikely that if any of our assumptions were not correct we would find a persistent structure for all the sequences tested. We show that a low energy dimeric, trimeric and two pentameric models appear to be conserved through evolution, and are therefore likely to be present in vivo. In support of this, we have observed only dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric aggregates for the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E in SDS. The models obtained point to residues essential for protein E oligomerization in the life cycle of the SARS virus, specifically N15.

While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.","Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating.","['the_hypothesis', '(Sorex_araneus', 'large_numbers', 'offspring', 'the_one_breeding_season', 'their_short_life_span', 'forgo_investment', 'immunity_and_immune_system_maintenance', 'increased_longevity', 'further_opportunities', 'mating']","['the hypothesis', '(Sorex araneus', 'large numbers', 'offspring', 'the one breeding season', 'their short life span', 'forgo investment', 'immunity and immune system maintenance', 'increased longevity', 'further opportunities', 'mating']",the hypothesis,(Sorex araneus,large numbers,offspring,the one breeding season,their short life span,forgo investment,immunity and immune system maintenance,increased longevity,further opportunities,mating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of ‘protein homeostasis system’; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.","From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of ‘protein homeostasis system’; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system.","['our_findings', 'previous_experimental_and_clinical_studies', 'that_hyperactive_immune_cells', 'T_cells', 'the_acute_lung_injury', 'influenza_virus_infections', 'a_hypothesis', '‘protein_homeostasis_system', 'the_inducers', 'the_primary_immune_sites', 'the_innate_immune_system']","['our findings', 'previous experimental and clinical studies', 'that hyperactive immune cells', 'T cells', 'the acute lung injury', 'influenza virus infections', 'a hypothesis', '‘protein homeostasis system', 'the inducers', 'the primary immune sites', 'the innate immune system']",our findings,previous experimental and clinical studies,that hyperactive immune cells,T cells,the acute lung injury,influenza virus infections,a hypothesis,‘protein homeostasis system,the inducers,the primary immune sites,the innate immune system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two ferrets (16/group) received 0.5 mL intra-muscular injections of the Canadian-manufactured, commercially-available, non-adjuvanted, split 2008–09 Fluviral or PBS placebo on days 0 and 28. On day 49 all animals were challenged (Ch0) with A(H1N1)pdm09. Four ferrets per group were randomly selected for sacrifice at day 5 post-challenge (Ch+5) and the rest followed until Ch+14. Sera were tested for antibody to vaccine antigens and A(H1N1)pdm09 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), nucleoprotein-based ELISA and HA1-based microarray assays. Clinical characteristics and nasal virus titers were recorded pre-challenge then post-challenge until sacrifice when lung virus titers, cytokines and inflammatory scores were determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-naïve animals. Antibody rise to vaccine antigens was evident by ELISA and HA1-based microarray but not by HI or MN assays; virus challenge raised antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 by all assays in both groups. Beginning at Ch+2, vaccinated animals experienced greater loss of appetite and weight than placebo animals, reaching the greatest between-group difference in weight loss relative to baseline at Ch+5 (7.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.01).

So far, the structure determination of the SARS-CoV NP CTD in solution has been impeded by the poor quality of NMR spectra, especially for aromatic resonances. We have recently developed the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method to overcome the size problem of NMR structure determination by utilizing a protein exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically isotope-labeled amino acids. Here, we employed the SAIL method to determine the high-quality solution structure of the SARS-CoV NP CTD by NMR. The SAIL protein yielded less crowded and better resolved spectra than uniform 13C and 15N labeling, and enabled the homodimeric solution structure of this protein to be determined. The NMR structure is almost identical with the previously solved crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. Studies of the chemical shift perturbations caused by the binding of single-stranded DNA and mutational analyses have identified the disordered region at the N-termini as the prime site for nucleic acid binding. In addition, residues in the β-sheet region also showed significant perturbations. Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.","Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.","['Mapping', 'the_locations', 'these_residues', 'the_helical_model', 'the_crystal', 'these_two_regions', 'parts', 'the_interior_lining', 'the_positively_charged_helical_groove', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_helical_oligomer', 'solution']","['Mapping', 'the locations', 'these residues', 'the helical model', 'the crystal', 'these two regions', 'parts', 'the interior lining', 'the positively charged helical groove', 'the hypothesis', 'the helical oligomer', 'solution']",Mapping,the locations,these residues,the helical model,the crystal,these two regions,parts,the interior lining,the positively charged helical groove,the hypothesis,the helical oligomer,solution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 10–20% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia which contributes to considerable morbidity. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood. The present study investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and host human components. METHODOLOGY: Bioinformatic tools were used to identify peptides of CHIKV E1 exhibiting similarity to host components. Two peptides (A&B) were identified using several bioinformatic tools, synthesised and used to validate the results obtained in silico. An ELISA was designed to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples from CHIKV patients to these peptides. Further, experiments were conducted in a C57BL/6J experimental mouse model to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were indeed capable of inducing pathology. FINDINGS: The serum samples showed reactivity of varying degrees, indicating that these peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection. Further, these peptides when injected into C57BL/6J mice were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice, similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology in the skeletal muscles as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone.

The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","['The_tested_animals', 'transport', 'our_results', 'agreement', 'the_current_literature', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_prevalence', 'pathogens', 'BRD', 'an_increased_risk', 'pathogens']","['The tested animals', 'transport', 'our results', 'agreement', 'the current literature', 'the hypothesis', 'the prevalence', 'pathogens', 'BRD', 'an increased risk', 'pathogens']",The tested animals,transport,our results,agreement,the current literature,the hypothesis,the prevalence,pathogens,BRD,an increased risk,pathogens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) on the expression of AP-2 in breast cancer cells. Here, we provide evidence that TNF-α downregulates AP-2α and AP-2γ expression posttranscriptionally during TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Both a general caspase antagonist (zVADfmk) and a caspase 6-preferred antagonist (zVEIDfmk) inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis and AP-2α downregulation. In vivo tests showed that AP-2α was cleaved by caspases ahead of the DNA fragmentation phase of apoptosis. Recombinant caspase 6 cleaved AP-2α preferentially, although caspases 1 and 3 also cleaved it, albeit at 50-fold or higher concentrations. Activated caspase 6 was detected in TNF-α-treated cells, thus confirming its involvement in AP-2α cleavage. All three caspases cleaved AP-2α at asp(19) of the sequence asp-arg-his-asp (DRHD(19)). Mutating D(19) to A(19) abrogated AP-2α cleavage by all three caspases. TNF-α-induced cleavage of AP-2α in vivo led to AP-2α degradation and loss of DNA-binding activity, both of which were prevented by pretreatment with zVEIDfmk. AP-2α degradation but not cleavage was inhibited in vivo by PS-431 (a proteasome antagonist), suggesting that AP-2α is degraded subsequent to cleavage by caspase 6 or caspase 6-like enzymes. Cells transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged mutant AP-2α are resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, further demonstrating the link between caspase-mediated cleavage of AP-2α and apoptosis. This is the first report to demonstrate that degradation of AP-2α is a critical event in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Since the DRHD sequence in vertebrate AP-2 is widely conserved, its cleavage by caspases may represent an important mechanism for regulating cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.","(AP-2α) to apoptosis, leading us to hypothesize that AP-2α is a substrate for caspases.","['(AP-2α)_to_apoptosis', 'AP-2α', 'a_substrate', 'caspases']","['(AP-2α) to apoptosis', 'AP-2α', 'a substrate', 'caspases']",(AP-2α) to apoptosis,AP-2α,a substrate,caspases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One major contributor to the decline are pathogens, including several honey bee viruses. However, information is limited on the biology of bee viruses and molecular interactions with their hosts. An experimental protocol to test these systems was developed, using injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) into honey bee pupae reared ex-situ under laboratory conditions. The infected pupae developed pronounced but variable patterns of disease. Symptoms varied from complete cessation of development with no visual evidence of disease to rapid darkening of a part or the entire body. Considerable differences in IAPV titer dynamics were observed, suggesting significant variation in resistance to IAPV among and possibly within honey bee colonies. Thus, selective breeding for virus resistance should be possible. Gene expression analyses of three separate experiments suggest IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis of several fundamental cellular functions, including an up-regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These results provide first insights into the mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity.

We propose that for these viruses, too, membrane targeting via cholesterol conjugation may yield potent compounds. Here we compare the activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and show that although the unconjugated peptides are inactive, the cholesterol-conjugated compounds are effective inhibitors of infectivity and membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the cholesterol moiety, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane, allows the peptides to follow the virus to the intracellular site of fusion. The cholesterol-conjugated peptides trap HA in a transient intermediate state after fusion is triggered but before completion of the refolding steps that drive the merging of the viral and cellular membranes. These results provide proof of concept for an antiviral strategy that is applicable to intracellularly fusing viruses, including known and emerging viral pathogens.","We hypothesize that the cholesterol moiety, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane, allows the peptides to follow the virus to the intracellular site of fusion.","['the_target_cell_membrane', 'the_peptides', 'the_virus', 'the_intracellular_site', 'fusion']","['the target cell membrane', 'the peptides', 'the virus', 'the intracellular site', 'fusion']",the target cell membrane,the peptides,the virus,the intracellular site,fusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that herds can remain free from these infections for several years also in high prevalence areas. Organically managed (OM) dairy herds have been shown to have lower seroprevalence of both viruses compared to conventionally managed (CM) herds. The objective of this study was to challenge the hypothesis of a lower occurrence of BRSV and BoCV in OM compared to CM dairy herds. In November 2011, May 2012 and May 2013 milk samples from four homebred primiparous cows were collected in 75 to 65 OM and 69 to 62 CM herds. The antibody status regarding BRSV and BoCV was analysed with commercial indirect ELISAs. Herds were classified as positive if at least one individual sample was positive. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive herds ranged from 73.4% to 82.3% for BRSV and from 76.8% to 85.3% for BoCV among OM and CM herds, over the three sampling occasions. There was no statistically significant difference between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion. The incidence risk of newly infected herds did not differ statistically between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion, neither for BRSV nor for BoCV. The incidence of herds turning sero-negative between samplings corresponded to the incidence of newly infected. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were also sampled in the herds and analysed. Several herds were negative on individual samples but positive in BTM. Herd-level data on production, health and reproduction were retrieved from VÄXA Sweden and the study herds were representative of the source population. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in prevalence of or incidence risk for BRSV or BoCV between Swedish OM and CM herds. Because the incidence of herds becoming seropositive was balanced by herds becoming seronegative it should be possible to lower the prevalence of these two infections among Swedish dairy cattle herds if biosecurity is improved.

Among various cytokines implicated in liver ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, type I IFNs have been described recently as playing an essential role in its pathogenesis. Moreover, type I IFNs have been shown to up-regulate hepatocyte expression of IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a key transcription factor that regulates apoptosis and induces liver damage after I/R. Our aim was to ascertain the capacity of IFN-α released by liver pDC to induce liver damage through hepatic IRF-1 up-regulation after I/R injury. Our findings show that liver pDC mature and produce IFN-α in response to liver I/R. Liver pDC isolated after I/R induced elevated levels of IRF-1 production by hepatocytes compared with liver pDC isolated from sham-operated mice. Notably, hepatic IRF-1 expression was reduced significantly by neutralizing IFN-α. In vivo, IFN-α neutralization protected the liver from I/R injury by reducing hepatocyte apoptosis. This was associated with impaired expression of IRF-1 and pro-apoptotic molecules such as Fas ligand, its receptor (Fas) and death receptor 5 which are regulated by IRF-1. Furthermore, pDC-depleted mice failed to up-regulate hepatic IFN-α and displayed less liver injury associated with reduced levels of hepatic IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and hepatocyte apoptosis after I/R compared with controls.

Recent phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that this pathogenic fungus arrived in the PNW approximately 7 to 9 decades ago.

In 1964, a tsunami flooded local coastal regions, transporting C. gattii to land. The occurrence of cryptococcosis in animals and humans 3 decades later suggests that adaptation to local environs took time, possibly requiring an increase in virulence and further dispersal.

Rearrangements of the cytoskeleton in producer and target cells are required for proper targeting of viral and cellular components during synapse formation, yet little is known about how these processes are regulated, particularly within the producer cell. Since ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins connect F-actin with integral and peripheral membrane proteins, are incorporated into virions, and interact with cellular components of the virological presynapse, we hypothesized that they play roles during the late stage of HIV-1 replication. Here we document that phosphorylated (i.e., active) ezrin specifically accumulates at the HIV-1 presynapse in T cell lines and primary CD4(+) lymphocytes. To investigate whether ezrin supports virus transmission, we sought to ablate ezrin expression in producer cells. While cells did not tolerate a complete knockdown of ezrin, even a modest reduction of ezrin expression (∼50%) in HIV-1-producing cells led to the release of particles with impaired infectivity. Further, when cocultured with uninfected target cells, ezrin-knockdown producer cells displayed reduced accumulation of the tetraspanin CD81 at the synapse and fused more readily with target cells, thus forming syncytia. Such an outcome likely is not optimal for virus dissemination, as evidenced by the fact that, in vivo, only relatively few infected cells form syncytia. Thus, ezrin likely helps secure efficient virus spread not only by enhancing virion infectivity but also by preventing excessive membrane fusion at the virological synapse. IMPORTANCE While viruses, in principal, can propagate through successions of syncytia, HIV-1-infected cells in the majority of cases do not fuse with potential target cells during viral transmission. This mode of spread is coresponsible for key features of HIV-1 pathogenesis, including killing of bystander cells and establishment of latently infected T lymphocytes. Here we identify the ERM protein family member ezrin as a cellular factor that contributes to the inhibition of cell-cell fusion and thus to suppressing excessive syncytium formation. Our analyses further suggest that ezrin, which connects integral membrane proteins with actin, functions in concert with CD81, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins. Additional evidence, documented here and elsewhere, suggests that ezrin and CD81 cooperate to prevent cytoskeleton rearrangements that need to take place during the fusion of cellular membranes.",", we hypothesized that they play roles during the late stage of HIV-1 replication.","['roles', 'the_late_stage', 'HIV-1_replication']","['roles', 'the late stage', 'HIV-1 replication']",roles,the late stage,HIV-1 replication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Establishment of chronic infection by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis depends on its subversion of host immune responses. This includes blocking the ability of infected macrophages to be activated by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) for clearance of this intracellular pathogen. To define the mechanism by which M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis subverts this critical host cell function, patterns of signal transduction to IFN-γ stimulation of uninfected and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected bovine monocytes were determined through bovine-specific peptide arrays for kinome analysis. Pathway analysis of the kinome data indicated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, a hallmark of IFN-γ signaling, in uninfected monocytes. In contrast, IFN-γ stimulation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes failed to induce patterns of peptide phosphorylation consistent with JAK-STAT activation. The inability of IFN-γ to induce differential phosphorylation of peptides corresponding to early JAK-STAT intermediates in infected monocytes indicates that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis blocks responsiveness at, or near, the IFN-γ receptor. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased expression of negative regulators of the IFN-γ receptors SOCS1 and SOCS3 as well as decreased expression of IFN-γ receptor chains 1 and 2 is observed in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes. These patterns of expression are functionally consistent with the kinome data and offer a mechanistic explanation for this critical M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis behavior.

Dalziel, P.W. Lampert, P. J. Talbot, and M. J. Buchmeier, J. Virol. 59:463-471, 1986) were found to harbor large deletions in both mRNA 3 and its protein product, the 180-kilodalton viron spike (S) glycoprotein. By using antipeptide antibodies directed against selected portions of the chain, deletions were mapped to the middle of the amino-terminal S1 fragment, one of the two posttranslational cleavage products of S, and involved omission of 15 kilodaltons of protein. Deletion mutants could be selected only after multiple passage of virus through cultured cell lines; minimally passaged MHV-4 stocks contained putative point mutants selectable by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but no deletions.

However, there are reports that infants who receive antenatal glucocorticoids exhibit higher systolic blood pressure in their early adolescent years. We have developed an experimental model of programming whereby the offspring of pregnant sheep administered clinically relevant doses of betamethasone exhibit elevated blood pressure. We tested the hypothesis as to whether alterations in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, and neprilysin in serum, urine, and proximal tubules are associated with this increase in mean arterial pressure. Male sheep were administered betamethasone (2 doses of 0.17 mg/kg, 24 hours apart) or vehicle at the 80th day of gestation and delivered at term. Sheep were instrumented at adulthood (1.8 years) for direct conscious recording of mean arterial pressure. Serum and urine were collected and proximal tubules isolated from the renal cortex. Betamethasone-treated animals had elevated mean arterial pressure (97±3 versus 83±2 mm Hg; P<0.05) and a 25% increase in serum ACE activity (48.4±7.0 versus 36.0±2.7 fmol/mL per minute) but a 40% reduction in serum ACE2 activity (18.8±1.2 versus 31.4±4.4 fmol/mL per minute). In isolated proximal tubules, ACE2 activity and expression were 50% lower in the treated sheep with no significant change in ACE or neprilysin activities.

While producing a global cellular effect, proteasome inhibitors have not triggered the catastrophe articulated initially in terms such as “buildup of cellular garbage”. Proteasome inhibitors, in fact, do have a therapeutic window, although in the case of the prototype bortezomib it is small owing to peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression and, as recently reported, cardiotoxicity [1]. Currently, several second-generation molecules are undergoing clinical evaluation to increase this window. An alternative strategy is to target ubiquitin pathway enzymes acting at non-proteasomal sites—E1, E2, and E3, associated with ubiquitin conjugation, and deubiquitylating enzymes (“DUBs”)—that act locally on selected targets rather than on the whole cell. Inhibitors (or activators, in some cases) of these enzymes should be developable as selective antitumor agents with toxicity profiles superior to that of bortezomib. Various therapeutic hypotheses follow from known cellular mechanisms of these target enzymes; most hypotheses relate to cancer, reminiscent of the FDA-approved protein kinase inhibitors now marketed. Since ubiquitin tagging controls the cellular content, activity, or compartmentation of proteins associated with disease, inhibitors or activators of ubiquitin conjugation or deconjugation are predicted to have an impact on disease. For practical and empirical reasons, inhibitors of ubiquitin pathway enzymes have been the favored therapeutic avenue. In approximately the time that has elapsed since the approval of bortezomib in 2003, there has been some progress in developing potential anticancer drugs that target various ubiquitin pathway enzymes. An E1 inhibitor and inhibitors of E3 are now in clinical trial, with some objective responses reported. Appropriate assays and/or rational design may uncover improved inhibitors of these enzymes, as well as E2 and DUBs, for further development. Presently, it should become clear whether one or both of the two general strategies for ubiquitin-based drug discovery will lead to truly superior new medicines for cancer and other diseases.

This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl(-/-) mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl(+/+) mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctsl(+/+) mice, although Ctsl(+/+) mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl(-/-) mice had profound deficits in CD4+ lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A.","The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL.","['The_present_study tested the_hypothesis', 'CTSL', 'mice', 'serious_consequences', 'infection', 'the_orthomyxovirus_influenza_A', 'host-supplied_proteases', 'CTSL']","['The present study tested the hypothesis', 'CTSL', 'mice', 'serious consequences', 'infection', 'the orthomyxovirus influenza A', 'host-supplied proteases', 'CTSL']",The present study tested the hypothesis,CTSL,mice,serious consequences,infection,the orthomyxovirus influenza A,host-supplied proteases,CTSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.","Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet.","['intense_research', 'the_main_bat-maintenance_hypothesis']","['intense research', 'the main bat-maintenance hypothesis']",intense research,the main bat-maintenance hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using this system, the duration of a primary transcription initiation activity which transcribes subgenomic-size RNAs from the genomic-size RNA template in MHV-infected cells was examined. Efficient DI genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis was observed when the DI RNA was transfected at 1, 3, 3.5, 5, and 6 h postinfection, indicating that all activities which are necessary for MHV RNA synthesis are present continuously during the first 6 h of infection. The effect of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis on DI genomic RNA replication was then examined. Replication efficiency of the DI genomic RNA which synthesized the subgenomic RNA was approximately 70% lower than that of DI genomic RNA which did not synthesize the subgenomic DI RNA in MHV-infected cells. Cotransfection of two different-size DI RNAs demonstrated that replication of the larger DI RNA was strongly inhibited by replication of the smaller genomic DI RNA. Cotransfection of two DI RNA species of the same length into MHV-infected cells demonstrated that reduced replication of the genomic DI RNA which synthesizes the subgenomic RNA did not affect the replication of cotransfected DI RNA, demonstrating that the reduction in DI genomic RNA replication works only in cis, not in trans. Therefore, the previously proposed hypothesis that coronavirus, subgenomic RNA synthesis may inhibit the replication of genomic RNA by competing for a limited amount of virus-derived factors seems unlikely.

Purine metabolite DAMPs, including extracellular ATP and adenosine, inhibit chlamydial development in a species-specific manner. Viral co-infection has been shown to reversibly abrogate Chlamydia inclusion development, suggesting persistence/chlamydial stress.

In the absence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post or at 14 hours post infection reduced inclusion size; however, the effect was less robust upon 14 hours post infection exposure. Additionally, upon exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent infectivity were reduced in both Chlamydia species. These effects were reversible, and C. pecorum exhibited more pronounced recovery from DAMP exposure. Aberrant bodies, typical in virus-induced chlamydial persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. In the presence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection reduced inclusion size, but only variably modulated chlamydial infectivity.

The screen revealed a high-score interaction with cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle early G(1) phase. M2-cyclin D3 interaction was validated through GST pull-down and recapitulated in influenza A/WSN/33-infected cells. Knockdown of Ccnd3 by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced virus progeny titers in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, the increase in virus production was due to cyclin D3 deficiency per se and not merely a consequence of cell cycle deregulation. A combined knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1, which rescued cell cycle progression into S phase, failed to normalize virus production. Infection by influenza A virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2 with M1, which is essential for proper assembly of progeny virions, lending further support to its role as a putative restriction factor. Our study describes the identification and characterization of cyclin D3 as a novel interactor of influenza A virus M2 protein.

Predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including the impact of HRV species and types are poorly understood. Objectives This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV infections among HM patients. Study design From April 2012–March 2013, HRV-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic HM patients were molecularly characterized by analysis of partial viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 gene sequence. HRV LRTI risk-factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results One hundred and ten HM patients presented with HRV URTI (n =78) and HRV LRTI (n =32). Hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0–9.2; p =0.05) was independently associated with LRTI, but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients with URTI versus LRTI. Detection of bacterial co-pathogens was common in LRTI cases (25%). Among 92 typeable respiratory specimens, there were 58 (64%) HRV-As, 12 (13%) HRV-Bs, and 21 (23%) HRV-Cs, and one Enterovirus 68. LRTI rates among HRV-A (29%), HRV-B (17%), and HRV-C (29%) were similar. HRV-A infections occurred year-round while HRV-B and HRV-C infections clustered in the late fall and winter. Conclusions HRVs are associated with LRTI in HM patients. Illness severity is not attributable to specific HRV species or types. The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.","The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.","['The_frequent_detection', 'bacterial_co-pathogens', 'HRV_LRTIs', 'the_hypothesis', 'HRVs', 'bacterial_superinfection', 'the_lower_airways', 'other_community-acquired_respiratory_viruses']","['The frequent detection', 'bacterial co-pathogens', 'HRV LRTIs', 'the hypothesis', 'HRVs', 'bacterial superinfection', 'the lower airways', 'other community-acquired respiratory viruses']",The frequent detection,bacterial co-pathogens,HRV LRTIs,the hypothesis,HRVs,bacterial superinfection,the lower airways,other community-acquired respiratory viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined by the means of NBT reduction and changes in cell conformation. And the variations of NOS activity in shrimps after challenge with WSSV intramuscularly were evaluated through the analysis of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate (both as NO derivates) concentrations. The result showed that NOS activity in the haemocytes of F. chinensis increased slightly from 0 to 12h postchallenge, indicated by the variations of l-citrulline (from 11.15±0.10 to 12.08±0.64μM) and total nitrite/nitrate concentrations (from 10.45±0.65 to 12.67±0.52μM). Then it decreased sharply till the end of the experiment (84h postchallenge), the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 84h were 1.58±0.24 and 2.69±0.70μM, respectively. The LPS-stimulated NOS activity kept constant during the experiment. However, in M. japonicus, the NOS activity kept increasing during the first 72h postchallenge, the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate increased from 7.82±0.77 at 0h to 10.79±0.50μM at 72h, and from 8.98±0.43 at 0h to 11.20±0.37μM at 72h, respectively. Then it decreased till the end of the experiment (216h postchallenge), and the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 216h were 5.66±0.27 and 4.68±0.16μM, respectively. More importantly, an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity was observed in M. japonicus at 48h postchallenge, which was about 4 times higher than that in the control group of health shrimps. In correspondence with the difference of NOS activity between the two species of shrimps, the cumulative mortalities of the shrimps were also different. All shrimps of F. chinensis in the mortality experiment died in 66h, much more quickly than M. japonicus, whose accumulative mortality reached 100% after 240h.

In 2005, 13 PMWS cases were submitted to the Quebec provincial diagnostic laboratory and PCV-2 was the only virus that could be found consistently by PCR in all 13 samples. The PCR detection results obtained for other viruses revealed the following: 61.5% were positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 30.8% for swine influenza virus, 15.4% for porcine parvovirus, 69.2% for swine torque teno virus (swTTV), 38.5% for swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) and 84.6% for Mycoplasma hyorhinis; transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus (TGEV/PRCV) was not detected.

During the early stages of the HP-PRRSV infection, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines are noted in the host peripheral blood, which are accompanied by severe lesions in the lungs and immune system organs; these are considered as the greatest contributors to the overall disease burden. We hypothesized that the anti-PRRSV response in piglets might be mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which led to a decrease in the psycho-neuroendocrinological manifestation of HP-PRRSV etiology via immune response regulation. RESULTS: We investigated the regulation of the HPA axis in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets that were treated with 1 mg/kg body weight (b. w.)/day mifepristone (RU486) or 2 mg/kg b.w./day dexamethasone (DEX). Both RU486 and DEX enhanced the disease status of the piglets infected by the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain, resulting in high mortality and more severe pathological changes in the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: HP-PRRSV infection activates the HPA axis, and artificial regulation of the immune-endocrine system enhances disease severity in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets. Thus, DEX and RU486 should be avoided in the clinical treatment of HP-PRRS.

Mutations in surfactant protein C (SP-C) induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in AECs and cause lung fibrosis. This study tested the hypothesis that ER stress-induced apoptosis of AECs might also be regulated by the autocrine ANGII/ANG1–7 system of AECs. ER stress was induced in A549 cells or primary cultures of human AECs with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S. ER stress activated the ANGII-generating enzyme cathepsin D and simultaneously decreased the ANGII-degrading enzyme ACE-2, which normally generates the antiapoptotic peptide ANG1–7. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of ADAM17/TACE, significantly reduced both the activation of cathepsin D and the loss of ACE-2. Apoptosis of AECs induced by ER stress was measured by assays of mitochondrial function, JNK activation, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptosis induced by either MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS mutant G100S was significantly inhibited by the ANG receptor blocker saralasin and was completely abrogated by ANG1–7. Inhibition by ANG1–7 was blocked by the specific mas antagonist A779. These data show that ER stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by the autocrine ANGII/ANG1–7 system in human AECs and demonstrate effective blockade of SP-C mutation-induced apoptosis by ANG1–7.

Within 24 h of hospital admission, a total of 922 patients aged ≥60 years were interviewed for symptoms of ongoing respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic patients were swabbed for oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal presence of viral pathogens immediately by members of the study group. During a 2-month period, non-symptomatic volunteers among interviewed patients were swabbed as well (controls). Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with real-time PCR for nine common respiratory viruses.

The patients were allocated to three cohorts: (1) symptomatic and PCR-positive (S/PCR+), (2) symptomatic and PCR-negative (S/PCR−), or (3) non-symptomatic and PCR-negative (control). There were no non-symptomatic patients with a positive PCR result. A non-significant difference in the frequency of empiric antibiotic administration was found when comparing the S/PCR+ to the S/PCR− cohort; 16/19 (84 %) vs. 99/128 (77 %) (χ(2) = 0.49).

Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified.

Here, we evaluated whether the sequence similarity of various antigens to the microbiota dampens or increases immunogenicity of T cell epitopes. Sets of epitopes and control sequences derived from 38 antigenic categories (infectious pathogens, allergens, autoantigens) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Their similarity to microbiome sequences was calculated using the BLOSUM62 matrix. We found that sequence similarity was associated with either dampened (tolerogenic; e.g. most allergens) or increased (inflammatory; e.g. Dengue and West Nile viruses) likelihood of a peptide being immunogenic as a function of epitope source category. Ten-fold cross-validation and validation using sets of manually curated epitopes and non-epitopes derived from allergens were used to confirm these initial observations. Furthermore, the genus from which the microbiome homologous sequences were derived influenced whether a tolerogenic versus inflammatory modulatory effect was observed, with Fusobacterium most associated with inflammatory influences and Bacteroides most associated with tolerogenic influences. We validated these effects using PBMCs stimulated with various sets of microbiome peptides. “Tolerogenic” microbiome peptides elicited IL-10 production, “inflammatory” peptides elicited mixed IL-10/IFNγ production, while microbiome epitopes homologous to self were completely unreactive for both cytokines. We also tested the sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes to specific microbiome sequences derived from households of cockroach allergic individuals and non-allergic controls. Microbiomes from cockroach allergic households were less likely to contain sequences homologous to previously defined cockroach allergens. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes. Taken together this study suggests that microbiome sequence similarity influences immune reactivity to homologous epitopes encoded by pathogens, allergens and auto-antigens.","These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes.","['These_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'microbiome_sequences', 'T_cells', 'allergen_epitopes', 'lack', 'these_sequences', 'increased_likelihood', 'T_cell_reactivity', 'the_cockroach_epitopes']","['These results', 'the hypothesis', 'microbiome sequences', 'T cells', 'allergen epitopes', 'lack', 'these sequences', 'increased likelihood', 'T cell reactivity', 'the cockroach epitopes']",These results,the hypothesis,microbiome sequences,T cells,allergen epitopes,lack,these sequences,increased likelihood,T cell reactivity,the cockroach epitopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1).

Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6-vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6-vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.",We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period.,"['immaturity', 'the_immune_system', 'induction', 'tolerance', 'rAAV6']","['immaturity', 'the immune system', 'induction', 'tolerance', 'rAAV6']",immaturity,the immune system,induction,tolerance,rAAV6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HHV-6 variant B causes the common childhood disease exhanthem subitum, and although the pathologic characteristics for HHV-6 variant A are less well defined, HHV-6A has been suggested to be more neurotropic. We studied the effect of both HHV-6 variants in an oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3.13). Infection of M03.13 was monitored by cytopathic effect (CPE), quantitative TaqMan PCR for viral DNA in cells and supernatant, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) to detect viral protein expression. HHV-6A infection induced significantly more CPE than infection with HHV-6B. HHV-6B induced an abortive infection associated with a decrease of the initial viral DNA load over time, early RNA expression, and no expression of viral antigen. In contrast, infection with HHV-6A DNA persisted in cells for at least 62 days. During the acute phase of infection with HHV-6A, intracellular and extracellular viral load increased and cells expressed the viral protein IE-2 and gp116/54/64.

To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC.

Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner.

Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the ‘riskiest’ contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect. In most situations, increasing overall mutation probability increases the risk of emergence; however, notable exceptions arise when deleterious mutations are available.",These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors.,"['These_generalizations', 'novel_predictions', 'the_impact', 'hypothesized_risk_factors']","['These generalizations', 'novel predictions', 'the impact', 'hypothesized risk factors']",These generalizations,novel predictions,the impact,hypothesized risk factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with β-lactam antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and β-lactam compared with treatment with β-lactam antibiotics only. The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22). RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia. LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses. Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients.

Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker “retinoic acid” in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5′–AGGTCA–3′) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required). The numbers of RARE sequence repeats appeared to match with the virulence of screened positive viruses. Although, bioinformatic evidence and embryological features are in favor of our hypothesis, additional studies including animal models are warranted to validate our proposition.

Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (IU) (P = 0.013) HIV-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (IP) (P = 0.025) HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors. The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU (P = 0.045 and P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (P = 0.025, for int2-180A) HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission.","Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1.","['the_C-type_lectin_receptor', 'CD209L or liver / lymph node', 'specific_ICAM-grabbing_non-integrin', '( L - SIGN', 'pathogens', 'HIV-1', 'the_maternal-fetal_interface', 'MTCT', 'HIV-1']","['the C-type lectin receptor', 'CD209L or liver / lymph node', 'specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin', '( L - SIGN', 'pathogens', 'HIV-1', 'the maternal-fetal interface', 'MTCT', 'HIV-1']",the C-type lectin receptor,CD209L or liver / lymph node,specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin,( L - SIGN,pathogens,HIV-1,the maternal-fetal interface,MTCT,HIV-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All F(1) macrophages and some back-cross cell cultures were susceptible. The degeneration of F(1) and back-cross macrophages obtained either from adult mouse peritoneal exudate or newborn mouse liver, occurred more slowly than PRI macrophages. Segregation of susceptibility occurred in the first back-cross generation. Tests of three back-cross generations from susceptible mice yielded about one-quarter of the mice shown to be susceptible either by direct test or test of their macrophages. A clear correlation between susceptibility in vivo and in vitro was established both in the test of the percentage segregation and in tests of individual back-cross mice.

Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the non-structural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses.

A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNV’s greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features – impressive in themselves – attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.Significance StatementRNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication.

At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r > 0.6; p < 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p < 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts.

The NS2(H126R) mutant is attenuated in liver replication due to loss of phosphodiesterase activity, which the wild-type (WT) virus uses to block the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L (RNase L) antiviral pathway. The activation of RNase L by NS2(H126R) is cell type dependent and correlates with high basal expression levels of OAS, as found in myeloid cells. We tested the hypothesis that the resident liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (KC), represent the cell type most likely to restrict NS2(H126R) and prevent hepatitis. As found previously, A59 and NS2(H126R) replicate similarly in hepatocytes and neither activates RNase L, as assessed by an rRNA degradation assay. In contrast, in KC, A59 exhibited a 100-fold-higher titer than NS2(H126R) and NS2(H126R) induced rRNA degradation. Interestingly, in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), the cells that form a barrier between blood and liver parenchymal cells, NS2(H126R) activates RNase L, which limits viral replication. Similar growth kinetics were observed for the two viruses in KC and LSEC from RNase L(−/−) mice, demonstrating that both use RNase L to limit NS2(H126R) replication. Depletion of KC by gadolinium(III) chloride or of LSEC by cyclophosphamide partially restores liver replication of NS2(H126R), leading to hepatitis. Thus, during mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, hepatitis, which damages the parenchyma, is prevented by RNase L activity in both KC and LSEC but not in hepatocytes. This may be explained by the undetectable levels of RNase L as well as by the OASs expressed in hepatocytes. IMPORTANCE Mouse hepatitis virus infection of mice provides a useful tool for studying virus-host interactions during hepatitis development. The NS2(H126R) mutant is attenuated in liver replication due to loss of phosphodiesterase activity, by which the wild-type virus blocks the potent OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway. RNase L activation by NS2(H126R) is cell type dependent and correlates with high basal expression levels of OAS, as found in myeloid cells. We showed that the hepatocytes that comprise the liver parenchyma do not activate RNase L when infected with NS2(H126R) or restrict replication. However, both Kupffer cells (KC) (i.e., the liver-resident macrophages) and the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) which line the sinusoids activate RNase L in response to NS2(H126R). These data suggest that KC and LSEC prevent viral spread into the parenchyma, preventing hepatitis. Furthermore, hepatocytes express undetectable levels of OASs and RNase L, which likely explains the lack of RNase L activation during NS2(H126R) infection.","We tested the hypothesis that the resident liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (KC), represent the cell type most likely to restrict NS2(H126R) and prevent hepatitis.","['the_hypothesis', 'the_resident_liver macrophages', 'Kupffer_cells', 'KC', 'NS2(H126R', 'hepatitis']","['the hypothesis', 'the resident liver macrophages', 'Kupffer cells', 'KC', 'NS2(H126R', 'hepatitis']",the hypothesis,the resident liver macrophages,Kupffer cells,KC,NS2(H126R,hepatitis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CoVs encode a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion.

Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems.

The emergence of these agents is heavily associated with zonotic animal hosts, as well as migratory pathways of infected bird vectors. The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases. Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence. We suggest that Cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia, could be a) a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and, b) a source of zoonoses through infection of the ‘target’ animal (including humans). One example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsRNA from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts, as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsRNA viral-like particles. The importance of such a surrogate relationship is discussed and its implications for human and animal health highlighted.",Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence.,"['Our_hypothesis', 'such_emerging_viruses', 'a_virus-parasite_surrogate_relationship', 'viral_persistence']","['Our hypothesis', 'such emerging viruses', 'a virus-parasite surrogate relationship', 'viral persistence']",Our hypothesis,such emerging viruses,a virus-parasite surrogate relationship,viral persistence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 – December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N = 1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N = 446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature ((ο)C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. RESULTS: Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio = 1.27; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04–1.56) and humidity (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10–1.65) were associated with increased cases 8–10 days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01–1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5–6 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.","It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen.","['primary_cases', 'MERS', 'the_opposite_relationship']","['primary cases', 'MERS', 'the opposite relationship']",primary cases,MERS,the opposite relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210–230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-β promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6–30, 31–55, 56–80, 81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230, 231–248 or 249–265 lack functions of IFN–β mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR.

Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-β suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain.

Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future.","Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission?","['the_original_evidence', 'airborne_transmission', 'an_alternative_hypothesis', 'fomite_transmission']","['the original evidence', 'airborne transmission', 'an alternative hypothesis', 'fomite transmission']",the original evidence,airborne transmission,an alternative hypothesis,fomite transmission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three PHEICs suggest that deferred global mobilization is a greater source of delay than is poor surveillance capacity. These case study outbreaks support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for novel diseases when outbreaks do not coincide with holidays and when US citizens are infected. They do not support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for more severe outbreaks or those that threaten larger numbers of people.

Interactions between co-infecting parasites include resource competition, direct competition and immune-mediated interactions and each are likely to alter the dynamics of single parasites. We posit that co-infection is a driver of variation in parasite establishment and growth, ultimately altering the production of parasite transmission stages. To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus, the respiratory bacterial pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica lux(+) or co-infected with both parasites. To follow co-infection simultaneously, self-bioluminescent bacteria were used to quantify infection in vivo and in real-time, while helminth egg production was monitored in real-time using faecal samples. Co-infection resulted in high bacterial loads early in the infection (within the first 5 days) that could cause host mortality. Co-infection also produced helminth ‘super-shedders’; individuals that chronically shed the helminth eggs in larger than average numbers. Our study shows that co-infection may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the often-observed high variance in parasite load and shedding rates, and should thus be taken into consideration for disease management and control. Further, using self-bioluminescent bacterial reporters allowed quantification of the progression of infection within the whole animal of the same individuals at a fine temporal scale (daily) and significantly reduced the number of animals used (by 85%) compared with experiments that do not use in vivo techniques. Thus, we present bioluminescent imaging as a novel, non-invasive tool offering great potential to be taken forward into other applications of infectious disease ecology.","To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth","['three_different_treatment_groups', 'laboratory_mice', 'the_gastrointestinal_helminth']","['three different treatment groups', 'laboratory mice', 'the gastrointestinal helminth']",three different treatment groups,laboratory mice,the gastrointestinal helminth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can affect all age groups of birds. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors that have a key role in immune response and defense against various infections.The TLRs are essential for initiation of innate immune responses and in the development of adaptive immune responses. An in ovo model was employed to study the antiviral activity of TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN) on replication of IBV. It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Further, the mechanism involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral response in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of ECEs was investigated. The ECEs of 9–11 days old were treated with different doses (high, intermediate and low) of TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-21 (CpG ODN) ligands. In addition, to know the timing of TLR ligand treatment, six time intervals were analyzed viz. 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection, time of infection (co-administration of TLR ligands and avian IBV) and 12 and 24 h post-IBV infection. For studying the relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, iNOS and OAS) in CAM, TLR ligands were administered through intra-allantoicroute and CAM were collected at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment. The results demonstrated that intermediate dose of all the three TLR ligands significantly reduced virus titers and used in the present study. However, the LPS reduced virus titer pre- and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced only pre-IBV infection. Further analysis showed that TLR ligands induced IFN-γ, IL-1β and IFN stimulated genes viz. iNOS and OAS genes in CAM. The present study pointed towards the novel opportunities for rational design of LPS as immuno-stimulatory agent in chickens with reference to IBV. It may be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance against viral infection in neonatal chicken and may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines.",It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs).,"['optimum_dose', 'specific_timing', 'TLR_ligands', 'viral_load', 'IBV', 'specific_pathogen_free_(SPF)_embryonated_chicken_eggs', 'ECEs']","['optimum dose', 'specific timing', 'TLR ligands', 'viral load', 'IBV', 'specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs', 'ECEs']",optimum dose,specific timing,TLR ligands,viral load,IBV,specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs,ECEs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat.

Neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi. Leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats, except for the CD8(+) regulatory T cells.

Among them, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that chronically infects over 90% of the adult population, with over 200,000 cases of cancer and 150,000 cancer-related deaths attributed to it yearly. Acute EBV infection can present as infectious mononucleosis, and lead to the future onset of multiple cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Many of these cancers express latent viral genes, including Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2). Previous attempts to create potent immunogens against EBV have been reported but generated mixed success. We designed novel Synthetic Consensus (SynCon) DNA vaccines against EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 to improve on the immune potency targeting important antigens expressed in latently infected cells. These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers. We optimized the genetic sequences for these three antigens, studied them for expression, and examined their immune profiles in vivo. We observed that these immunogens generated unique profiles based on which antigen was delivered as the vaccine target. EBNA1vax and LMP2Avax generated the most robust T cell immunity. Interestingly, LMP1vax was a very weak immunogen, generating very low levels of CD8 T cell immunity both as a standalone vaccine and as part of a trivalent vaccine cocktail. LMP2Avax was able to drive immunity that impacted EBV-antigen-positive tumor growth.

DESIGN: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. SETTING: A network of teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100<PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤200) and severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200<PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤300) ARDS and non-ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)>300). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Group severity and hospital mortality. RESULTS: At ARDS onset, 173 patients had a PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100 but only 38.7% met criteria for severe ARDS at 24 h under SVS. When assessed under SVS, 61.3% of patients with severe ARDS were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS, while lung severity and hospital mortality changed markedly with every PaO(2)/FiO(2) category (p<0.000001). Our model of risk stratification outperformed the stratification using baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) and non-standardised PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 24 h, when analysed by the predictive receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: area under the ROC curve for stratification at baseline was 0.583 (95% CI 0.525 to 0.636), 0.605 (95% CI 0.552 to 0.658) at 24 h without SVS and 0.693 (95% CI 0.645 to 0.742) at 24 h under SVS (p<0.000001).

However, the etiology of most autoimmune diseases remains unknown. Although genetic linkage studies support a critical underlying role for genetics, the geographic distribution of these disorders as well as the low concordance rates in monozygotic twins suggest that a combination of other factors including environmental ones are involved. Virus infection is a primary factor that has been implicated in the initiation of autoimmune disease. Infection triggers a robust and usually well-coordinated immune response that is critical for viral clearance. However, in some instances, immune regulatory mechanisms may falter, culminating in the breakdown of self-tolerance, resulting in immune-mediated attack directed against both viral and self-antigens. Traditionally, cross-reactive T-cell recognition, known as molecular mimicry, as well as bystander T-cell activation, culminating in epitope spreading, have been the predominant mechanisms elucidated through which infection may culminate in an T-cell-mediated autoimmune response.

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h postpartum, with and without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to treatments: colostrum suckled (S, n=8); S plus fat supplement (SF, n=5); bottle-fed milk replacer (B, n=8); or B plus fat supplement (BF, n=7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs were taken with a cytology brush, immersed in ultrapure water to burst cells, and lipids extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts and milk collected from sows at 24 h were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids highly distinguished [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9] between S and B gilts, including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbon and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE(34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r> 0.6;p< 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids more abundant in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum, with 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p< 0.001), respectively, of B versus S gilts. Findings support that vaginal swabs can be used to noninvasively study effects of perinatal nutrition on tissue composition.Summary sentenceVaginal swab lipidome profiles at 48 h reflect the fat composition of neonatal diet during first two days postnatal.",AbstractWe hypothesized that postnatal development of the vagina is impacted by early nutritional environment.,"['AbstractWe', 'postnatal_development', 'the_vagina']","['AbstractWe', 'postnatal development', 'the vagina']",AbstractWe,postnatal development,the vagina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, the adaptive immune response to PRRS virus (PRRSV) is weak, which results in delayed elimination of virus from the host and inferior vaccine protection. PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response. To test this, we measured both antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs after the administration of a nonreplicating human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing porcine IFN-α (Ad5–pIFN-α) at the time of PRRSV infection and compared the results to those for pigs infected with PRRSV alone. Viremia was delayed, and there was a decrease in viral load in the sera of pigs administered the Ad5–pIFN-α. Although seroconversion was slightly delayed in pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, probably due to the early reduction in viral replication, little difference in the overall or neutralizing antibody response was seen. However, there was an increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells detected in the pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, as well as an altered cytokine profile in the lung at 14 days postinfection, indicating that the presence of IFN-α at the time of infection can alter innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV.","PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response.","['PRRSV', 'elevated_IFN-α_levels', 'infection', 'the_induction_time', 'elements', 'the_adaptive_immune_response']","['PRRSV', 'elevated IFN-α levels', 'infection', 'the induction time', 'elements', 'the adaptive immune response']",PRRSV,elevated IFN-α levels,infection,the induction time,elements,the adaptive immune response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artificial microRNAs are small molecules which are expressed through endogenous microRNA machinery by RNA polymerase II. These artificial microRNAs effectively inhibit gene expression and are non-toxic to the host cell. VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to VEEV replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp using artificial microRNAs may efficiently inhibit VEEV replication. Five artificial microRNAs were tested in vitro in BHK cells. Three of these artificial miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEEV replication. Further, these microRNAs were cloned into the expression vector in combination to see the synergistic effect on VEEV replication. Combination of more than one miRNA did not result in significant inhibition of virus replication.

This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations. RESULTS: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. CONCLUSION: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified.

In general, axonal degeneration is detrimental for hosts. However, axonal degeneration can be beneficial in the case of infection with neurotropic viruses that spread in the CNS using axonal transport. C57BL/Wld(S) (Wld(S), Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) mice are protected from axonal degeneration. Wld(S) mice infected with the neurovirulent GDVII strain of TMEV are more resistant to virus infection than wild-type mice, suggesting that axonal preservation contributes to the resistance. By contrast, infection with the less virulent Daniels strain of TMEV results in high levels of virus propagation in the CNS, suggesting that prolonged survival of axons in Wld(S) mice favors virus spread. Thus, axonal degeneration might be a beneficial self-destruct mechanism that limits the spread of neurotropic viruses, in the case of less virulent virus infection. We hypothesize that neurons use ‘built-in’ self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site. Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication. Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus. Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses. Thus, the balance between neurodegeneration and virus propagation may be taken into account in the future design of neuroprotective therapy.","We hypothesize that neurons use ‘built-in’ self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site.","['neurons', 'self-destruct_protection_machinery', 'neurodegeneration', 'the_CNS']","['neurons', 'self-destruct protection machinery', 'neurodegeneration', 'the CNS']",neurons,self-destruct protection machinery,neurodegeneration,the CNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a ‘fast-forward’ evolution enables viruses to rapidly adapt to new host species, evade host immune responses, and to develop resistance to anti-viral drugs. Similarly, rapid evolution allows viruses to attain new levels of virulence, defined as the ability to cause severe disease in hosts. We hypothesize that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants that modulate virulence that have been acquired through convergent evolution. Thus, common patterns reflecting changing virulence-related specific viral groups could be detected. The main goals for this project are (1) to understand how genetic and phenotypic diversity can be generated among different viral groups by analyzing the variation patterns and determining the selective forces behind them (impact in viral fitness) and (2) to understand how fixed mutations can modulate virulence within different viral groups by performing comparison of strains with differing virulence within a longitudinal timescale. The subject of the study is key emerging and re-emerging virus families of medical importance. Such groups include: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses), Picornaviridae (Hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (Yellow fever, West Nile, Hepatitis C, Dengue, and Zika viruses), Togaviridae (Rubella and Chikungunya virus), Bornaviridae (Borna-disease virus), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses), Paramyxoviridae (Measles, Nipah, and Hendra viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Lyssaviruses), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Bunyaviridae (Hanta- and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses), and Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A viruses). Viral genomes collected at different time points, different hosts (human and their most closely related animal reservoirs) and different locations will be compiled. Extensive molecular evolutionary analyses will be carried out to infer gene expansion/contraction within groups, rates of evolution, and changes in selection pressure, including the detection of positive selected genes and sites (adaptive evolution). Positively selected sites will be mapped onto the viral protein structures to reveal their impact on function, and hence the location of potential virulence determinants. Virulence changes among particular viral strains and types will be defined and measured according to definitions based on an increase in: (1) transmissibility, (2) host tropism, (3) immune evasion, (4) morbidity and mortality, (5) drug resistance, and by the incorporation of epidemiological data to determine whether high or low virulence strains within different hosts and localities are spreading most efficiently in nature.",We hypothesize that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants that modulate virulence that have been acquired through convergent evolution.,"['that distinct_viral_groups share genetic_determinants', 'virulence', 'convergent_evolution']","['that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants', 'virulence', 'convergent evolution']",that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants,virulence,convergent evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.",Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms.,"['Movement', 'animals', 'farms', 'a_role', 'the_spread', 'PED', 'farms']","['Movement', 'animals', 'farms', 'a role', 'the spread', 'PED', 'farms']",Movement,animals,farms,a role,the spread,PED,farms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection.

We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation.

Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimens. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies.

The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2% to 30%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.","We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2% to 30%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot.","['this_hypothesis', 'the_mechanical_properties', 'a_panel', 'pseudoknots', 'frameshifting_efficiencies', '2%', 'to_30%', 'four_pseudoknots', 'retroviruses', 'luteoviruses', 'a_coronavirus', 'a_nonframeshifting_bacteriophage_pseudoknot']","['this hypothesis', 'the mechanical properties', 'a panel', 'pseudoknots', 'frameshifting efficiencies', '2%', 'to 30%', 'four pseudoknots', 'retroviruses', 'luteoviruses', 'a coronavirus', 'a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot']",this hypothesis,the mechanical properties,a panel,pseudoknots,frameshifting efficiencies,2%,to 30%,four pseudoknots,retroviruses,luteoviruses,a coronavirus,a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols. To investigate the quantity and size of aerosols emitted when the instrument is played, eight healthy volunteers were asked to blow a vuvuzela. For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 658×10(3) per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.7×10(3) per litre for shouting, representing a mean log(10) difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p<0.001). The majority (>97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons. Further investigation is required to assess the potential of the vuvuzela to contribute to the transmission of aerosol borne diseases.

It is usually a self-limiting disease; however, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), which cause up to two-thirds of colds, have temperature-dependent replication and most HRV strains replicate optimally at 33°C. Delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways has the potential to reduce viral replication, but evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment of the common cold is inconclusive. We plan to test the hypothesis that delivery of humidified air heated to 41°C at high flow, nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF), for 2 hours daily for five days is more effective in reducing common cold symptom severity and duration than five days of ‘sham’ rhinothermy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial comparing rNHF to ‘sham’ rhinothermy in the treatment of common cold. We plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms of common cold and randomise them 1:1 to receive one of the two treatments for five days. The study duration is 14 days, which includes clinic visits on the first day of randomisation and four days post-randomisation, and a phone call on the 14th day.

To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only ∼50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (∼0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15mm, 20kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells. In conclusion, mPEG-modification of either RSV or the host cell is a highly effective prophylactic strategy for preventing viral infection.","To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)","['the_risk', 'RSV_infection', 'that_bioengineering', 'either_the_virus_particle', 'host_cell', 'the_covalent_grafting', 'methoxypoly(ethylene_glycol']","['the risk', 'RSV infection', 'that bioengineering', 'either the virus particle', 'host cell', 'the covalent grafting', 'methoxypoly(ethylene glycol']",the risk,RSV infection,that bioengineering,either the virus particle,host cell,the covalent grafting,methoxypoly(ethylene glycol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause.

Therefore, it is potentially one of the most important vehicles for promoting peace among the peoples of the world. Although previous South Korean governments have historically proposed a variety of actions to contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula, there has been little success. However, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, the hallmark of the Sunshine Policy of former president of South Korea, Dae Jung Kim, is different from previous tourism initiatives as it has had more tangible and practical outcomes that have contributed to the promotion of peace on the divided Peninsula. To this end, the South Korean government has applied the insights of neofunctionalism to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. This is an approach to integration theory from the perspective of liberalism that has been heralded in international politics. According to this approach, it is expected that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development can be used as a tool to maintain peaceful circumstances, which results in spill-over effects, enlargement of activity scopes, and a heightened level of commitment on the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. To test this hypothesis, this study proposes a Peace Index and investigates the spill-over effects by utilizing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a test case. The results of this study indicate that the view that tourism contributes to peace is valid but tenuous since the impact of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in the promotion of peace was less significant than expected. Consequently, the results of this study also indicate that neofunctionalism, which has been developed for western political systems, needs to be re-examined when applied to the unique, dynamic, and complex political circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.",The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt.

However, a complete genomic sequence analysis showed that ck/CH/LGX/130530 was more closely related to a Massachusetts type strain (95% similarity to strain H120) than to the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (86%), suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, and it showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 emerged from a recombination event between parental IBV H120 strain and pathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus. The results obtained from the pairwise comparison and nucleotide similarity showed that the recombination breakpoint was located in the nsp14 gene at nucleotides 17055–17083.

Furthermore, vaccination with the LDT3-A vaccine, which was derived from the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain by serial passaging in chicken eggs, provided good protection against challenge with the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, in contrast to the poor protection offered with the H120 vaccine. Interestingly, isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 exhibited low pathogenicity toward specific-pathogen-free chickens compared with the nephropathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, which was likely due to natural recombination in the 5′ 17-kb region of the genome.

In vitro frameshift assays were performed on retroviral gag-pro frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots and their derivatives, a pseudoknot from the gene 32 mRNA of bacteriophage T2 that is not naturally associated with frameshifting, and hybrids of these pseudoknots. Results show that the gag-pro pseudoknot from human endogenous retrovirus-K10 (HERV) stimulates a -1 frameshift with an efficiency similar to that of the closely related retrovirus MMTV. The bacteriophage T2 mRNA pseudoknot was found to be a poor stimulator of frameshifting, supporting a hypothesis that the retroviral pseudoknots have distinctive properties that make them efficient frameshift stimulators. A hybrid, designed by combining features of the bacteriophage and retroviral pseudoknots, was found to stimulate frameshifting while retaining significant structural similarity to the nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Mutational analyses of the retroviral and hybrid pseudoknots were used to evaluate the effects of an unpaired (wedged) adenosine at the junction of the pseudoknot stems, changing the base pairs near the junction of the two stems, and changing the identity of the loop 2 nucleotide nearest the junction of the stems. Pseudoknots both with and without the wedged adenosine can stimulate frameshifting, though the identities of the nucleotides near the stem1/stem2 junction do influence efficiency. NMR data showed that the bacteriophage and hybrid pseudoknots are similar in their local structure at the junction of the stems, indicating that pseudoknots that are similar in this structural feature can differ radically in their ability to stimulate frameshifting. NMR methods were used to compare the internal motions of the bacteriophage T2 pseudoknot and representative frameshifting pseudoknots. The stems of the investigated pseudoknots are similarly well ordered on the time scales to which nitrogen-15 relaxation data are sensitive; however, solvent exchange rates for protons at the junction of the two stems of the nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot are significantly slower than the analogous protons in the representative frameshifting pseudoknots.","The bacteriophage T2 mRNA pseudoknot was found to be a poor stimulator of frameshifting, supporting a hypothesis that the retroviral pseudoknots have distinctive properties that make them efficient frameshift stimulators.","['The_bacteriophage_T2', 'mRNA_pseudoknot', 'a_poor_stimulator', 'frameshifting', 'a_hypothesis', 'the_retroviral_pseudoknots', 'distinctive_properties', 'frameshift', 'stimulators']","['The bacteriophage T2', 'mRNA pseudoknot', 'a poor stimulator', 'frameshifting', 'a hypothesis', 'the retroviral pseudoknots', 'distinctive properties', 'frameshift', 'stimulators']",The bacteriophage T2,mRNA pseudoknot,a poor stimulator,frameshifting,a hypothesis,the retroviral pseudoknots,distinctive properties,frameshift,stimulators,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the viral structural proteins, the N protein plays a pivot role in assembly process of viral particles as well as viral replication and transcription. The SARS-CoV N proteins expressed in the eukaryotes, such as yeast and HEK293 cells, appeared in the multiple spots on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), whereas the proteins expressed in E. coli showed a single 2DE spot. These 2DE spots were further examined by Western blot and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, and identified as the N proteins with differently apparent pI values and similar molecular mass of 50kDa. In the light of the observations and other evidences, a hypothesis was postulated that the SARS-CoV N protein could be phosphorylated in eukaryotes. To locate the plausible regions of phosphorylation in the N protein, two truncated N proteins were generated in E. coli and treated with PKCα. The two truncated N proteins after incubation of PKCα exhibited the differently electrophoretic behaviors on 2DE, suggesting that the region of 1–256 aa in the N protein was the possible target for PKCα phosphorylation. Moreover, the SARS-CoV N protein expressed in yeast were partially digested with trypsin and carefully analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In contrast to the completely tryptic digestion, these partially digested fragments generated two new peptide mass signals with neutral loss, and MS/MS analysis revealed two phosphorylated peptides located at the “dense serine” island in the N protein with amino acid sequences, GFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSSR and GNSGNSTPGSSRGNSPARMASGGGK. With the PKCα phosphorylation treatment and the partially tryptic digestion, the N protein expressed in E. coli released the same peptides as observed in yeast cells. Thus, this investigation provided the preliminary data to determine the phosphorylation sites in the SARS-CoV N protein, and partially clarified the argument regarding the phosphorylation possibility of the N protein during the infection process of SARS-CoV to human host.","In the light of the observations and other evidences, a hypothesis was postulated that the SARS-CoV N protein could be phosphorylated in eukaryotes.","['the_light', 'the_observations', 'other_evidences', 'a_hypothesis', 'the_SARS-CoV_N_protein', 'eukaryotes']","['the light', 'the observations', 'other evidences', 'a hypothesis', 'the SARS-CoV N protein', 'eukaryotes']",the light,the observations,other evidences,a hypothesis,the SARS-CoV N protein,eukaryotes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II. An “alternate” arm of the RAS now exists in which ACE2 counterbalances the effects of the classic RAS through degradation of Ang II, and generation of the vasodilator Ang 1-7. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. The catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding, resulting in ACE2 in the circulation. The ACE2 gene maps to a quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome in three strains of genetically hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACE2 may be a candidate gene for hypertension. It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension. Experimental hypertension studies have measured ACE2 in either the heart or kidney and/or plasma, and have reported that deletion or inhibition of ACE2 leads to hypertension, whilst enhancing ACE2 protects against the development of hypertension, hence increasing ACE2 may be a therapeutic option for the management of high blood pressure in man. There have been relatively few studies of ACE2, either at the gene or the circulating level in patients with hypertension. Plasma ACE2 activity is low in healthy subjects, but elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease.

The hypothesis was that in vitro stimulation of RPE cells with Aβ(1-40), a constituent of drusen, promotes changes in gene expression and cellular pathways associated with the pathogenesis of AMD, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis. METHODS: Confluent human RPE cells were stimulated with Aβ(1-40), or the reverse peptide Aβ(40-1), and genome wide changes in gene expression were studied with gene microarrays. Selected genes were verified by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Pathway analysis with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and ingenuity revealed top functional pathways in RPE after Aβ(1-40) stimulation. RESULTS: RPE cells stimulated with Aβ(1-40) (0.3 μM) for 24 hours resulted in 63 upregulated and 22 downregulated previously known genes. The upregulated genes were predominantly in inflammatory and immune response categories, but other categories were also represented, including apoptosis, cell signaling, cell proliferation, and signal transduction. Categories of downregulated genes included immune response, transporters, metabolic functions and transcription factors. ELISA confirmed that secreted levels of IL-8 were two times higher than control levels. GSEA and ingenuity analysis confirmed that the top affected pathways in RPE cells after Aβ(1-40) stimulation were inflammation and immune response related. Surprisingly, few angiogenic pathways were activated at the doses and exposure times studied. CONCLUSIONS: Aβ(1-40) promotes RPE gene expression changes in pathways associated with immune response, inflammation, and cytokine and interferon signaling pathways. Results may relate to in vivo mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of AMD.","The hypothesis was that in vitro stimulation of RPE cells with Aβ(1-40), a constituent of drusen, promotes changes in gene expression and cellular pathways associated with the pathogenesis of AMD, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis.","['The_hypothesis', 'vitro_stimulation', 'RPE_cells', 'Aβ(1', 'a_constituent', 'drusen', 'changes', 'gene_expression', 'cellular_pathways', 'the_pathogenesis', 'AMD', 'oxidative_stress', 'inflammation', 'angiogenesis']","['The hypothesis', 'vitro stimulation', 'RPE cells', 'Aβ(1', 'a constituent', 'drusen', 'changes', 'gene expression', 'cellular pathways', 'the pathogenesis', 'AMD', 'oxidative stress', 'inflammation', 'angiogenesis']",The hypothesis,vitro stimulation,RPE cells,Aβ(1,a constituent,drusen,changes,gene expression,cellular pathways,the pathogenesis,AMD,oxidative stress,inflammation,angiogenesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011. METHODS: Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of two million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting. This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk. RESULTS: 65 outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the serial interval to be 1.86 days (95% CI 1.6 to 2.2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was not significant (p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward.","We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk.","['a_permutation_test', 'all_outbreaks', 'chance', 'proximity', 'transmission_risk']","['a permutation test', 'all outbreaks', 'chance', 'proximity', 'transmission risk']",a permutation test,all outbreaks,chance,proximity,transmission risk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This entity was named MERS for’ Middle East respiratory syndrome’. By January 9, 2014, the disease had already struck 178 persons of whom 75 died from respiratory failure and diarrhoea. As the new disease was very similar to the deadly SARS (2002–2003) and since it was provoked by a Betacoronavirus, chiroptera were first suspected to be at the origin of this infection. Morever, recent studies performed in Saudi Arabia showed that one individual of the bat Taphozous perforatus harbored a short nucleotide segment identical to the homologous segment present in the viral strain isolated from the index-case of the epidemic. In addition, many strains of Betacoronavirus more or less related to those responsible for the MERS disease in man have been isolated from bats in Africa, Asia and Europe. However, another hypothesis was simultaneously proposed incriminating dromedary (Camelus dromedarius L.) as a likely actor in the transmission to human beings of the disease.We then reviewed data relative to other viral zoonosis in which dromedary was possibly implicated. This led to the provisional conclusion that this large mammal might play a role in the dissemination of the MERS-COV, the etiologic agent of the disease.

More recent studies showed that angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which degrades ANGII to form ANG1–7, is protective but severely downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. Here it was theorized that ACE-2 and its product ANG1–7 might therefore regulate AEC apoptosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, the AEC cell line MLE-12 and primary cultures of rat AECs were exposed to the profibrotic apoptosis inducers ANGII or bleomycin (Bleo). Markers of apoptosis (caspase-9 or -3 activation and nuclear fragmentation), steady-state ANGII and ANG1–7, and JNK phosphorylation were measured thereafter. In the absence of Bleo, inhibition of ACE-2 by small interfering RNA or by a competitive inhibitor (DX600 peptide) caused a reciprocal increase in autocrine ANGII and corresponding decrease in ANG1–7 in cell culture media (both P < 0.05) and, moreover, induced AEC apoptosis. At baseline (without inhibitor), ANG1–7 in culture media was 10-fold higher than ANGII (P < 0.01). Addition of purified ANGII or bleomycin-induced caspase activation, nuclear fragmentation, and JNK phosphorylation in cultured AECs. However, preincubation with ANG1–7 (0.1 μM) prevented JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment with A779, a specific blocker of the ANG1–7 receptor mas, prevented ANG1–7 blockade of JNK phosphorylation, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. These data demonstrate that ACE-2 regulates AEC survival by balancing the proapoptotic ANGII and its antiapoptotic degradation product ANG1–7. They also suggest that ANG1–7 inhibits AEC apoptosis through the ANG1–7 receptor mas.","To evaluate this hypothesis, the AEC cell line MLE-12 and primary cultures of rat AECs were exposed to the profibrotic apoptosis inducers ANGII or bleomycin (Bleo).","['the_AEC_cell_line', 'MLE-12', 'primary_cultures', 'rat_AECs', 'apoptosis', 'ANGII', 'bleomycin', 'Bleo']","['the AEC cell line', 'MLE-12', 'primary cultures', 'rat AECs', 'apoptosis', 'ANGII', 'bleomycin', 'Bleo']",the AEC cell line,MLE-12,primary cultures,rat AECs,apoptosis,ANGII,bleomycin,Bleo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we assessed or re-assessed some effects of IFN-γ on a number of human lung epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, chosen for their wide use in the literature, we found that alveolar epithelial cells were more sensitive to IFN-γ, in terms of proliferation inhibition and enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis. While similar effects were obtained on fibroblasts, concentrations of IFN-γ 4–8-fold greater were required. In addition, both epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines were able to secrete large quantities of T cell-targeting chemokines, similar to the ones detected in SARS patients.

In recent years, antigen mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens. However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure. To address this question, we used human IgE as the self structure and a well-defined anti-human IgE mAb (BSW17). We describe the isolation of two anti- idiotypic antibodies specific for the anti-IgE antibody BSW17 from a non-immune human Fab phage display library. Interestingly, these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described IgE peptide mimotope isolated by panning on BSW17, but they cover a much larger epitope on the IgE molecule. Accordingly, immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-affinity antibodies with the same characteristics as BSW17. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation, and confirm Jerne’s hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins.","According to Jerne’s network hypothesis, the binding site of an anti-idiotypic antibody also represents the internal image of an epitope present on a foreign, or even a self antigen.","['Jerne ’s network_hypothesis', 'the_binding_site', 'an_anti-idiotypic_antibody', 'the_internal_image', 'an_epitope', 'a_foreign', 'even_a_self_antigen']","['Jerne ’s network hypothesis', 'the binding site', 'an anti-idiotypic antibody', 'the internal image', 'an epitope', 'a foreign', 'even a self antigen']",Jerne ’s network hypothesis,the binding site,an anti-idiotypic antibody,the internal image,an epitope,a foreign,even a self antigen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species’ fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide- and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants’ feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission.

The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery.

Study Selection Articles were selected for their relevance to viruses and their role in asthma. Results Much of the data in support of the viral role in asthma focuses on rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiologic studies have used factors such as day-care and family size as surrogates for infection in studies that support and negate the role of viruses in the development of asthma. A large volume of literature supports the theory that virus exacerbates preexisting asthma by setting off the inflammatory cascade. No mechanistic studies fully explain how viral infections can translate or exacerbate atopic disease. We provide information from our mouse model that suggests that dendritic cells, IgE, and FcɛRI are critical to the induction of atopy. Studies of patients taking antiviral agents (eg, ribavirin or palvizumab) support the notion that interfering with respiratory viral infections may decrease the development of atopy. Conclusions Many studies suggest strongly that viral infections may predispose patients to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases.

This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.","This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit.","['the_possible_reasons', 'the_two_most_common_small_companion_animal_species', 'the_hypothesis', 'cats', 'a_genetically-determined_immunological_resistance', 'arthropod_vectors', 'the_microparasites']","['the possible reasons', 'the two most common small companion animal species', 'the hypothesis', 'cats', 'a genetically-determined immunological resistance', 'arthropod vectors', 'the microparasites']",the possible reasons,the two most common small companion animal species,the hypothesis,cats,a genetically-determined immunological resistance,arthropod vectors,the microparasites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole‐body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells. To decisively test whether and to what extent WBI in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages, we exposed young male C57BL/6 mice to sublethal WBI (0.5–4 Gy), mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe. We followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age. None of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock‐irradiated (0 Gy) animals for the parameters measured. Even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal WBI in youth (4 Gy) exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis, robust T‐ and B‐cell responses to live attenuated West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal WNV challenge. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model.","Unrepaired DNA damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence, which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age‐related phenotypes.","['Unrepaired_DNA_damage', 'cellular_senescence', 'the_underlying_cause', 'certain_age‐related_phenotypes']","['Unrepaired DNA damage', 'cellular senescence', 'the underlying cause', 'certain age‐related phenotypes']",Unrepaired DNA damage,cellular senescence,the underlying cause,certain age‐related phenotypes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-γ by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-γ and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17-mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface.

Unlike the mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes, which largely target mRNA from the 5′ and 3′ end, viruses instead use endonucleases that cleave their targets internally. This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s). Yet, how mRNA endonuclease specificity is achieved in mammalian cells remains largely unresolved. Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity.","This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s).","['mRNA', 'selective_power', 'a_targeting_motif(s']","['mRNA', 'selective power', 'a targeting motif(s']",mRNA,selective power,a targeting motif(s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RSV vaccine development has been hampered by results of clinical trials in the 1960s, when formalin-inactivated whole-RSV preparations adjuvated with alum (FI-RSV) were found to predispose infants for enhanced disease following subsequent natural RSV infection. We have reproduced this apparently immunopathological phenomenon in infant cynomolgus macaques and identified immunological and pathological correlates. Vaccination with FI-RSV induced specific virus-neutralizing antibody responses accompanied by strong lymphoproliferative responses. The vaccine-induced RSV-specific T cells predominantly produced the Th2 cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-5. Intratracheal challenge with a macaque-adapted wild-type RSV 3 months after the third vaccination elicited a hypersensitivity response associated with lung eosinophilia. The challenge resulted in a rapid boosting of IL-13-producing T cells in the FI-RSV-vaccinated animals but not in the FI-measles virus-vaccinated control animals. Two out of seven FI-RSV-vaccinated animals died 12 days after RSV challenge with pulmonary hyperinflation. Surprisingly, the lungs of these two animals did not show overt inflammatory lesions.

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D). Alanine replacement of the motif I residues (AA-E-D; four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to that of MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low-passage-number (passage 10 [P10]) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion.","['MHV-ExoN-AA', 'genetic_pathways', 'AA', 'DE', 'reversion']","['MHV-ExoN-AA', 'genetic pathways', 'AA', 'DE', 'reversion']",MHV-ExoN-AA,genetic pathways,AA,DE,reversion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV-1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge when compared to other viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large naïve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of henipaviruses. We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity, and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnAbs against the HIV-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data.

We had suggested first that, in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans, might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. Indeed, statistical analyses suggested strong negative correlations between the allele frequency and historical parameters including the colonization dates by Mediterranean civilisations. The gene flows from colonizers to native populations were extremely low but colonizers are responsible of the spread of several diseases suggesting that the dissemination of parasites in naive populations could have induced a breakdown rupture of the fragile pathocenosis changing the balance among diseases. The new equilibrium state has been reached through a negative selection of the null allele. RESULTS: Most of the human diseases are zoonoses and cat might have been instrumental in the decrease of the allele frequency, because its diffusion through Europe was a gradual process, due principally to Romans; and that several cat zoonoses could be transmitted to man. The possible implication of a feline lentivirus (FIV) which does not use CCR5 as co-receptor is discussed. This virus can infect primate cells in vitro and induces clinical signs in macaque. Moreover, most of the historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-Δ32 allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs. CONCLUSION: We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading.

Catheter ablation represents a suitable therapeutic approach. However, the exact localization of the origin can be challenging, especially in cases of low PB burden during the procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated mapping algorithm on the basis of the hypothesis that mathematical optimization would significantly accelerate the localization of earliest activation. METHODS: The algorithm is based on iterative regression analyses. When acquiring local activation times (LATs) within a 3-dimensional anatomic map of the corresponding heart chamber, this algorithm is able to identify that exact position where a next LAT measurement adds maximum information about the predicted site of origin. Furthermore, on the basis of the acquired LAT measurements, the algorithm is able to predict earliest activation with high accuracy.

Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high- and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro.

Molecular tools enhance case definitions, increasing specificity and reducing misclassification, and are now a standard tool in outbreak investigations. Although it is assumed during an outbreak that a single microbe is causing the clinical symptoms, it is possible that a microbe of the same genus and species but different strain is causing disease during the same time period.

Molecular tools also facilitate estimating parameters key to understanding the transmission system, including the incidence, prevalence, transmission probability, duration of carriage, effective dose, and probability of effective contact.

The traditional view of these RNA elements are as local structures present in non-coding regions. However, this view is changing due to the discovery of regulatory elements in coding regions and functional long-range intra-genomic base pairing interactions. The ∼4.8 kb long RNA genome of the tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) contains these types of structural features, including six different functional long-distance interactions. We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and, accordingly, we sought to assess the global conformation of the entire TBSV genome. Atomic force micrographs of the genome indicated a mostly condensed structure composed of interconnected protrusions extending from a central hub. This configuration was consistent with the genomic secondary structure model generated using high-throughput selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (i.e. SHAPE), which predicted different sized RNA domains originating from a central region. Known RNA elements were identified in both domain and inter-domain regions, and novel structural features were predicted and functionally confirmed. Interestingly, only two of the six long-range interactions known to form were present in the structural model. However, for those interactions that did not form, complementary partner sequences were positioned relatively close to each other in the structure, suggesting that the secondary structure level of viral genome structure could provide a basic scaffold for the formation of different long-range interactions. The higher-order structural model for the TBSV RNA genome provides a snapshot of the complex framework that allows multiple functional components to operate in concert within a confined context.","We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and,","['these_multiple_interactions', 'a_large-scale_organizational_strategy']","['these multiple interactions', 'a large-scale organizational strategy']",these multiple interactions,a large-scale organizational strategy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. Aim of the study We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. Materials and methods Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-β were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18β-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300μg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to counteract viral infection. Conclusions Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18β-GA may be one of its active constituents.",We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines.,"['the_hypothesis', 'Radix_Glycyrrhizae', 'HRSV-induced_plaque_formation', 'respiratory_mucosal_cell_lines']","['the hypothesis', 'Radix Glycyrrhizae', 'HRSV-induced plaque formation', 'respiratory mucosal cell lines']",the hypothesis,Radix Glycyrrhizae,HRSV-induced plaque formation,respiratory mucosal cell lines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, induction of the host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO1), by interferon gamma (IFNγ) is one of the primary protective responses against chlamydial infection. However, despite the presence of a robust IFNγ response, active and replicating C. trachomatis can be detected in cervical secretions of women. We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFNγ response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel method to separate a pool of cells exposed to C. trachomatis into pure populations of live infected and bystander cells and applied this technique to distinguish between the effects of IFNγ on infected and bystander cells. Our findings revealed that the protective induction of IDO1 is suppressed specifically within primary infected cells because Chlamydia attenuates the nuclear import of activated STAT1 following IFNγ exposure, without affecting STAT1 levels or phosphorylation. Critically, the IFNγ-mediated induction of IDO1 activity is unhindered in bystander cells. Therefore, the IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism is functional in these cells, transforming these bystander cells into inhospitable hosts for a secondary C. trachomatis infection.","We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFNγ response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells.","['a_primary_C._trachomatis_infection', 'the_IFNγ_response', 'the protective effect', 'cytokine', 'its_activation', 'tryptophan_catabolism', 'bystander_cells']","['a primary C. trachomatis infection', 'the IFNγ response', 'the protective effect', 'cytokine', 'its activation', 'tryptophan catabolism', 'bystander cells']",a primary C. trachomatis infection,the IFNγ response,the protective effect,cytokine,its activation,tryptophan catabolism,bystander cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. RESULTS: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days.

Models predict that rapid spread decreases with the frequency and diversity of resistance alleles in the host population. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are scarce. Arabiodpsis thaliana—tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) provides an experimentally suitable pathosystem to explore the interplay between genetic variation in host's susceptibility and virus diversity. Systemic infection of A. thaliana with TEV is controlled by three dominant loci, with different ecotypes varying in susceptibility depending on the genetic constitution at these three loci. Here, we show that the TEV adaptation to a susceptible ecotype allowed the virus to successfully infect, replicate and induce symptoms in ecotypes that were fully resistant to the ancestral virus. The value of these results is twofold. First, we showed that the existence of partially susceptible individuals allows for the emerging virus to bypass resistance alleles that the virus has never encountered. Second, the concept of resistance genes may only be valid for a well-defined viral genotype but not for polymorphic viral populations.","However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are scarce.",['empirical_tests'],['empirical tests'],empirical tests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, it was hypothesized that TCRV was naturally hosted by artibeus bats. This is in stark contrast to other arenaviruses with known hosts, all of which are rodents. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) to determine whether they could be persistently infected without substantial pathology. We subcutaneously or intranasally infected bats with TCRV strain TRVL-11573, the only remaining strain of TCRV, and found that low-dose (10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID(50)]) inoculations resulted in asymptomatic and apathogenic infection and virus clearance, while high-dose (10(6) TCID(50)) inoculations caused substantial morbidity and mortality as early as 10 days postinfection. Uninoculated cage mates failed to seroconvert, and viral RNA was not detected in their tissues, suggesting that transmission did not occur.

Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission.

Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences.

Objectives The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic PTSD in SARS survivors. Design PTSD at 30 months after the SARS outbreak was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Survivors' demographic data, medical information and psychosocial variables were collected for risk factor analysis. Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of SARS and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS. Associated factors included higher-chance external locus of control, higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity. Conclusion The study of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS showed that the predictive value of acute medical variables may fade out. Our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of PTSD. On the contrary, the adversity both before and after the SARS outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from PTSD. The risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the SARS survivors.

Using a system based on transfection of cells with synthetic nonreplicable subgenomic transcripts derived from bovine viral diarrhea virus (family Flaviviridae), the existence of a replication-independent mechanism of RNA recombination, in addition to the commonly accepted replicative copy-choice recombination, has been previously proven (A. Gallei et al., J. Virol. 78:6271–6281, 2004). To identify RNA signals involved in efficient joining of RNA molecules, RNA recombination in living cells was targeted to the 3′ nontranslated region. Molecular characterization of 40 independently emerged recombinant viruses revealed that the majority of recombination sites are located in single-stranded regions of the RNA molecules. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that the frequency of RNA recombination directly correlated with the RNA amounts of both recombination partners.

However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.","In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays.","['this_article', 'the_hypothesis', 'an_electricity-free_heater', 'exothermic_chemical_reactions', 'engineered_phase_change_materials', 'isothermal_NA_amplification assays']","['this article', 'the hypothesis', 'an electricity-free heater', 'exothermic chemical reactions', 'engineered phase change materials', 'isothermal NA amplification assays']",this article,the hypothesis,an electricity-free heater,exothermic chemical reactions,engineered phase change materials,isothermal NA amplification assays,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a subject of controversy and a considerable scientific literature, we think that a solid understanding of ME/CFS pathogenesis is emerging. In this study, we compiled recent findings and placed them in the context of the clinical picture and natural history of the disease. A pattern emerged, giving rise to an explanatory model. ME/CFS often starts after or during an infection. A logical explanation is that the infection initiates an autoreactive process, which affects several functions, including brain and energy metabolism. According to our model for ME/CFS pathogenesis, patients with a genetic predisposition and dysbiosis experience a gradual development of B cell clones prone to autoreactivity. Under normal circumstances these B cell offsprings would have led to tolerance. Subsequent exogenous microbial exposition (triggering) can lead to comorbidities such as fibromyalgia, thyroid disorder, and orthostatic hypotension. A decisive infectious trigger may then lead to immunization against autoantigens involved in aerobic energy production and/or hormone receptors and ion channel proteins, producing postexertional malaise and ME/CFS, affecting both muscle and brain. In principle, cloning and sequencing of immunoglobulin variable domains could reveal the evolution of pathogenic clones. Although evidence consistent with the model accumulated in recent years, there are several missing links in it. Hopefully, the hypothesis generates testable propositions that can augment the understanding of the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.","Hopefully, the hypothesis generates testable propositions that can augment the understanding of the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.","['the_hypothesis', 'testable_propositions', 'the_understanding', 'the_pathogenesis', 'ME/CFS']","['the hypothesis', 'testable propositions', 'the understanding', 'the pathogenesis', 'ME/CFS']",the hypothesis,testable propositions,the understanding,the pathogenesis,ME/CFS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type VEE glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged mice within novel models of severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from SARS-CoV disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza virus challenge model.

Understanding the genes that control tolerance and resistance could provide new strategies to improve the health and welfare of livestock. Around one sixth of the world cattle population is estimated to be at risk from one of the most debilitating tick-borne diseases of cattle, caused by the protozoan parasite, Theileria annulata. The parasite mainly infects cells of the myeloid lineage which are also the main producers of inflammatory cytokines. If an infectious or inflammatory insult is sufficiently great, inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages enter the circulation and induce an acute phase proteins (APP) response. The Bos taurus Holstein breed produces higher and more prolonged levels of inflammatory cytokine induced APP than the Bos indicus Sahiwal breed in response to experimental infection with T. annulata. The Sahiwal exhibits significantly less pathology and survives infection, unlike the Holstein breed. Therefore, we hypothesised that the causal genes were likely to be expressed in macrophages and control the production of inflammatory cytokines. A functional genomics approach revealed that the transcriptome profile of the B. taurus macrophages was more associated with an inflammatory programme than the B. indicus macrophages. In particular the most differentially expressed gene was a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family. These are mainly expressed on myeloid cell surfaces and control inflammatory responses. Other differentially expressed genes included bovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (BoLA) class II genes, particularly BoLA DQ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)B2. We are now exploring whether sequence and functional differences in the bovine SIRP family may underlie the resistance or tolerance to T. annulata between the breeds. Potentially, our research may also have more general implications for the control of inflammatory processes against other pathogens. Genes controlling the balance between pathology and protection may determine how livestock can survive in the face of infectious onslaught. Next generation sequencing and RNAi methodologies for livestock species will bring new opportunities to link diversity at the genome level to functional differences in health traits in livestock species.","Therefore, we hypothesised that the causal genes were likely to be expressed in macrophages and control the production of inflammatory cytokines.","['the_causal_genes', 'macrophages', 'control', 'inflammatory_cytokines']","['the causal genes', 'macrophages', 'control', 'inflammatory cytokines']",the causal genes,macrophages,control,inflammatory cytokines,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyethylenimine (PEI) is among the most efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors. Its efficiency and cytotoxicity depend on molecular weight, with the 25-kDa PEI being most efficient but cytotoxic. Smaller PEIs are noncytotoxic but less efficient. Enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity by cross-linking of small PEIs via potentially biodegradable linkages was explored herein. The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation’s effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity. Toward this goal, we carried out cross-linking of branched 2-kDa PEI and its 1:1 (w/w) mixture with a linear 423-Da PEI via ester- and/or amide-bearing linkages; the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiency, as well as toxicity to mammalian cells, of the resultant cross-linked polycations were investigated. METHODS. The efficiency of the cross-linked PEIs in delivering in vitro a plasmid containing β-galactosidase gene and their cytotoxicity were investigated in monkey kidney cells (COS-7). Dynamic light scattering was used to compare the relative DNA condensation efficiency of the unmodified and cross-linked PEIs. In vivo gene delivery efficiency was evaluated by intratracheal delivery in mice of the complexes of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and the PEIs and estimating the luciferase expression in the lungs. RESULTS. Cross-linking boosted the gene delivery efficiency of the small PEIs by 40- to 550-fold in vitro; the efficiency of the most potent conjugates even exceeded by an order of magnitude that of the branched 25-kDa PEI. Effective condensation of DNA was evident from the fact that the mean diameter of the complexes of the cross-linked PEIs was some 300 nm with a narrow size distribution, while the complexes of the unmodified small PEIs exhibited a mean size of >700 nm with a very broad size distribution. At concentrations where the 25-kDa PEI resulted in >95% cell death, the conjugates afforded nearly full cell viability. The cross-linked PEIs were 17 to 80 times m ore efficient than the unmodified ones in vivo; furthermore, their efficiencies were up to twice that of the 25-kDa PEI. CONCLUSIONS. Cross-linking of small PEIs with judiciously designed amide- and ester-bearing linkers boosts their gene delivery efficiency both in vitro and in vivo without increasing the cytotoxicity. The high efficiency is dependent on the nature of the linkages and the PEIs used.","The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation’s effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity.","['The_hypothesis', 'cross', 'the_polycation', 'hence_the_transfection_efficiency', 'biodegradable_linkages', 'DNA_delivery', 'cytotoxicity']","['The hypothesis', 'cross', 'the polycation', 'hence the transfection efficiency', 'biodegradable linkages', 'DNA delivery', 'cytotoxicity']",The hypothesis,cross,the polycation,hence the transfection efficiency,biodegradable linkages,DNA delivery,cytotoxicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cases, lncRNAs have been shown to be key regulators of several cellular processes. Therefore, there is a great need to understand the function of more lncRNAs and their regulation in response to stimuli. Interferon (IFN) is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response. IFN binding to its receptor activates transcription of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that function as potent antivirals. In addition, several ISGs are positive or negative regulators of the IFN pathway. This is essential to ensure a strong antiviral response and a later return of the cell to homeostasis. As the ISGs described to date are coding genes, we sought to determine whether IFN also regulates the expression of long non-coding ISGs. To this aim, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of control and HuH7 cells treated with IFNα2. The results show that IFN-treatment regulates the expression of several unknown non-coding transcripts. We have validated two lncRNAs upregulated after treatment with different doses of type I IFNα2 in different cells or with type III IFNλ. These lncRNAs were also induced by influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus mutants unable to block the IFN response, but not by several wild-type lytic viruses tested. These lncRNA genes were named lncISG15 and lncBST2 as they are located close to ISGs ISG15 and BST2, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition experiments showed that lncBST2 is a positive regulator of BST2. Therefore lncBST2 has been renamed BISPR, from BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator. Our results may have therapeutic implications as lncBST2/BISPR, but also lncISG15 and their coding neighbors, are increased in cells infected with hepatitis C virus and in the liver of infected patients. These results allow us to hypothesize that several lncRNAs could be activated by IFN to control the potency of the antiviral IFN response.",These results allow us to hypothesize that several lncRNAs could be activated by IFN to control the potency of the antiviral IFN response.,"['These_results', 'several_lncRNAs', 'IFN', 'the_potency', 'the_antiviral_IFN_response']","['These results', 'several lncRNAs', 'IFN', 'the potency', 'the antiviral IFN response']",These results,several lncRNAs,IFN,the potency,the antiviral IFN response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4(+) T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.","The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction.","['The_precise_neuropathogenesis', 'rabies', 'neuronal_death', 'dysfunction']","['The precise neuropathogenesis', 'rabies', 'neuronal death', 'dysfunction']",The precise neuropathogenesis,rabies,neuronal death,dysfunction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen. We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models. We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice. MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans. We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200(−/−) mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro. In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling. However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females. Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection. Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.",We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling.,"['CD200R_ligation', 'TLR7_responses', 'that_release', 'this_inhibition', 'sex_differences', 'TLR7']","['CD200R ligation', 'TLR7 responses', 'that release', 'this inhibition', 'sex differences', 'TLR7']",CD200R ligation,TLR7 responses,that release,this inhibition,sex differences,TLR7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic β cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6–phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by ∼90% as the granules mature.

Four of the total ten PRRSV NSPs tested were found to have strong to moderate inhibitory effects on beta interferon (IFN-β) promoter activation. The strongest inhibitory effect was exhibited by NSP1 followed by, NSP2, NSP11, and NSP4. We focused on NSP1α and NSP1β (self-cleavage products of NSP1 during virus infection) and NSP11, three NSPs with strong inhibitory activity. All of three proteins, when expressed stably in cell lines, strongly inhibited double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) signaling pathways. NSP1β was found to inhibit both IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)- and NF-κB-dependent gene induction by dsRNA and Sendai virus. Mechanistically, the dsRNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were strongly inhibited by NSP1β. Moreover, when tested in a porcine myelomonocytic cell line, NSP1β inhibited Sendai virus-mediated activation of porcine IFN-β promoter activity.

No direct interactions among SARS-CoV E protein with either α- or γ-ENaC were indentified.

This element, beginning immediately downstream of the nucleocapsid gene stop codon, was shown to be essential for virus replication. Other investigators discovered an adjacent downstream pseudoknot in the 3′ UTR of the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This pseudoknot was also shown to be essential for replication, and it has a conserved counterpart in every group 1 and group 2 coronavirus. In MHV and BCoV, the bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot are, in part, mutually exclusive, because of the overlap of the last segment of the stem-loop and stem 1 of the pseudoknot. This led us to hypothesize that they form a molecular switch, possibly regulating a transition occurring during viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed an extensive genetic analysis of the two components of this proposed switch. Our results define essential and nonessential components of these structures and establish the limits to which essential parts of each element can be destabilized prior to loss of function. Most notably, we have confirmed the interrelationship of the two putative switch elements. Additionally, we have identified a pseudoknot loop insertion mutation that appears to point to a genetic interaction between the pseudoknot and a distant region of the genome.","This led us to hypothesize that they form a molecular switch, possibly regulating a transition occurring during viral RNA synthesis.","['a_molecular_switch', 'a_transition', 'viral_RNA_synthesis']","['a molecular switch', 'a transition', 'viral RNA synthesis']",a molecular switch,a transition,viral RNA synthesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of FIC5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis. It also have been reported that FIC5.9 cannot be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear. METHODS: We formulated a hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by enzymes that are activated by post-blood collection and may be coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen in healthy blood. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that thrombin acts as an initiator for FIC5.9 releasing, and that mainly plasmin cleaves N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and neutrophil elastase cleave C-terminal end of FIC5.9.

Given that template copy numbers of viruses in latent infections can be very low, extremely sensitive PCR assays are needed to optimize detection efficiency. In this study, efficiency of several PCR assays designed for CFPHV detection is explored and compared to a method published previously. The results show that adoption of a triplet set of singleplex PCR assays outperforms other methods, with an approximately 3-fold increase in detection success in comparison to the standard assay.

Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 °C was similar to that at 37 °C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine.

It is known that in the case of viruses which bud off the infected cell membrane, virus-specific antibodies can induce antigenic modulation, i.e., spatial redistribution of viral antigens and modulation of their synthesis. To determine whether antigenic modulation occurs during VZV infection in vitro and could possibly be involved in viral persistence, we have grown infected cells in the presence of anti-VZV antibodies either transiently or permanently. The distribution of immune complexes and viral proteins was then analyzed. In transient immunomodulation experiments, the distribution of one or more viral antigens was modified not only in the cytoplasmic membranes but also in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of infected cells. When infected cells were kept permanently in the presence of antibodies, the same pattern of redistribution of immune complexes was observed and the localization of internal viral glycoproteins was significantly modified. However, antibodies did not prevent the lytic effect of infection; they altered neither the infectious virus yield nor the Western immunoblot pattern of viral proteins, suggesting that immunomodulation is not the primary effector of viral persistence.",One of the hypotheses to explain the induction or the maintenance of VZV latency is that it could be promoted by the immune response itself.,"['the_hypotheses', 'the_induction', 'the_maintenance', 'VZV_latency', 'the_immune_response']","['the hypotheses', 'the induction', 'the maintenance', 'VZV latency', 'the immune response']",the hypotheses,the induction,the maintenance,VZV latency,the immune response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies have shown that a candidate SARS vaccine antigen consisting of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike protein can induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals. To optimize expression conditions for scale-up production of the RBD vaccine candidate, we hypothesized that this could be potentially achieved by removing glycosylation sites in the RBD protein. In this study, we constructed two RBD protein variants: 1) RBD193-WT (193-aa, residues 318–510) and its deglycosylated forms (RBD193-N1, RBD193-N2, RBD193-N3); 2) RBD219-WT (219-aa, residues 318–536) and its deglycosylated forms (RBD219-N1, RBD219-N2, and RBD219-N3). All constructs were expressed as recombinant proteins in yeast. The purified recombinant proteins of these constructs were compared for their antigenicity, functionality and immunogenicity in mice using alum as the adjuvant. We found that RBD219-N1 exhibited high expression yield, and maintained its antigenicity and functionality. More importantly, RBD219-N1 induced significantly stronger RBD-specific antibody responses and a higher level of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice than RBD193-WT, RBD193-N1, RBD193-N3, or RBD219-WT.

MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFNβ) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFNβ in bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion.","Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells.","['bats', 'MERS-CoV', 'signs', 'disease', 'the_hypothesis', 'MERS-CoV', 'bat_cells', 'human_cells', 'its_inability', 'antiviral_responses', 'bat_cells']","['bats', 'MERS-CoV', 'signs', 'disease', 'the hypothesis', 'MERS-CoV', 'bat cells', 'human cells', 'its inability', 'antiviral responses', 'bat cells']",bats,MERS-CoV,signs,disease,the hypothesis,MERS-CoV,bat cells,human cells,its inability,antiviral responses,bat cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond their direct functions, they also serve as scaffolds to support the association of proteins involved in structural support, adhesion, and transport. Unfortunately, biological processes sometimes malfunction and require therapeutic intervention. For those processes which occur within or upon membranes, it is oftentimes difficult to study the mechanism in a biologically relevant, membranous environment. Therefore, the identification of direct therapeutic targets is challenging. In order to overcome this barrier, engineering strategies offer a new approach to interrogate biological activities at membrane interfaces by analyzing them through the principles of the interfacial sciences. Since membranes are complex biological interfaces, the development of simplified model systems which mimic important properties of membranes can enable fundamental characterization of interaction parameters for such processes. We have selected the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model viral pathogen to demonstrate how model membrane platforms can aid antiviral drug discovery and development. Responsible for generating the genomic diversity that makes treating HCV infection so difficult, viral replication represents an ideal step in the virus life cycle for therapeutic intervention. To target HCV genome replication, the interaction of viral proteins with model membrane platforms has served as a useful strategy for target identification and characterization. In this review article, we demonstrate how engineering approaches have led to the discovery of a new functional activity encoded within the HCV nonstructural 5A protein. Specifically, its N-terminal amphipathic, α-helix (AH) can rupture lipid vesicles in a size-dependent manner. While this activity has a number of exciting biotechnology and biomedical applications, arguably the most promising one is in antiviral medicine. Based on the similarities between lipid vesicles and the lipid envelopes of virus particles, experimental findings from model membrane platforms led to the prediction that a range of medically important viruses might be susceptible to rupturing treatment with synthetic AH peptide. This hypothesis was tested and validated by molecular virology studies. Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the AH peptide has been identified against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and dengue virus, and many more deadly pathogens. As a result, the AH peptide is the first in class of broad-spectrum, lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents, and has entered the drug pipeline. In summary, engineering strategies break down complex biological systems into simplified biomimetic models that recapitulate the most important parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous for membrane-associated biological processes because model membrane platforms provide more direct characterization of target interactions than is possible with other methods. Consequently, model membrane platforms hold great promise for solving important biomedical problems and speeding up the translation of biological knowledge into clinical applications.",This hypothesis was tested and validated by molecular virology studies.,"['This_hypothesis', 'molecular_virology_studies']","['This hypothesis', 'molecular virology studies']",This hypothesis,molecular virology studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptide alone or fused to TT helper or PADRE to create chimeric peptides was delivered by two mucosal routes (ocular and intranasal) together. Partial protection was found in HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits when peptide was delivered mucosally in the presence of adjuvant. When a subsequent booster of a half dose of the corresponding DNA vaccine was delivered, complete protections were achieved. We conclude that mucosal peptide immunization can be combined with a single DNA vaccination to provide strong protective immunity in rabbits.",Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model was used to test the hypothesis.,"['Our_newly_developed_HLA-A2.1_transgenic_rabbit_model', 'the_hypothesis']","['Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model', 'the hypothesis']",Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model,the hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the subfornical organ, an area lacking the blood brain barrier and sensitive to blood borne angiotensin-II, ACE2 was significantly increased in transgenic mice. Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated in the nucleus of tractus solitarius/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral medulla, when comparing transgenic to non-transgenic mice.

Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive ‘One Health’ interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.

We hypothesized that either exogenous treatment with oxytocin or the presence of the calf at first milking would lead to higher colostrum quantity and higher IgG concentration. The study was conducted from October to December 2017 on a commercial dairy farm in Germany. A total of 567 cows at the time of calving were enrolled, but for the final analyses only 521 animals were considered. The cows were randomly assigned on a daily basis into 1 of 3 groups: (1) control group (n = 177), (2) application of 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. (OXY; n = 163), and (3) presence of the calf (CA; n = 181) before and during milking. Cows in the control and oxytocin group had no contact with their calves after calving and were milked in a separate milking parlor. Cows in the oxytocin group were injected with 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. 3 min before manual stimulation. For cows in the third group, the calf was placed into a calf cart and located in front of the cow 3 min before manipulation of the cow. Colostrum quantity was determined by a digital hanging scale. The colostrum quality was assessed with digital Brix refractometry and ELISA. To evaluate the effect of 2 different treatment procedures, a generalized linear mixed model was constructed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM, Ehningen, Germany). The mean (±SE) colostrum quantity was 4.17 ± 0.30 kg. The treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quantity. Parity, calf birth weight, and calving time affected colostrum quantity. Cows in second parity had the lowest quantity of colostrum (3.74 ± 0.37 kg) compared with cows in parity 1 (4.75 ± 0.34 kg) and cows in parity 3 or greater (4.75 ± 0.38 kg). Cows calving during the night (2200 until 0600 h; 4.93 ± 0.37 kg) had the highest quantity of colostrum compared with cows calving in the morning (0600 until 1400 h; 4.17 ± 0.38 kg) or afternoon (1400 until 2200 h; 4.14 ± 0.34 kg). Regarding colostrum quality, 48% of the colostrum samples contained ≥50 mg of IgG/mL. The mean IgG concentration was 54.6 ± 2.80 mg of IgG/mL. Colostrum quality was affected by the treatment procedures, colostrum quantity, parity, calving time, harvesting time after calving, and the calving day during the week. Both treatment procedures (i.e., OXY with mean IgG concentration results of 57.0 mg of IgG/mL and CA with 56.0 mg of IgG/mL) resulted in higher IgG concentrations in colostrum compared with the control group (50.7 mg of IgG/mL). With increasing colostrum quantity, the colostrum quality decreased in primiparous and multiparous cows. A longer time lag between calving and milking negatively affected the colostrum quality. Concentration of IgG was higher for cows in parity 3 or greater (64.6 ± 2.59 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows in parity 1 (48.5 ± 2.86 mg of IgG/mL) and cows in parity 2 (50.7 ± 2.89 mg of IgG/mL). Cows calving during the night had greater IgG concentrations (60.4 ± 2.92 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows calving in the morning (51.9 ± 2.98 mg of IgG/mL) or afternoon (51.3 ± 2.71 mg of IgG/mL). Harvesting colostrum on quieter days, such as Sundays, resulted in higher IgG concentrations (61.4 ± 3.70 mg of IgG/mL). The assessment by Brix refractometry resulted in a mean result of 26.0 ± 0.20% Brix. Treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quality. A negative association was observed between colostrum quantity and quality in primiparous and multiparous cows determined by Brix refractometry. Brix readings were greater for cows in parity 3 or higher (27.7 ± 0.26% Brix) compared with cows in parity 1 (25.3 ± 0.30% Brix) and cows in parity 2 (25.0 ± 0.32% Brix). In conclusion, the treatment procedure for the first milking is irrelevant to improve the quantity of colostrum.

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV.Author SummaryInfectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.",We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2.,"['MARylation', 'regulates', 'the_proteolytic_function', 'nsP2']","['MARylation', 'regulates', 'the proteolytic function', 'nsP2']",MARylation,regulates,the proteolytic function,nsP2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecules were developed during evolution through natural selection in that they fit many important molecular targets, often receptors, of cells, which are seen in molecules that mimic endogenous neurotransmitters. The chapter discusses that microorganisms and herbivores rely on plants as a food source. Since both have survived, there must be mechanisms of adaptations toward the defensive chemistry of plants. Many herbivores have evolved strategies to avoid the extremely toxic plants and prefer the less toxic ones. Many herbivores have potent mechanisms to detoxify xenobiotics, which allow the exploitation of at least the less toxic plants. In insects, many specialists evolved that are adapted to the defense chemicals of their host plant, in that they accumulate these compounds and exploit them for their own defense. Alkaloids function as defense molecules against insect predators in the examples studied, and this is further support for the hypothesis that the same compound also serves for chemical defense in the host plant. It needs more experimental data to understand fully the intricate interconnections between plants, their alkaloids, and herbivores, microorganisms, and other plants.","Alkaloids function as defense molecules against insect predators in the examples studied, and this is further support for the hypothesis that the same compound also serves for chemical defense in the host plant.","['Alkaloids', 'defense_molecules', 'insect_predators', 'the_examples', 'further_support', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_same_compound', 'chemical_defense', 'the_host_plant']","['Alkaloids', 'defense molecules', 'insect predators', 'the examples', 'further support', 'the hypothesis', 'the same compound', 'chemical defense', 'the host plant']",Alkaloids,defense molecules,insect predators,the examples,further support,the hypothesis,the same compound,chemical defense,the host plant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We were investigated the effects of Q7R on the cytopathic effects (CPE) by CPE reduction assay. Production of DNA fragment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PEDV infection were studied using DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the course of this study it was discovered that Q7R is an extremely potent compound against PEDV. The addition of Q7R to PEDV-infected Vero cells directly reduced the formation of a visible cytopathic effect (CPE). Also, Q7R did not induce DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, ROS increased the infection of PEDV, which was strongly decreased by N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC). However, the increased ROS was not decreased by Q7R. Antiviral activity of antioxidants such as NAC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and the vitamin E derivative, trolox, were hardly noticed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the inhibition of PEDV production by Q7R is not simply due to a general action as an antioxidants and is highly specific, as several other antioxidants (NAC, PDTC, trolox) are inactive against PEDV infection.","On the base of our previous study we were observed relevant studies on the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R), a flavonoid, won't relate ability of its antioxidant.","['the_base', 'our_previous_study', 'relevant_studies', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_antiviral_activity', 'quercetin 7-rhamnoside_(Q7R', 'a_flavonoid', 'ability', 'its_antioxidant']","['the base', 'our previous study', 'relevant studies', 'the hypothesis', 'the antiviral activity', 'quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R', 'a flavonoid', 'ability', 'its antioxidant']",the base,our previous study,relevant studies,the hypothesis,the antiviral activity,quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R,a flavonoid,ability,its antioxidant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro. The X-ray structure of MERS PLpro-∆Ubl2 was determined to 1.9 Å and compared to PLpro containing the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. While the structures were nearly identical, the PLpro-∆Ubl2 enzyme revealed the intact structure of the substrate-binding loop. Moreover, PLpro-∆Ubl2 catalysis against different substrates and a purported inhibitor revealed no differences in catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and inhibition. Further, no changes in thermal stability were observed between enzymes.

Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were, the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination partners.

The role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection has only recently been investigated. Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated. To further define the role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection, chemokine genes such as MIP-1α, RANTES, IP-10, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) have been cloned into RABV genome. It has been found that recombinant RABVs expressing RANTES or IP-10 induce high and persistent expression of these chemokines, resulting in massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and development of diseases and death in the mouse model. However, recombinant RABVs expressing MIP-1α, MDC, as well as GM-CSF further attenuate RABV by inducing a transient expression of chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhancement of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Yet, these recombinant RABVs show increased adaptive immune responses by recruiting/activating dendritic cells, T and B cells in the periphery as well as in the CNS. Further, direct administration of these recombinant RABVs into the CNS can prevent mice from developing rabies days after infection with street RABV. All these studies together suggest that chemokines are both protective and pathogenic in RABV infections. Those with protective roles could be exploited for development of future RABV vaccines or therapeutic agents.","Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated.","['Expression', 'chemokines', 'infection', 'laboratory - adapted , but not_street', 'viruses', 'RABVs', 'expression', 'chemokines', 'the_mechanisms', 'RABV']","['Expression', 'chemokines', 'infection', 'laboratory - adapted , but not street', 'viruses', 'RABVs', 'expression', 'chemokines', 'the mechanisms', 'RABV']",Expression,chemokines,infection,"laboratory - adapted , but not street",viruses,RABVs,expression,chemokines,the mechanisms,RABV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus isolation attempts were carried out on a large panel of different cell types including primary pig kidney cells and lung macrophages, primary rabbit kidney cells and seven established cell lines (MARC-145, ST117, PK15, BHK21, HeLa, Vero, and MDCK). Although these represent cells with susceptibility to a wide range of known viruses, the results did not provide evidence for a specific virus other than PCV2 contributing to the development of PMWS. Furthermore, in order to test whether specific genotypes of PCV2 may trigger the switch from PCV2 infection to clinical disease, we compared complete DNA genome sequences of PCV2 derived from PMWS-positive as well as PMWS-negative pigs. On the basis of the DNA sequences, the PCV2 isolates were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisting of one isolate originating from a herd unaffected by PMWS, with group 2 consisting of nine isolates originating from four PMWS-affected herds, four PMWS-positive pigs plus one unaffected herd. The PCV2 genomes from the two groups showed 95.5% identity. Alignment analyses of the sequences encoding the replicase and capsid protein from group 1 and group 2 PCV2 isolates showed two amino acid differences encoded in the replicase protein, while 19 amino acid differences were predicted among the capsid protein sequences.

Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-β reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-β responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","['These_data', 'the_hypothesis', 'CVB3_infection_hepatocytes', 'important_IFN-I_producers', 'sensors', 'the_murine', 'the_human_system']","['These data', 'the hypothesis', 'CVB3 infection hepatocytes', 'important IFN-I producers', 'sensors', 'the murine', 'the human system']",These data,the hypothesis,CVB3 infection hepatocytes,important IFN-I producers,sensors,the murine,the human system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions.","['Leptospira-infection', 'the_content', 'urine_exosomes', 'these_Leptospira-induced_alterations', 'clues', 'unravel', 'novel_pathways', 'bacterial-host_interactions']","['Leptospira-infection', 'the content', 'urine exosomes', 'these Leptospira-induced alterations', 'clues', 'unravel', 'novel pathways', 'bacterial-host interactions']",Leptospira-infection,the content,urine exosomes,these Leptospira-induced alterations,clues,unravel,novel pathways,bacterial-host interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1–4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1–4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","['the_replicase_proteins', 'spherules', 'a_template']","['the replicase proteins', 'spherules', 'a template']",the replicase proteins,spherules,a template,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its clinical use has been limited by severe toxicity, associated primarily with systemic administration with excess protein distributing freely throughout the body. We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate forms permitting more restricted localization may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity. Here, we have tested the utility of palmitate-derivatized rhIL-2. rhIL-2 was reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide palmitate ester. The resultant lipidated rhIL-2 (pIL-2), when mixed with cells, could spontaneously transfer from solution to cell surfaces. Next, anticancer efficacy of pIL-2 was assessed in two modalities. For adoptive T cell therapy, antitumor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were protein transferred (“painted”) with pIL-2 and injected into mice bearing lymphoma. For in situ therapy, pIL-2 was injected intratumorally into mice bearing melanoma. Tumor growth and IL-2-associated toxicity were determined. RESULTS: In the lymphoma model, painting of the antitumor CTLs with pIL-2 markedly increased their viability and titer. In the melanoma model, intratumoral injection of pIL-2, but not rhIL-2, increased the number of activated CD8(+) T cells (IFN-γ(+)) in the spleen, reduced lung metastasis and prolonged the survival of treated mice. Moreover, while repeated intratumoral injection of rhIL-2 at an excessively high dose (10 injections of 10000 IU/mouse) caused marked vascular leakage syndrome, the same regimen using pIL-2 caused no detectable toxicity.

Theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors. Hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections, and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores. In light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas, our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes. We used ELISA and Western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena Ig epitopes.

Here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps. A large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance DENV infection. Investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to study interactions between DENV and antibodies. These studies indicate that antibody neutralization of DENVs is a “multi-hit” phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion. The most potently neutralizing mouse MAbs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain III of the dengue envelope (E) protein. One challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse MAbs to better understand the human antibody response. The human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different DENV serotypes. Here we review studies conducted with immune sera and MAbs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections. Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion. The leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of FcγR bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis. By understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance DENV, it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines.","Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis.","['results', 'human,_animal_and_cell_culture_studies']","['results', 'human, animal and cell culture studies']",results,"human, animal and cell culture studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may involve overproliferation of alveolar type II cells. In an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, we have shown that the administration of an adenoviral vector overexpressing the 70-kd heat shock protein (AdHSP) limited pathophysiological changes. We hypothesized that this improvement may be modulated, in part, by an early AdHSP-induced attenuation of alveolar type II cell proliferation. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. SETTING: Hadassah-Hebrew University and University of Pennsylvania animal laboratories. SUBJECTS: Sprague-Dawley Rats (250 g). INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via cecal ligation and double puncture. At the time of cecal ligation and double puncture, we injected phosphate-buffered saline, AdHSP, or AdGFP (an adenoviral vector expressing the marker green fluorescent protein) into the trachea. Rats then received subcutaneous bromodeoxyuridine. In separate experiments, A549 cells were incubated with medium, AdHSP, or AdGFP. Some cells were also stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α. After 48 hrs, cytosolic and nuclear proteins from rat lungs or cell cultures were isolated. These were subjected to immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, fluorescent immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alveolar type I cells were lost within 48 hrs of inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This was accompanied by alveolar type II cell proliferation. Treatment with AdHSP preserved alveolar type I cells and limited alveolar type II cell proliferation. Heat shock protein 70 prevented overexuberant cell division, in part, by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of the regulatory retinoblastoma protein. This prevented retinoblastoma protein ubiquitination and degradation and, thus, stabilized the interaction of retinoblastoma protein with E2F1, a key cell division transcription factor. CONCLUSIONS: Heat shock protein 70-induced attenuation of cell proliferation may be a useful strategy for limiting lung injury when treating acute respiratory distress syndrome if consistent in later time points.","We hypothesized that this improvement may be modulated, in part, by an early AdHSP-induced attenuation of alveolar type II cell proliferation.","['this_improvement', 'part', 'an_early_AdHSP-induced_attenuation', 'alveolar_type_II_cell_proliferation']","['this improvement', 'part', 'an early AdHSP-induced attenuation', 'alveolar type II cell proliferation']",this improvement,part,an early AdHSP-induced attenuation,alveolar type II cell proliferation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While over-expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme type 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing hypertension by transforming Angiotensin (Ang)-II into Ang-(1-7), several groups have reported decreased brain ACE2 expression and activity during the development of hypertension. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding results in decreased membrane-bound ACE2 in the brain, thus promoting the development of neurogenic hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we used the DOCA-salt model of neurogenic hypertension in non-transgenic (NT) and syn-hACE2 mice over-expressing ACE2 in neurons. DOCA-salt treatment in NT mice led to significant increases in blood pressure, hypothalamic Ang-II levels, inflammation, impaired baroreflex sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, as well as decreased hypothalamic ACE2 activity and expression, while these changes were blunted or prevented in syn-hACE2 mice. In addition, reduction of ACE2 expression and activity in the brain paralleled a rise in ACE2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of NT mice following DOCA-salt treatment and was accompanied by enhanced ADAM17 expression and activity in the hypothalamus. Chronic knockdown of ADAM17 in the brain blunted the development of hypertension and restored ACE2 activity and baroreflex function.

Some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of MERS-CoV spike (S) is a good candidate antigen for a MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. However, highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic. We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen. Therefore, the immunogenicity of a novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes. Different vaccination regimens were compared in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly (i.m.) with a vaccine containing 10 µg of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD in combination with either aluminium hydroxide (alum) alone, alum and polyriboinosinic acid (poly I:C) or alum and cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). The immune responses of mice vaccinated with RBD, incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and CpG ODN by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route were also investigated. We evaluated the induction of RBD-specific humoral immunity (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity (ELISpot assay for IFN-γ spot-forming cells and splenocyte cytokine production). Our findings indicated that the combination of alum and CpG ODN optimized the development of RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination. Interestingly, robust RBD-specific antibody and T-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rRBD protein in combination with IFA and CpG ODN, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited. Our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes.

However, few studies have examined the differences between wild animals in their natural environments, in which they are typically exposed to a wide array of potential pathogens, and their conspecifics living in captivity. Wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are regularly exposed to myriad pathogens, but there is little evidence of disease-induced mortality in wild hyena populations, suggesting that immune defenses are robust in this species. Here we assessed differences in immune defenses between wild spotted hyenas that inhabit their natural savanna environment and captive hyenas that inhabit a captive environment where pathogen control programs are implemented. Importantly, the captive population of spotted hyenas was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations. Our results show that wild hyenas have significantly higher serum antibody concentrations, including total IgG and IgM, natural antibodies, and autoantibodies than do captive hyenas; there was no difference in the bacterial killing capacity of sera collected from captive and wild hyenas. The striking differences in serum antibody concentrations observed here suggest that complementing traditional immunology studies, with comparative studies of wild animals in their natural environment may help to uncover links between environment and immune function, and facilitate progress towards answering immunological questions associated with the hygiene hypothesis.","Based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis, it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system.","['testing', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', 'microbial_exposure', 'proper_development', 'regulation', 'the_immune_system']","['testing', 'the hygiene hypothesis', 'microbial exposure', 'proper development', 'regulation', 'the immune system']",testing,the hygiene hypothesis,microbial exposure,proper development,regulation,the immune system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, phytol treatment also decreased the autoimmune response and ameliorated both the acute and chronic phases of arthritis. When compared to standard therapies for RA, anti-tumour necrosis factor-α and methotrexate, phytol showed equally good or better therapeutic properties. Finally, phytol mediated its effect within hours of administration and involved modulation of T cell activation, as injection prevented adoptive transfer of disease with arthritogenic T cells.

Most studies addressing virulence factors of B. bronchiseptica utilize isolates derived from hosts other than pigs in conjunction with rodent infection models. Based on previous in vivo mouse studies, we hypothesized that the B. bronchiseptica type III secretion system (T3SS) would be required for maximal disease severity and persistence in the swine lower respiratory tract. To examine the contribution of the T3SS to the pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we compared the abilities of a virulent swine isolate and an isogenic T3SS mutant to colonize, cause disease, and be transmitted from host to host. We found that the T3SS is required for maximal persistence throughout the lower swine respiratory tract and contributed significantly to the development of nasal lesions and pneumonia. However, the T3SS mutant and the wild-type parent are equally capable of transmission among swine by both direct and indirect routes, demonstrating that transmission can occur even with attenuated disease. Our data further suggest that the T3SS skews the adaptive immune response in swine by hindering the development of serum anti-Bordetella antibody levels and inducing an interleukin-10 (IL-10) cell-mediated response, likely contributing to the persistence of B. bronchiseptica in the respiratory tract.

A graft-versus-host-like (GVHL) syndrome, characterized by widespread necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the bowel, skin, and other tissues, has also been observed after mercury treatment of BN rats. These findings have suggested that the autoimmunity caused by the administration of mercury to BN rats may result as a xenobiotic-induced GVHL effect under the control of OX22+ T lymphocytes. However, previous studies of mercury-induced autoimmunity have never reported any evidence of GVHL lesions. Therefore, we have carefully examined various tissues from a large group of BN rats injected with HgCl2 to identify possible areas of inflammatory reactions that may have been unnoticed in previous investigations. In addition, we have determined by flow cytometry whether exposure to mercury results in percentage and numerical alterations of OX22+ or other lymphocyte subpopulations in lymphoid organs of HgCl2-treated BN rats. The present article confirms that mercury induces autoimmune responses to laminin 1 but does not corroborate the hypothesis of a GVHL syndrome regulated by OX22+ lymphocytes. First, changes in OX22+ cells during treatment with HgCl2 were infrequent and had no significant correlation with the kinetics of autoimmune responses to laminin 1.

The mAb KEN-5 was originally reported to recognize rabbit CD5. However, KEN-5 binds almost exclusively to T cells and only to a minor population of B cells. We show here that by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), KEN-5 binds to recombinant rabbit CD5. This interaction is partially inhibited by polyclonal goat anti-CD5 antibody. In addition, immunoprecipitations from lysates of surface biotinylated rabbit lymphocytes with KEN-5 or our anti-CD5 mAb isolate molecules that migrate identically on gels with the same approximate relative molecular mass of 67,000 M(r). By flow cytometric analyses of individual cells from spleen, thymus and appendix, KEN-5 recognizes CD5-like molecules mainly on T cells and on 3-6% of IgM(+) B cells. Immunohistochemical staining of splenic and appendix tissues and confocal immunofluorescent imaging confirm and extend results from flow cytometric analyses. Quantitation of fluorescent colocalization indicates that staining by KEN-5 colocalizes with staining by anti-CD5 on small percentages lymphocytes in splenic tissue sections. As CD5 has both N- and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells. This hypothesis is supported by ELISA data that show that deglycosylation diminishes the binding of KEN-5 to recombinant rabbit CD5. Screening KEN-5 on an array with 406 glycans was inconclusive. Although we did not identify a strongly binding glycan structure, the data are suggestive that the epitope recognized by KEN-5 may be influenced by glycan structures. The epitope this mAb recognizes may either be the glycan itself, or more likely, is influenced by neighboring glycan structure. Our findings suggest that development, selection and function of different B- and T-cell subsets or their preferential survival may be directly or indirectly dependent on different glycan structures associated with CD5 or CD5-like molecules expressed on T cells compared to B cells.","As CD5 has both N- and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells.","['CD5', 'both_N-_and_O-linked_glycosylation', 'differential_binding', 'KEN-5', 'T_cells', 'B-cells', 'different_glycan_structures', 'the_CD5', 'present', 'T', 'B_cells']","['CD5', 'both N- and O-linked glycosylation', 'differential binding', 'KEN-5', 'T cells', 'B-cells', 'different glycan structures', 'the CD5', 'present', 'T', 'B cells']",CD5,both N- and O-linked glycosylation,differential binding,KEN-5,T cells,B-cells,different glycan structures,the CD5,present,T,B cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity.

We hypothesized that the association and intense utilization of the ER during viral replication would induce the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), a signal transduction cascade that acts to modulate translation, membrane biosynthesis, and the levels of ER chaperones. Here, we report that infection by the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) triggers the proximal UPR transducers, as revealed by monitoring the IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP-1 mRNA and the cleavage of ATF6α. However, we detected minimal downstream induction of UPR target genes, including ERdj4, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein, and p58(IPK), or expression of UPR reporter constructs. Translation initiation factor eIF2α is highly phosphorylated during MHV infection, and translation of cellular mRNAs is attenuated. Furthermore, we found that the critical homeostasis regulator GADD34, which recruits protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α during the recovery phase of the UPR, is not expressed during MHV infection. These results suggest that MHV modifies the UPR by impeding the induction of UPR-responsive genes, thereby favoring a sustained shutdown of the synthesis of host cell proteins while the translation of viral proteins escalates. The role of this modified response and its potential relevance to viral mechanisms for the evasion of innate defense signaling pathways during coronavirus replication are discussed.","We hypothesized that the association and intense utilization of the ER during viral replication would induce the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), a signal transduction cascade that acts to modulate translation, membrane biosynthesis, and the levels of ER chaperones.","['the_association', 'intense_utilization', 'the_ER', 'viral_replication', 'the_cellular_unfolded_protein_response', 'UPR', 'a_signal_transduction_cascade', 'translation', 'membrane_biosynthesis', 'the_levels', 'ER_chaperones']","['the association', 'intense utilization', 'the ER', 'viral replication', 'the cellular unfolded protein response', 'UPR', 'a signal transduction cascade', 'translation', 'membrane biosynthesis', 'the levels', 'ER chaperones']",the association,intense utilization,the ER,viral replication,the cellular unfolded protein response,UPR,a signal transduction cascade,translation,membrane biosynthesis,the levels,ER chaperones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-γ synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α/β) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-α, IFN-β or IFN-γ alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-α and IFN-γ or IFN-β and IFN-γ inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-α/β and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression.

Moreover detailed knowledge about these mechanisms and pathways helps to elucidate the molecular causes of various diseases and in defining potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation refers to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent modification of proteins with ADP-ribose and is catalyzed by enzymes of the ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin like, also known as PARP) family as well as some members of the Sirtuin family. Poly-ADP-ribosylation is relatively well understood with inhibitors being used as anti-cancer agents. However, the majority of ARTD enzymes and the ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins are restricted to catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation. Although writers, readers and erasers of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation have been identified only recently, it is becoming more and more evident that this reversible post-translational modification is capable of modulating key intracellular processes and signaling pathways. These include signal transduction mechanisms, stress pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules, and chromatin-associated processes such as transcription and DNA repair.

The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing, etc. The significance of CpG island methylation status in normal development, cell differentiation and gene expression is widely recognized, although still stays poorly understood. METHODS: We performed whole genome DNA methylation array analysis on DNA pool samples from peripheral blood from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy individuals. This technique allowed us to determine the methylation status of 27 627 CpG islands throughout the whole genome in healthy controls and BEN patients. Thus we obtained the methylation profile of BEN patients from Bulgarian and Serbian endemic regions. RESULTS: Using specifically developed software we compared the methylation profiles of BEN patients and corresponding controls and revealed the differently methylated regions. We then compared the DMRs between all patient-control pairs to determine common changes in the epigenetic profiles.

Although glial cells are the principal target of JCV productive infection in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients, little is known regarding the site of JCV persistence and the mechanisms by which the virus spreads to the CNS to cause disease. Previous work has demonstrated the presence of replicating JCV DNA in B lymphocytes from peripheral blood, tonsil, and spleen and it has been hypothesized that lymphocytes may be one site of JCV persistence. Detection of viral gene products in renal tubules and excretion of JC virions in the urine suggests JCV persistence in the kidney. A respiratory route of viral transmission has also been hypothesized implicating the lung as another possible site of persistent JCV infection. Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid is a critical component of the JCV receptor. In this report we examined the tissue distribution of this JCV receptor-type sialic acid in a panel of normal human tissues. Our results demonstrate that in normal brain JCV receptor-type sialic acids are expressed on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, but not on cortical neurons. The receptor-type sialic acid is also more highly expressed on B lymphocytes than on T lymphocytes in normal human spleen and tonsil. In addition, both the kidney and lung express abundant levels of α2-6-linked sialic acids.

It is due to mutations in the influenza virus genetic material creating antigenic drift of pathogenic viral proteins resulting in emergence of new influenza virus strains. Therefore, the vaccines available for prevention of influenza offer no protection against influenza pandemics caused by new virus strains. Moreover, the existing drugs used to combat influenza may be ineffective to treat influenza pandemics due to the emergence of drug resistance in the pandemic virus strain. Therefore, a working strategy must be developed to combat influenza pandemics.

The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic potentials. To test if antigenic drift may contribute to GII.4 persistence, human memory B cells were immortalized and the resulting human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) characterized for reactivity to a panel of time-ordered GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs). Reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns; ancestral (1987–1997), contemporary (2004–2009), and broad (1987–2009). NVB 114 reacted exclusively to the earliest GII.4 VLPs by EIA and blockade. NVB 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary GII.4 VLPs, while NBV 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the GII.4.2006 Minerva strain. Three mAbs had broad GII.4 reactivity. Two, NVB 37.10 and 61.3, also detected other genogroup II VLPs by EIA but did not block any VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands. NVB 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered GII.4 VLPs, as measured by VLP-carbohydrate blockade assays. Using mutant VLPs designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes, two evolving, GII.4-specific, blockade epitopes were mapped. Amino acids 294–298 and 368–372 were required for binding NVB 114, 111 and 43.9 mAbs. Amino acids 393–395 were essential for binding NVB 97, supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation. These data inform VLP vaccine design, provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines, and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","['these_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'GII.4_norovirus_evolution', 'antigenic_variation', 'neutralizing_epitopes', 'antibody', 'receptor', 'switching', 'protective_herd_immunity', 'a_driving_force', 'norovirus_molecular_evolution']","['these data', 'support', 'the hypothesis', 'GII.4 norovirus evolution', 'antigenic variation', 'neutralizing epitopes', 'antibody', 'receptor', 'switching', 'protective herd immunity', 'a driving force', 'norovirus molecular evolution']",these data,support,the hypothesis,GII.4 norovirus evolution,antigenic variation,neutralizing epitopes,antibody,receptor,switching,protective herd immunity,a driving force,norovirus molecular evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mouse model of acute SARS-CoV infection has been helpful in understanding the host response to infection; however, there are still unanswered questions concerning SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We have shown that STAT1 plays an important role in the severity of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and that it is independent of the role of STAT1 in interferon signaling. Mice lacking STAT1 have greater weight loss, severe lung pathology with pre-pulmonary-fibrosis-like lesions, and an altered immune response following infection with SARS-CoV. We hypothesized that STAT1 plays a role in the polarization of the immune response, specifically in macrophages, resulting in a worsened outcome. To test this, we created bone marrow chimeras and cell-type-specific knockouts of STAT1 to identify which cell type(s) is critical to protection from severe lung disease after SARS-CoV infection. Bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that hematopoietic cells are responsible for the pathogenesis in STAT1(−/−) mice, and because of an induction of alternatively activated (AA) macrophages after infection, we hypothesized that the AA macrophages were critical for disease severity. Mice with STAT1 in either monocytes and macrophages (LysM/STAT1) or ciliated lung epithelial cells (FoxJ1/STAT1) deleted were created. Following infection, LysM/STAT1 mice display severe lung pathology, while FoxJ1/STAT1 mice display normal lung pathology. We hypothesized that AA macrophages were responsible for this STAT1-dependent pathology and therefore created STAT1/STAT6(−/−) double-knockout mice. STAT6 is essential for the development of AA macrophages. Infection of the double-knockout mice displayed a lack of lung disease and prefibrotic lesions, suggesting that AA macrophage production may be the cause of STAT1-dependent lung disease. We propose that the control of AA macrophages by STAT1 is critical to regulating immune pathologies and for protection from long-term progression to fibrotic lung disease in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection.","We hypothesized that STAT1 plays a role in the polarization of the immune response, specifically in macrophages, resulting in a worsened outcome.","['STAT1', 'a_role', 'the_polarization', 'the_immune_response', 'macrophages', 'a_worsened_outcome']","['STAT1', 'a role', 'the polarization', 'the immune response', 'macrophages', 'a worsened outcome']",STAT1,a role,the polarization,the immune response,macrophages,a worsened outcome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral nuclear import antagonists, expressed by several highly pathogenic RNA viruses, likely mediate pleiotropic effects on host gene expression, presumably interfering with transcription factors, cytokines, hormones, and/or signaling cascades that occur in response to infection. By bioinformatic and systems biology approaches, we evaluated the impact of nuclear import antagonism on host expression networks by using human lung epithelial cells infected with either wild-type virus or a mutant that does not express ORF6 protein. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in differential gene expression, with approximately twice as many upregulated genes in the mutant virus samples by 48 h postinfection, despite identical viral titers. Our data demonstrated that ORF6 protein expression attenuates the activity of numerous karyopherin-dependent host transcription factors (VDR, CREB1, SMAD4, p53, EpasI, and Oct3/4) that are critical for establishing antiviral responses and regulating key host responses during virus infection. Results were confirmed by proteomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses and in parallel microarray studies using infected primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. The data strongly support the hypothesis that viral antagonists of nuclear import actively manipulate host responses in specific hierarchical patterns, contributing to the viral pathogenic potential in vivo.

Recent evidence suggests that immune suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is mediated by type I IFN; however, it is unclear how type I IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD4(+) Th cell responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that type I IFN signaling directly impairs cDC function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific IFNAR1-deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that type I IFN signaling directly affects cDC function, limiting the ability of cDCs to prime IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells. Although type I IFN signaling modulated all subsets of splenic cDCs, CD8(–) cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced phagocytic and Th1-promoting properties in response to type I IFNs. Additionally, rapid and systemic IFN-α production in response to Plasmodium infection required type I IFN signaling in cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation of type I IFN signaling in CD8(–) splenic cDCs as an approach for enhancing Th1 responses against Plasmodium and other type I IFN–inducing pathogens.","Here, we tested the hypothesis that type I IFN signaling directly impairs","['the_hypothesis', 'type', 'I IFN', 'directly_impairs']","['the hypothesis', 'type', 'I IFN', 'directly impairs']",the hypothesis,type,I IFN,directly impairs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency increases oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arteries, and examined the role of ACE2 in age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction. METHODS: Endothelial function, expression of angiotensin system components, NADPH oxidase subunits, and proinflammatory cytokines were examined in cerebral arteries from adult [12 mo old] and old [24 mo old] ACE2 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. The superoxide scavenger tempol was used to examine the role of oxidative stress on endothelial function. RESULTS: Vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired in adult ACE2 KO [24±6% (mean +/− SE)] compared to WT mice [52±7%, p<0.05]. In old mice, vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired in WT mice [29±6%] and severely impaired in ACE2 KO mice [7±5%]. Tempol improved endothelial function in adult and old ACE2 KO and WT mice. Aging increased mRNA for TNFα in WT mice, and significantly increased mRNA levels of Nox2, p47(phox), and Rcan1 in both ACE2 KO and WT mice. mRNA levels of angiotensin system components did not change during aging.

The interaction between virus and host cells, critical for viral replication, is being extensively investigated by many laboratories. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1. The mechanisms of induction are mediated, at least in part, by signaling pathways such as NFκB and CREB. METHODS: SIRC, VERO, and 293HEK cell lines were infected with HSV-1, and the Egr-1 transcript and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The localization and expression profile of Egr-1 were investigated further by immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. The recruitment of transcription factors to the Egr-1 promoter during infection was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Various inhibitors and dominant-negative mutant were used to assess the mechanisms of Egr-1 induction and their effects were addressed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Western blot analyses showed that Egr-1 was absent in uninfected cells; however, the protein was detected 24-72 hours post treatment, and the response was directly proportional to the titer of the virus used for infection. Using recombinant HSV-1 expressing EGFP, Egr-1 was detected only in the infected cells. ChIP assays demonstrated that NFкB and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were recruited to the Egr-1 promoter upon infection. Additional studies showed that inhibitors of NFкB and dominant-negative CREB repressed the Egr-1 induction by HSV-1 infection. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that Egr-1 is expressed rapidly upon HSV-1 infection and that this novel induction could be due to the NFкB/CREB-mediated transactivation. Egr-1 induction might play a key role in the viral gene expression, replication, inflammation, and the disease progression.","In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1.","['this_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'HSV-1_lytic_infection', 'the_expression', 'important_multi-functional_transcription_factor_Egr1']","['this study', 'the hypothesis', 'HSV-1 lytic infection', 'the expression', 'important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1']",this study,the hypothesis,HSV-1 lytic infection,the expression,important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1- and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K B =(1.1±0.3)×105 M−1).

This has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the naïve, immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced during pregnancy, via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, is critical for piglet protection. However, the anti-PEDV immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis is undefined. We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets. To understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to PEDV, three groups of gilts were orally infected with PEDV in the first, second or third trimester. Control (mock) gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3–5 days postpartum. PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including cytokines, B cells, PEDV antibodies (Abs), and PEDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs and ASCs and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs post PEDV infection. Coinciding with the significantly higher PEDV Ab responses in second trimester gilts, the survival rate of their PEDV-challenged piglets was 100%, compared with 87.2, 55.9, and 5.7% for first, third, and mock litters, respectively. Additionally, piglet survival positively correlated with PEDV IgA Abs and ASCs and VN Abs in milk and PEDV IgA and IgG Abs in piglet serum. Our findings have implications for gestational timing of oral attenuated PEDV maternal vaccines, whereby PEDV intestinal infection in the second trimester optimally stimulated the gut-MG-sIgA axis resulting in 100% lactogenic immune protection in suckling piglets.","We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets.","['a_gestational_window', 'which non-lethal_PEDV_infection', 'pregnant_gilts', 'influences', 'optimal_passive_lactogenic_protection', 'piglets']","['a gestational window', 'which non-lethal PEDV infection', 'pregnant gilts', 'influences', 'optimal passive lactogenic protection', 'piglets']",a gestational window,which non-lethal PEDV infection,pregnant gilts,influences,optimal passive lactogenic protection,piglets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of OMZ on these parameters as well as on respiratory burst activity and oxidative stress marker 8-isprostane was analyzed in unstimulated and co-stimulated PMN by ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), respectively. In unstimulated cells, OMZ induced formation of PGE2, 15(S)-HETE, and LXA4. The levels of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane were not affected, whereas respiratory burst activity was drastically inhibited. In UCP- and OZ-stimulated control cells, all parameters were elevated. Here, OMZ maintained the increased levels of PGE2, 15(S)-HETE, and LXA4, but substantially suppressed levels of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane and inhibited the respiratory burst activity. These findings suggest a switch from the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB4 to the pro-resolving LXA4.

METHODS: Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim. RESULTS: Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe–host interactions, the term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene.

Codon usage bias analysis can reveal much about the molecular evolution and host adaption of ZIKV. To gain insight into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the codon usage pattern in 46 ZIKV strains by calculating the effective number of codons (ENc), codon adaptation index (CAI), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The results from a correspondence analysis (CA) indicate that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between ZIKV and its hosts suggest that ZIKV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from Homo sapiens on the ZIKV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

Desmethylicaritin is a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids in serum. As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition. This study was designed to investigate the effect of desmethylicaritin on adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine was used to test the clonal expansion. Further, the mRNA level and protein expression of adipgenic and related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear location of β-catenin was identified using immunofluoresence assay. Our results showed that desmethylicaritin suppressed the adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, desmethylicaritin inhibited clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Desmethylicaritin did not affect CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ and β mRNA expression, but decreased the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, adipocyte lipid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b that was however down-regulated after adipogenic induction. Desmethylicaritin increased the protein expression of β-catenin both in the cytoplasm and nuclei and immunofluorescence results confirmed that desmethylicaritin increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Above findings implied that desmethylicaritin was able to inhibit adipogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was regulated by desmethylicaritin in the process of suppression of adipogenesis.

A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics.

Here, we investigated anti-HPV-18 E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in a cohort of 23 HPV-18 E6-responsive patients. We found that, although E7-specific CD4(+) T cells were present in all women, a robust T helper type (Th1)/Th2 type response against E7 was associated with HPV-18-negative status, suggesting that indeed these patients might have cleared the virus. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found strong anti-E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in 20% of 24 healthy donors without evidence of disease. In contrast, a robust Th1/Th2 type response against E6 but not E7 correlated with a lack of disease relapse and/or infection recurrence but did not discriminate between HPV-18-positive and HPV-18-negative patients.

Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host–pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called ‘multitask learning’, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A ‘task’ in our scenario is the set of host–pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host–pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex–Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host–pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.

We hypothesized that EMR-based surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past. METHODS: We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. Backgrounds of daily case counts were either synthesized or obtained by applying one of three previously validated ARI case-detection algorithms to authentic EMR entries. From the time of outbreak injection, detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection and background-only time series. The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background+injection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2–4 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling). RESULTS: In otherwise identical surveillance systems, SARIMA detected epidemics sooner than EARS at any FAR below 10%. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility and marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling. Under plausible real-world conditions, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by 5–16 days. It also was more sensitive at detecting the summer wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic. CONCLUSION: Time series modeling of long-term historical EMR data can reduce the time it takes to discover epidemics of ARI.

We hypothesized that the ability of Bordetella bronchiseptica to undergo phenotypic modulation is required at one or more points during the infectious cycle in swine. To investigate the Bvg phase-dependent contribution to pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we constructed a series of isogenic mutants in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate and compared each mutant to the wild-type isolate for its ability to colonize and cause disease. We additionally tested whether a BvgAS system capable of modulation is required for direct or indirect transmission. The Bvg(−) phase-locked mutant was never recovered from any respiratory tract site at any time point examined. An intermediate phase-locked mutant (Bvg(i)) was found in numbers lower than the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, colonization of the respiratory tract and disease caused by the Bvg(+) phase-locked mutant and the wild-type strain were indistinguishable. The Bvg(+) phase-locked mutant transmitted to naïve pigs by both direct and indirect contact with efficiency equal to that of the wild-type isolate.

Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene–induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a “compensation” for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1937","Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults.","['Genetic_variation', 'the_gene_regulatory_landscape', 'thus_gene_expression', 'the_observed_heterogeneity', 'individual_responses', 'exogenous_cellular_insults']","['Genetic variation', 'the gene regulatory landscape', 'thus gene expression', 'the observed heterogeneity', 'individual responses', 'exogenous cellular insults']",Genetic variation,the gene regulatory landscape,thus gene expression,the observed heterogeneity,individual responses,exogenous cellular insults,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen. One of the important virulence characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 is the eaeA gene encoding the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. Intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. RESULTS: Cattle were orally inoculated with either milk (control), milk with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (vector), or milk with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin (vaccinated) on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 98, all calves were challenged orally with E. coli O157:H7 to evaluate whether vaccination with the recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin would reduce the level of E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding. During the first 28 days, vaccinated calves shed both the vector strain and the intimin-expressing S. Dublin strain at a similar level. The vector strain was shed for a significantly longer period as compared to the level of recombinant vaccine strain. Calves that received the intimin-expressed vaccine ceased shedding S. Dublin from day 28 to day 63. All calves were challenged with E. coli O157:H7 on day 98 to determine the effect on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. The amount of E. coli O157:H7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge. We observed a transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the feces in the vaccinated calves. The magnitude of fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal IgA. CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with live attenuated recombinant S.

The function remains obscure and a scattered taxonomical distribution has been reported by numerous groups. METHODS: We have searched GenBank in order to identify all viral accessions that have s2m(−like) sequence motifs. Rigorous phylogenetic analyses and constrained tree topology testing were also performed in order to investigate the apparently mobile nature of s2m. RESULTS: The stem-loop s2m structure can be found in four families of + ssRNA viruses; Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae. In all of these virus families, with the possible exception of Caliciviridae, multiple gains and/or losses of s2m would have to be postulated in order to explain the distribution of this character.

Current chemotherapy for arenavirus infection is limited to the nucleoside analogue ribavirin, which is characterized by considerable toxicity and treatment failure. Using Pichinde virus as a model arenavirus, we attempted to design glycoprotein-derived fusion inhibitors similar to the FDA-approved anti-HIV peptide enfuvirtide. We have identified a GP2-derived peptide, AVP-p, with antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. The 50% inhibitory dose (IC(50)) for the peptide is 7 μM, with complete inhibition of viral plaque formation at approximately 20 μM, and its antiviral activity is largely sequence dependent. AVP-p demonstrates activity against viruses with the Old and New World arenavirus viral glycoprotein complex but not against enveloped viruses of other families. Unexpectedly, fusion assays reveal that the peptide induces virus-liposome fusion at neutral pH and that the process is strictly glycoprotein mediated. As observed in cryo-electron micrographs, AVP-p treatment causes morphological changes consistent with fusion protein activation in virions, including the disappearance of prefusion glycoprotein spikes and increased particle diameters, and fluorescence microscopy shows reduced binding by peptide-treated virus. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements suggest that glycoproteins are destabilized by peptide-induced alterations in viral membrane order. We conclude that untimely deployment of fusion machinery by the peptide could render virions less able to engage in on-pathway receptor binding or endosomal fusion. AVP-p may represent a potent, highly specific, novel therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Because the only drug available to combat infection by Lassa virus, a highly pathogenic arenavirus, is toxic and prone to treatment failure, we identified a peptide, AVP-p, derived from the fusion glycoprotein of a nonpathogenic model arenavirus, which demonstrates antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. AVP-p is unique among self-derived inhibitory peptides in that it shows broad, specific activity against pseudoviruses bearing Old and New World arenavirus glycoproteins but not against viruses from other families. Further, the peptide's mechanism of action is highly novel. Biochemical assays and cryo-electron microscopy indicate that AVP-p induces premature activation of viral fusion proteins through membrane perturbance. Peptide treatment, however, does not increase the infectivity of cell-bound virus. We hypothesize that prematurely activated virions are less fit for receptor binding and membrane fusion and that AVP-p may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection.",We hypothesize that prematurely activated virions are less fit for receptor binding and membrane fusion and that AVP-p may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection.,"['prematurely_activated_virions', 'receptor_binding', 'membrane', 'fusion', 'AVP-p', 'a_viable_therapeutic_strategy', 'arenavirus_infection']","['prematurely activated virions', 'receptor binding', 'membrane', 'fusion', 'AVP-p', 'a viable therapeutic strategy', 'arenavirus infection']",prematurely activated virions,receptor binding,membrane,fusion,AVP-p,a viable therapeutic strategy,arenavirus infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e. initial establishment, expansion, and saturation).

We determined that BanLec inhibits primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates of different tropisms and subtypes. BanLec possesses potent anti-HIV activity, with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar to picomolar range. The mechanism for BanLec-mediated antiviral activity was investigated by determining if this lectin can directly bind the HIV-1 envelope protein and block entry of the virus into the cell. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed direct binding of BanLec to gp120 and indicated that BanLec can recognize the high mannose structures that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody 2G12. Furthermore, BanLec is able to block HIV-1 cellular entry as indicated by temperature-sensitive viral entry studies and by the decreased levels of the strong-stop product of early reverse transcription seen in the presence of BanLec. Thus, our data indicate that BanLec inhibits HIV-1 infection by binding to the glycosylated viral envelope and blocking cellular entry.

Typically, toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. RESULTS: The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all α-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase β-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods, we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains, KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains, such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic, inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life. In prokaryotes HEPN domains are essential components of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) and abortive infection (Abi) systems and in addition are tightly associated with many restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems, and occasionally with other defense systems such as Pgl and Ter. We present evidence of multiple modes of action of HEPN domains in these systems, which include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) in conjunction with other RNase domains (e.g. a novel RNase H fold domain, NamA), suicidal or dormancy-inducing attack on self RNAs (RM systems and possibly CRISPR-Cas systems), and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components (Abi systems). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. We propose that altruistic cell suicide mediated by HEPN domains and other functionally similar RNases was essential for the evolution of kin and group selection and cell cooperation. HEPN domains were repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes and incorporated into several core functions such as endonucleolytic processing of the 5.8S-25S/28S rRNA precursor (Las1), a novel ER membrane-associated RNA degradation system (C6orf70), sensing of unprocessed transcripts at the nuclear periphery (Swt1). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, similar to prokaryotes, HEPN proteins were recruited to antiviral, antitransposon, apoptotic systems or RNA-level response to unfolded proteins (Sacsin and KEN domains) in several groups of eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive sequence and structure comparisons reveal unexpectedly broad presence of the HEPN domain in an enormous variety of defense and stress response systems across the tree of life. In addition, HEPN domains have been recruited to perform essential functions, in particular in eukaryotic rRNA processing. These findings are expected to stimulate experiments that could shed light on diverse cellular processes across the three domains of life.

As they may seriously impact the circulation of certain parasites and the emergence and management of infectious diseases, their study is essential. In the field, detecting parasite interactions is rendered difficult by the fact that a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. To correct for these “false interactions”, methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present paper we propose such a method for presence-absence data (i.e., serology). Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic. The method is termed “the corrected chi-square.” Its robustness was compared to a pre-existing method based on logistic regression and the corrected chi-square proved to be much more robust for small sample sizes. Since the logistic regression approach is easier to implement, we propose as a rule of thumb to use the latter when the ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters is above ten. Applied to serological data for four viruses infecting cats, the approach revealed pairwise interactions between the Feline Herpesvirus, Parvovirus and Calicivirus, whereas the infection by FIV, the feline equivalent of HIV, did not modify the risk of infection by any of these viruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work therefore points out possible interactions that can be further investigated in experimental conditions and, by providing a user-friendly R program and a tutorial example, offers new opportunities for animal and human epidemiologists to detect interactions of interest in the field, a crucial step in the challenge of multiple infections.","Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic.","['Our_method', 'the_calculation', 'the_expected_frequencies', 'single_and_double_infected_individuals', 'the_independence_hypothesis', 'the_observed_ones']","['Our method', 'the calculation', 'the expected frequencies', 'single and double infected individuals', 'the independence hypothesis', 'the observed ones']",Our method,the calculation,the expected frequencies,single and double infected individuals,the independence hypothesis,the observed ones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus takes advantage of the host-RNA-processing machinery to provide the alternative splicing capability necessary for the expression of this proteomic diversity. Serine–arginine-rich (SR) proteins and the kinases that activate them are central to this alternative splicing machinery. In studies reported here, we use the HIV genome as a model. We show that HIV expression decreases overall SR protein/activity. However, we also show that HIV expression is significantly increased (20-fold) when one of the SR proteins, SRp75 is phosphorylated by SR protein kinase (SRPK)2. Thus, inhibitors of SRPK2 and perhaps of functionally related kinases, such as SRPK1, could be useful antiviral agents. Here, we develop this hypothesis and show that HIV expression down-regulates SR proteins in Flp-In293 cells, resulting in only low-level HIV expression in these cells. However, increasing SRPK2 function up-regulates HIV expression. In addition, we introduce SR protein phosphorylation inhibitor 340 (SRPIN340), which preferentially inhibits SRPK1 and SRPK2 and down-regulates SRp75. Although an isonicotinamide compound, SPRIN340 (or its derivatives) remain to be optimized for better specificity and lower cytotoxicity, we show here that SRPIN340 suppresses propagation of Sindbis virus in plaque assay and variably suppresses HIV production. Thus, we show that SRPK, a well known kinase in the cellular RNA-processing machinery, is used by at least some viruses for propagation and hence suggest that SRPIN340 or its derivatives may be useful for curbing viral diseases.","Here, we develop this hypothesis and show that HIV expression down-regulates","['HIV', 'expression']","['HIV', 'expression']",HIV,expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors, including PPARα, and to a lesser degree PPARβ and PPARγ1. How these transcription factors are regulated in the heart is largely unknown. Recent studies have described post-translational ubiquitination of PPARs as ways in which PPAR activity is inhibited in cancer. However, specific mechanisms in the heart have not previously been described. Recent studies have implicated the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger-2 (MuRF2) in inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor SRF. Initial studies of MuRF2−/− hearts revealed enhanced PPAR activity, leading to the hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR activity by post-translational ubiquitination. METHODS: MuRF2−/− mice were challenged with a 26-week 60% fat diet designed to simulate obesity-mediated insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice were followed by conscious echocardiography, blood glucose, tissue triglyceride, glycogen levels, immunoblot analysis of intracellular signaling, heart and skeletal muscle morphometrics, and PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ1-regulated mRNA expression. RESULTS: MuRF2 protein levels increase ~20% during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet. Compared to littermate wildtype hearts, MuRF2−/− hearts exhibit an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by an early onset systolic dysfunction, larger left ventricular mass, and higher heart weight. MuRF2−/− hearts had significantly increased PPARα- and PPARγ1-regulated gene expression by RT-qPCR, consistent with MuRF2’s regulation of these transcription factors in vivo. Mechanistically, MuRF2 mono-ubiquitinated PPARα and PPARγ1 in vitro, consistent with its non-degradatory role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, increasing MuRF2:PPARγ1 (>5:1) beyond physiological levels drove poly-ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PPARγ1 in vitro, indicating large MuRF2 increases may lead to PPAR degradation if found in other disease states. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in MuRF2 have been described to contribute to the severity of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study suggests that the lack of MuRF2, as found in these patients, can result in an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy. These studies also identify MuRF2 as the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate cardiac PPARα and PPARγ1 activities in vivo via post-translational modification without degradation.

Previously, we showed that SARS-CoV PLpro processes the replicase polyprotein at three conserved cleavage sites. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a 316-amino-acid catalytic core domain of PLpro that can efficiently cleave replicase substrates in trans-cleavage assays and peptide substrates in fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based protease assays. We performed bioinformatics analysis on 16 papain-like protease domains from nine different coronaviruses and identified a putative catalytic triad (Cys1651-His1812-Asp1826) and zinc-binding site. Mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp1826 and the four cysteine residues involved in zinc binding are essential for SARS-CoV PLpro activity. Molecular modeling of SARS-CoV PLpro suggested that this catalytic core may also have deubiquitinating activity. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro by two independent assays. SARS CoV-PLpro hydrolyzed both diubiquitin and ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrates, and hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC is approximately 180-fold more efficient than hydrolysis of a peptide substrate that mimics the PLpro replicase recognition sequence. To investigate the critical determinants recognized by PLpro, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the P6 to P2′ residues at each of the three PLpro cleavage sites. We found that PLpro recognizes the consensus cleavage sequence LXGG, which is also the consensus sequence recognized by cellular deubiquitinating enzymes.

The HIV frameshift site consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) followed by a spacer region and a downstream RNA stem–loop structure. Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the −1 frameshift. The stem–loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3–4 bp in the stem–loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","['the_role', 'the_surrounding_genomic_secondary_structure', 'a_modest_impact', 'frameshift_efficiency', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_genomic_secondary_structure', 'frameshifting', 'the_overall_rate', 'translation']","['the role', 'the surrounding genomic secondary structure', 'a modest impact', 'frameshift efficiency', 'the hypothesis', 'the genomic secondary structure', 'frameshifting', 'the overall rate', 'translation']",the role,the surrounding genomic secondary structure,a modest impact,frameshift efficiency,the hypothesis,the genomic secondary structure,frameshifting,the overall rate,translation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we could alter the rate of attachment/infection initiation by increasing or decreasing the density of the cell culture medium.

Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.","In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples.","['contrast', 'our_hypothesis', 'anthropogenic_habitat_disturbance', 'corona-_and_astrovirus_detection_rates', 'fecal_samples']","['contrast', 'our hypothesis', 'anthropogenic habitat disturbance', 'corona- and astrovirus detection rates', 'fecal samples']",contrast,our hypothesis,anthropogenic habitat disturbance,corona- and astrovirus detection rates,fecal samples,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Directed evolution experiments, which combine in vitro mutation and recombination protocols with in vitro or in vivo selection, have proved to be an effective approach for improving functionality of nucleic acids and enzymes. As this approach allows extreme control over evolutionary conditions and parameters, it also facilitates the detection of small or position-specific recombination benefits and benefits associated with recombination between highly divergent genotypes.

There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed.

It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n = 6) and B (n = 4) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n = 83). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway.

Since a similar nsp1 coding region appears in all characterized groups 1 and 2 coronavirus DI RNAs and must be translated in cis for BCoV DI RNA replication, we hypothesized that nsp1 might regulate ORF 1 expression by binding this intra-nsp1 cistronic element. Here, we (i) establish by mutation analysis that the 72-nt intracistronic SLV immediately upstream of SLVI is also a DI RNA cis-replication signal, (ii) show by gel shift and UV-cross-linking analyses that cellular proteins of ∼60 and 100 kDa, but not viral proteins, bind SLV and SLVI, (SLV-VI) and (iii) demonstrate by gel shift analysis that nsp1 purified from Escherichia coli does not bind SLV-VI but does bind three 5′ untranslated region (UTR)- and one 3′ UTR-located cis-replication SLs. Notably, nsp1 specifically binds SLIII and its flanking sequences in the 5′ UTR with ∼2.5 μM affinity. Additionally, under conditions enabling expression of nsp1 from DI RNA-encoded subgenomic mRNA, DI RNA levels were greatly reduced, but there was only a slight transient reduction in viral RNA levels.

Many strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have distinct, S-dependent organ and tissue tropisms despite using a common receptor, suggesting that they employ different cellular proteases for fusion. In support of this hypothesis, we found that inhibition of endosomal acidification only modestly decreased entry, and overexpression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 greatly enhanced entry, of the highly neurovirulent MHV strain JHM.SD relative to their effects on the reference strain, A59. However, TMPRSS2 overexpression decreased MHV structural protein expression, release of infectious particles, and syncytium formation, and endogenous serine protease activity did not contribute greatly to infection. We therefore investigated the importance of other classes of cellular proteases and found that inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- and a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-family zinc metalloproteases markedly decreased both entry and cell-cell fusion. Suppression of virus by metalloprotease inhibition varied among tested cell lines and MHV S proteins, suggesting a role for metalloprotease use in strain-dependent tropism. We conclude that zinc metalloproteases must be considered potential contributors to coronavirus fusion. IMPORTANCE The family Coronaviridae includes viruses that cause two emerging diseases of humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as a number of important animal pathogens. Because coronaviruses depend on host protease-mediated cleavage of their S proteins for entry, a number of protease inhibitors have been proposed as antiviral agents. However, it is unclear which proteases mediate in vivo infection. For example, SARS-CoV infection of cultured cells depends on endosomal acid pH-dependent proteases rather than on the cell surface acid pH-independent serine protease TMPRSS2, but Zhou et al. (Antiviral Res 116:76–84, 2015, doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011) found that a serine protease inhibitor was more protective than a cathepsin inhibitor in SARS-CoV-infected mice.

The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools.

There is no effective treatment for ARDS/ALI. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) through Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-generated Angiotensin II contributes to lung injury. ACE2, a recently discovered ACE homologue, acts as a negative regulator of the RAS and counterbalances the function of ACE. We hypothesized that ACE2 prevents Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury. Fourteen to 16-week-old ACE2 knockout mice—male (ACE2(−/y)) and female (ACE2(−/−))—and age-matched wild-type (WT) male mice received intratracheal BLM (1.5U/kg). Male ACE2(−/y) BLM injured mice exhibited poorer exercise capacity, worse lung function and exacerbated lung fibrosis and collagen deposition compared with WT. These changes were associated with increased expression of the profibrotic genes α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Transforming Growth Factor ß1. Compared with ACE2(−/y) exposed to BLM, ACE2(−/−) exhibited better lung function and architecture and decreased collagen deposition. Treatment with intraperitoneal recombinant human (rh) ACE2 (2 mg/kg) for 21 days improved survival, exercise capacity, and lung function and decreased lung inflammation and fibrosis in male BLM-WT mice. Female BLM WT mice had mild fibrosis and displayed a possible compensatory upregulation of the AT2 receptor.

We hypothesized that a combination of inflammatory markers would differentiate between severe and mild disease in RSV-infected children. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal samples from 52 RSV-infected children were collected during acute infection and after recovery. Retrospectively, patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity: mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Clinical data, number of flow-defined leukocyte subsets, and cytokine concentrations were compared. RESULTS: Children with severe RSV infection were characterized by young age; lymphocytopenia; increased interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-6 concentrations; and decreased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL-5) concentrations in plasma. The combination of plasma levels of IL-8 and CCL-5, and CD4(+) T-cell counts, with cutoff values of 67 pg/ml, 13 ng/ml, and 2.3 × 10(6)/ml, respectively, discriminated severe from mild RSV infection with 82% sensitivity and 96% specificity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the combination of CD4(+) T-cell counts and IL-8 and CCL-5 plasma concentrations correlates with disease severity in RSV-infected children.

However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.","The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome.","['The_primary_purpose', 'this_study', 'well-known_enteric_pathogens', 'outbreaks', 'neonatal_diarrhoea', 'a_new_syndrome']","['The primary purpose', 'this study', 'well-known enteric pathogens', 'outbreaks', 'neonatal diarrhoea', 'a new syndrome']",The primary purpose,this study,well-known enteric pathogens,outbreaks,neonatal diarrhoea,a new syndrome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evolutionary processes promoting cross-species transfers are poorly defined, especially for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In theory, cross species transfers by arboviruses may be constrained by their alternating infection of disparate hosts, where optimal replication in one host involves a fitness tradeoff for the other. Accordingly, freeing arboviruses from alternate replication via specialization in a single host should accelerate adaptation. This hypothesis has been tested by using cell culture model systems with inconclusive results. Therefore, we tested it using an in vivo system with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an emerging alphavirus of the Americas. VEEV serially passaged in mosquitoes exhibited increased mosquito infectivity and vertebrate-specialized strains produced higher viremias. Conversely, alternately passaged VEEV experienced no detectable fitness gains in either host. These results suggest that arbovirus adaptation and evolution is limited by obligate host alternation and predict that arboviral emergence via host range changes may be less frequent than that of single host animal RNA viruses.",This hypothesis has been tested by using cell culture model systems with inconclusive results.,"['This_hypothesis', 'cell_culture_model_systems', 'inconclusive_results']","['This hypothesis', 'cell culture model systems', 'inconclusive results']",This hypothesis,cell culture model systems,inconclusive results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that they are associated with 80 to 85 % of acute attacks of asthma in children, both in mild exacerbations, and in more severe exacerbations leading to hospital admission. The respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses are predominantly detected in infants, while rhinovirus and mycoplasma are the commonest viruses in children. The detailed mechanism of virus-induced exacerbations remains poorly understood, al though recent studies have provided evidence of increased activation of inflammatory cells in bronchial lavage. Allergic individuals, outside of periods of allergy, do not seem to have more virus-induced respiratory manifestations than nonallergic individuals. In contrast, rhinovirus infection may intensify both the immediate and late response to allergen challenge by increasing mast cell mediator release and recruitment of eosinophils in the lower airways. Human and animal studies suggest that local production of cytokines (IL4, IL8, RANTES, MIP-1a...) and the increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in asthmatic individuals, may play an important role for recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in the airways. One hypothesis, that remains to be demonstrated, would be that in the presence of Th2 predominance, as occurs in asthma, an excess of IL4 could inhibit the development of cytotoxic CD8, NK and Th1 activity, thereby resulting in decreased IFN production, more severe allergic inflammation and less efficient viral clearance.","Recent epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that they are associated with 80 to 85 % of acute attacks of asthma in children, both in mild exacerbations, and in more severe exacerbations leading to hospital admission.","['Recent_epidemiologic_studies', 'the_hypothesis', 'acute_attacks', 'asthma', 'children', 'mild_exacerbations', 'more_severe_exacerbations', 'hospital_admission']","['Recent epidemiologic studies', 'the hypothesis', 'acute attacks', 'asthma', 'children', 'mild exacerbations', 'more severe exacerbations', 'hospital admission']",Recent epidemiologic studies,the hypothesis,acute attacks,asthma,children,mild exacerbations,more severe exacerbations,hospital admission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post- and para-acrosomal areas.

Similarly, there are accumulating data suggesting the role of the formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates through bioactivation in herbal toxicity and carcinogenicity. It has been hypothesized that the resultant reactive metabolites following herbal bioactivation covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, leading to toxicity via multiple mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, oncogene activation, and hypersensitivity reactions. This is exemplified by aristolochic acids present in Aristolochia spp, undergoing reduction of the nitro group by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1/2) or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to reactive cyclic nitrenium ion. The latter was capable of reacting with DNA and proteins, resulting in activation of H-ras oncogene, gene mutation and finally carcinogenesis. Other examples are pulegone present in essential oils from many mint species; and teucrin A, a diterpenoid found in germander (Teuchrium chamaedrys) used as an adjuvant to slimming diets. Extensive pulegone metabolism generated p-cresol that was a glutathione depletory, and the furan ring of the diterpenoids in germander was oxidized by CYP3A4 to reactive epoxide which reacts with proteins such as CYP3A and epoxide hydrolase. On the other hand, some herbal/dietary constituents were shown to form reactive intermediates capable of irreversibly inhibiting various CYPs. The resultant metabolites lead to CYP inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. Some examples include bergamottin, a furanocoumarin of grapefruit juice; capsaicin from chili peppers; glabridin, an isoflavan from licorice root; isothiocyanates found in all cruciferous vegetables; oleuropein rich in olive oil; dially sulfone found in garlic; and resveratrol, a constituent of red wine. CYPs have been known to metabolize more than 95% therapeutic drugs and activate a number of procarcinogens as well. Therefore, mechanism-based inhibition of CYPs may provide an explanation for some reported herb-drug interactions and chemopreventive activity of herbs. Due to the wide use and easy availability of herbal medicines, there is increasing concern about herbal toxicity. The safety and quality of herbal medicine should be ensured through greater research, pharmacovigilance, greater regulatory control and better communication between patients and health professionals.","It has been hypothesized that the resultant reactive metabolites following herbal bioactivation covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, leading to toxicity via multiple mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, oncogene activation, and hypersensitivity reactions.","['the_resultant_reactive_metabolites', 'herbal_bioactivation', 'cellular_proteins', 'DNA', 'toxicity', 'multiple_mechanisms', 'direct_cytotoxicity', 'oncogene_activation', 'hypersensitivity_reactions']","['the resultant reactive metabolites', 'herbal bioactivation', 'cellular proteins', 'DNA', 'toxicity', 'multiple mechanisms', 'direct cytotoxicity', 'oncogene activation', 'hypersensitivity reactions']",the resultant reactive metabolites,herbal bioactivation,cellular proteins,DNA,toxicity,multiple mechanisms,direct cytotoxicity,oncogene activation,hypersensitivity reactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that nsp14 ExoN remarkably increases replication fidelity of the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Replacement of conserved MHV ExoN active-site residues with alanines resulted in viable mutant viruses with growth and RNA synthesis defects that during passage accumulated 15-fold more mutations than wild-type virus without changes in growth fitness. The estimated mutation rate for ExoN mutants was similar to that reported for other RNA viruses, whereas that of wild-type MHV was less than the established rates for RNA viruses in general, suggesting that CoVs with intact ExoN replicate with unusually high fidelity. Our results indicate that nsp14 ExoN plays a critical role in prevention or repair of nucleotide incorporation errors during genome replication.

One favored mechanism to explain the role of viruses in the genesis of autoimmunity is molecular mimicry. An immunoinflammatory blinding lesion called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) that follows ocular infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is suggested to result from a CD4(+) T-cell response to a UL6 peptide of HSV that cross-reacts with a corneal autopeptide shared with the immunoglobulin G2a(b) (IgG2a(b)) isotype. The present report reevaluates the molecular mimicry hypothesis to explain HSK pathogenesis. Our results failed to reveal cross-reactivity between the UL6 and IgG2a(b) peptides or between peptide reactive T cells and HSV antigens. More importantly, animals infected with HSV failed to develop responses that reacted with either peptide, and infection with a recombinant vaccinia UL6 vector failed to cause HSK, in spite of generating UL6 reactivity. Other lines of evidence also failed to support the molecular mimicry hypothesis, such as the failure to affect HSK severity upon tolerization of susceptible BALB/c and B-cell-deficient mice with IgG2a(b) or UL6 peptides. An additional study system revealed that HSK could be induced in mouse strains, such as the OT2 × RAG1(−/−) mice (T cell receptor transgenic recognizing OVA(323–339)) that were unable to produce CD4(+) T-cell responses to any detectable HSV antigens.

Differences in the temporal sequence of plasma haptoglobin (p <0.001), apolipoprotein A1 (p<0.001) and transthyretin (p<0.038) were observed between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as was C-reactive protein (p<0.001). In summary, proteomic analysis of plasma and BAL proteins of experimental Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias demonstrates unique protein profiles with principal components and spectral regions that are shared in early infection and diverge at later stages of infection.

This motif is missing from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), resulting in high level of surface expression of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: It has been shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses. One of them is the 3a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo. The 3a protein, which contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization. In addition, 3a can bind to the spike protein and through this interaction, it may be able to cause the spike protein to become internalized, resulting in a decrease in its surface expression. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The effects of 3a on the internalization of cell surface spike protein can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology. IMPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses. The interaction between 3a and S, which are expressed from separate subgenomic RNA, would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of S. The cell surface expression of S in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly, viral spread and viral pathogenesis. Modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.",": If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses.","['this_hypothesis', 'respiratory', 'syndrome', 'coronavirus', 'modulates', 'the_surface_expression', 'the_spike_protein', 'a_different_mechanism', 'other_coronaviruses']","['this hypothesis', 'respiratory', 'syndrome', 'coronavirus', 'modulates', 'the surface expression', 'the spike protein', 'a different mechanism', 'other coronaviruses']",this hypothesis,respiratory,syndrome,coronavirus,modulates,the surface expression,the spike protein,a different mechanism,other coronaviruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fact poses stringent conditions on their transmission mode, demanding, in particular, a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) for successful propagation. The actual advantages of the multipartite viral strategy are as yet unclear. The origin of multipartite viruses represents an evolutionary puzzle. While classical theories suggested that a faster replication rate or higher replication fidelity would favour shorter segments, recent experimental results seem to point to an increased stability of virions with incomplete genomes as a factor able to compensate for the disadvantage of mandatory complementation. Using as main parameters differential stability as a function of genome length and MOI, we calculate the conditions under which a set of complementary segments of a viral genome would outcompete the non-segmented variant. Further, we examine the likeliness that multipartite viral forms could be the evolutionary outcome of the competition among the defective genomes of different lengths that spontaneously arise under replication of a complete, wild-type genome.

Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface displayed L-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis we synthesized a 20-amino acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An L-Rha-cholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetraethylene glycol (TEG) as a linker. The liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the non-immunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting the proposed effect on antigen presentation. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the vaccinated mice serum recognized MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.","Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine.",['a_liposome-based_anti-cancer_vaccine'],['a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine'],a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cytokines elicited by primary and secondary infections seem to exert subtle and sustained effects on behavioral, hormonal, and metabolic axes, and their combined effects on appetite and metabolism have been postulated to drive wasting. However, correlations of increased blood levels of a particular cytokine with wasting in AIDS have not been consistent observations, perhaps because cytokines act principally as paracrine and autocrine hormones, as well as indirectly by activating other systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the catabolic effects of cytokines is clearly needed if more efficacious strategies are to be developed for the prevention and treatment of wasting in AIDS. In this review we first examine the interacting factors contributing to the AIDS wasting syndrome. We then analyze the complex and overlapping role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of this condition, and put forward a number of hypotheses to explain some of the most important features of this syndrome.","We then analyze the complex and overlapping role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of this condition, and put forward a number of hypotheses to explain some of the most important features of this syndrome.","['cytokines', 'the_pathophysiology', 'this_condition', 'a_number', 'hypotheses', 'the_most_important_features', 'this_syndrome']","['cytokines', 'the pathophysiology', 'this condition', 'a number', 'hypotheses', 'the most important features', 'this syndrome']",cytokines,the pathophysiology,this condition,a number,hypotheses,the most important features,this syndrome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region.

We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses.

Colonization of the FHA mutant was lower than that of the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, the PRN mutant caused similar disease severity relative to the wild type; however, colonization of the PRN mutant was reduced relative to the wild type during early and late infection and induced higher anti-Bordetella antibody titers.

We tested the hypothesis that MCP-1 and its receptor CC chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) are essential to the development of experimental HP by treating mice with MCP-1 antibody and using CCR2−/− mice.

CCR2−/− animals responded in a fashion similar to that of wild-type animals to intratracheally administered.S rectivirgula. To determine the influence of the MCP-1–CCR2 interaction in vitro, we transferred S rectivirgula–cultured spleen cells from S rectivirgula–sensitized mice, to naïve recipients. Later, challenge of the recipients with intratracheal S rectivirgula and examination of both lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid characteristics were used to determine whether adoptive transfer had occurred.

Immunosuppression is used to treat AIH and ursodeoxycholic acid is used to slow the progression of PBC. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with both disorders progress to liver failure. Following liver transplantation, up to a third of patients with PBC experience recurrent disease. Moreover a syndrome referred to as “de novo AIH” occurs in a proportion of patients regardless of maintenance immunosuppression, who have been transplanted for disorders unrelated to AIH. Of note, the use of cyclosporine A appears to protect against the development of recurrent PBC and de novo AIH even though it is a less potent immunosuppressive compared to tacrolimus. The reason why cyclosporine A is protective has not been determined. However, a virus resembling mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been characterized in patients with PBC and AIH. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the protective effect of cyclosporine A in liver transplant recipients may be mediated by the antiviral activity of this cyclophilin inhibitor. Treatment of the MMTV producing MM5MT cells with different antivirals and immunosuppressive agents showed that both cyclosporine A and the analogue NIM811 inhibited MMTV production from the producer cells. Herein, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of MMTV-like human betaretrovirus in the development of PBC and de novo AIH and speculate on the possibility that the agent may be associated with disease following transplantation.

Data accumulated by different laboratories suggest their neurotropic potential. For example, primary cultures of human astrocytes and microglia were shown to be susceptible to an infection by the OC43 strain of HuCV (A. Bonavia, N. Arbour, V. W. Yong, and P. J. Talbot, J. Virol. 71:800–806, 1997). We speculate that the neurotropism of HuCV will lead to persistence within the central nervous system, as was observed for murine coronaviruses. As a first step in the verification of our hypothesis, we have characterized the susceptibility of various human neural cell lines to infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen, infectious virus progeny, and viral RNA were monitored during both acute and persistent infections. The astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG, U-373 MG, and GL-15, as well as neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, neuroglioma H4, oligodendrocytic MO3.13, and the CHME-5 immortalized fetal microglial cell lines, were all susceptible to an acute infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen and RNA and release of infectious virions were observed during persistent HuCV-OC43 infections (∼130 days of culture) of U-87 MG, U-373 MG, MO3.13, and H4 cell lines. Nucleotide sequences of RNA encoding the putatively hypervariable viral S1 gene fragment obtained after 130 days of culture were compared to that of initial virus input. Point mutations leading to amino acid changes were observed in all persistently infected cell lines. Moreover, an in-frame deletion was also observed in persistently infected H4 cells. Some point mutations were observed in some molecular clones but not all, suggesting evolution of the viral population and the emergence of viral quasispecies during persistent infection of H4, U-87 MG, and MO3.13 cell lines. These results are consistent with the potential persistence of HuCV-OC43 in cells of the human nervous system, accompanied by the production of infectious virions and molecular variation of viral genomic RNA.","As a first step in the verification of our hypothesis, we have characterized the susceptibility of various human neural cell lines to infection by HuCV-OC43.","['a_first_step', 'the_verification', 'our_hypothesis', 'the_susceptibility', 'various_human_neural_cell_lines', 'infection', 'HuCV-OC43']","['a first step', 'the verification', 'our hypothesis', 'the susceptibility', 'various human neural cell lines', 'infection', 'HuCV-OC43']",a first step,the verification,our hypothesis,the susceptibility,various human neural cell lines,infection,HuCV-OC43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that WEEV activated IRF-3-mediated neuronal innate immune pathways in a replication-dependent manner, and abrogation of IRF-3 function enhanced virus-mediated injury by WEEV and the unrelated flavivirus St. Louis encephalitis virus. Furthermore, IRF-3-dependent neuronal protection from virus-mediated cytopathology occurred independently of autocrine or paracrine type I interferon activity. Despite being partially controlled by IRF-3-dependent signals, WEEV also disrupted antiviral responses by inhibiting pattern recognition receptor pathways. This antagonist activity was mapped to the WEEV capsid gene, which disrupted signal transduction downstream of IRF-3 activation and was independent of capsid-mediated inhibition of host macromolecular synthesis. Overall, these results indicate that innate immune pathways have important cytoprotective activity in neurons and contribute to limiting injury associated with infection by neurotropic arboviruses.","To investigate this hypothesis, we used targeted molecular and genetic approaches with cultured neurons to study cell-intrinsic host defense pathways primarily using the neurotropic alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV).","['targeted_molecular_and_genetic_approaches', 'cultured_neurons', 'cell-intrinsic_host_defense_pathways', 'the_neurotropic_alphavirus_western_equine_encephalitis_virus', 'WEEV']","['targeted molecular and genetic approaches', 'cultured neurons', 'cell-intrinsic host defense pathways', 'the neurotropic alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus', 'WEEV']",targeted molecular and genetic approaches,cultured neurons,cell-intrinsic host defense pathways,the neurotropic alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus,WEEV,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. Objectives We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. Study design During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. Results The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6). Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay.

Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves ≤90 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy- and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen's κ = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between on-farm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement (κ = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement (κ = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.",We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone.,"['dairy_calf_mortality_phenotypes', 'a_systematic_postmortem_analysis', 'cause', 'death', 'diagnoses', 'treatments']","['dairy calf mortality phenotypes', 'a systematic postmortem analysis', 'cause', 'death', 'diagnoses', 'treatments']",dairy calf mortality phenotypes,a systematic postmortem analysis,cause,death,diagnoses,treatments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we discuss the discovery, antiviral activity and mechanism of action of such peptides. While peptide entry inhibitors have been discovered by a wide variety of approaches (structure-based, accidental, intentional, rational and brute force) we show here that they share a common physical chemical property: they are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic and have a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. We propose that this propensity drives a shared mechanism of action for many peptide entry inhibitors, involving direct interactions with viral and cellular membranes, as well as interactions with the complex hydrophobic protein/lipid interfaces that are exposed, at least transiently, during virus–cell fusion. By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Based on this idea, we propose that an approach that focuses on the interfacial hydrophobicity of putative entry inhibitors could lead to the efficient discovery of novel, broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors.

The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication.

The current study characterized a subtype of porcine lung DCs (L-DCs) and investigated the ability of PRRSV to infect and replicate in L-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Furthermore, the type I interferon anti-viral response to PRRSV with and without the addition of recombinant porcine IFN-α (rpIFN-α), an important cytokine that signals for anti-viral mediator activation, was analysed. Results show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, providing evidence that these cells have followed distinct differentiation pathways. Although both cell types responded to PRRSV with an induction of IFN-β mRNA, the magnitude and duration of the response differed between cell types. The addition of rpIFN-α was protective in MDDCs, and mRNA synthesis of Mx (myxovirus resistant) and PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) was observed in both cell types after rpIFN-α addition. Overall, PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, and rpIFN-α was required for the transcription of protective anti-viral mediators.

The nidoviruses are an order of positive-stranded RNA viruses, comprising coronaviruses and arteriviruses, that employ a unique strategy of discontinuous transcription, producing a series of subgenomic mRNAs linking a 5′ leader to distal portions of the genome. For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 has been shown to be able to bind in vitro to the negative strand of the intergenic sequence, a cis-acting element found in the leader RNA and preceding each downstream ORF in the genome. hnRNP A1 thus has been proposed as a host factor in MHV transcription. To test this hypothesis genetically, we initially constructed MHV mutants with a very high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site inserted in place of, or adjacent to, an intergenic sequence in the MHV genome. This inserted hnRNP A1 binding site was not able to functionally replace, or enhance transcription from, the intergenic sequence. This finding led us to test more directly the role of hnRNP A1 by analysis of MHV replication and RNA synthesis in a murine cell line that does not express this protein. The cellular absence of hnRNP A1 had no detectable effect on the production of infectious virus, the synthesis of genomic RNA, or the quantity or quality of subgenomic mRNAs. These results strongly suggest that hnRNP A1 is not a required host factor for MHV discontinuous transcription or genome replication.","To test this hypothesis genetically, we initially constructed MHV mutants with a very high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site inserted in place of, or adjacent to, an intergenic sequence in the MHV genome.","['MHV_mutants', 'a_very_high-affinity_hnRNP_A1_binding_site', 'place', 'an_intergenic_sequence']","['MHV mutants', 'a very high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site', 'place', 'an intergenic sequence']",MHV mutants,a very high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site,place,an intergenic sequence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, CPS-CQ is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to CQ. Chloroquine, an established anti-malarial drug, is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of CQ during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in Plasmodium berghei models. METHODS: A number of experiments in selected complimentary P. berghei murine models in Balb/cByJ and C57BL/6j mice was performed. First, the effect of CQ administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by RAS immunization was studied. Next, the effect of CQ on the induction of circumsporozoite (CS) protein-specific CD8(+) T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites expressing a mutant CS protein was investigated. Finally, a direct comparison of CPS-CQ to CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects, was performed. RESULTS: When CQ was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of RAS, this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory CD8(+) T cells or CS protein-specific CD8(+) T cells. Also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered. Replacement of CQ by MQ for CPS immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of IFNγ producing memory T cells in the liver (p = 0.01), but similar protection. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of CQ on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in P. berghei malaria models. Alternatively, the higher efficiency of CPS compared to RAS might be explained by an indirect effect of CQ through limiting blood-stage exposure after immunization or to increased antigen exposure and, therefore, improved breadth of the immune response.

Rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of naïve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies.

CCR3-siRNA treatments reduced IL-4 stimulated CCL26 release and constitutive CCL24 release by 65% and 80%, respectively. Release of four additional CCR3 agonists RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3 and MCP-4 was also significantly reduced by CCR3-siRNA treatments of the alveolar type II cells.

The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products. One potential source of DRiPs is premature translation termination. If this is a major source of DRiPs, this should be reflected in positional bias towards the N-terminus. By contrast, if downstream initiation is a major source of DRiPs, there should be positional bias towards the C-terminus. Here, we systematically assessed positional bias of epitopes in viral antigens, exploiting the large set of data available in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We show a statistically significant degree of positional skewing among epitopes; epitopes from both ends of antigens tend to be under-represented.

Ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) of negative strand RNA viruses are a prime example where repetition of nucleoprotein (NP) along the genome creates a core polymeric helical scaffold that accommodates other nucleocapsid proteins including viral polymerase. The RNCs are transported through the cytosol for packaging into virions through association with viral matrix proteins at cell membranes. We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging. Previously, we had generated single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) against Filoviruses that have all targeted highly conserved C-terminal regions of NP known to be repetitively exposed along the length of the RNCs of Marburgvirus (MARV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV). Our crosslinker design consisted of dimeric sdAb expressed intracellularly, which we call Xintrabodies (X- for crosslinking). Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers incubated with purified sdAb constructs showed NP aggregation occurred in a genus-specific manner with dimeric and not monomeric sdAb. A virus-like particle (VLP) assay was used for initial evaluation where we found that dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation into VP40-based VLPs whereas monomeric sdAb did not. Inhibition of NP packaging was genus specific. Confocal microscopy revealed dimeric sdAb was diffuse when expressed alone but focused on pools of NP when the two were coexpressed, while monomeric sdAb showed ambivalent partition. Infection of stable Vero cell lines expressing dimeric sdAb specific for either MARV or EBOV NP resulted in smaller plaques and reduced progeny of cognate virus relative to wild-type Vero cells. Though the impact was marginal at later time-points, the collective data suggest that viral replication can be reduced by crosslinking intracellular NP using relatively small amounts of dimeric sdAb to restrict NP packaging. The stoichiometry and ease of application of the approach would likely benefit from transitioning away from intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb to exogenous delivery of antibody. By retuning sdAb specificity, the approach of crosslinking highly conserved regions of assembly critical proteins may well be applicable to inhibiting replication processes of a broad spectrum of viruses.","We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging.","['RNC', 'ideal_targets', 'crosslinkers', 'aberrant_protein', 'protein_interactions', 'their_orderly_transport', 'packaging']","['RNC', 'ideal targets', 'crosslinkers', 'aberrant protein', 'protein interactions', 'their orderly transport', 'packaging']",RNC,ideal targets,crosslinkers,aberrant protein,protein interactions,their orderly transport,packaging,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oligomeric gp140–gp145 from SIVmac251 and SIVsmE660 was purified to homogeneity. Oligomers showed high-affinity interaction with CD4 and were highly immunogenic in rabbits, inducing Tier 2 SIV-neutralizing antibodies. The immunogenicity of an oligomeric Env DNA prime and protein boost together with Advax was evaluated in Chinese rhesus macaques. DNA administration elicited antibodies to both envelopes, and titres were markedly enhanced following homologous protein boosts via intranasal and intramuscular routes. Strong antibody responses were detected against the V1 and V2 domains of gp120. During peak immune responses, a low to moderate level of neutralizing activity was detected against Tier 1A/1B SIV isolates, with a moderate level noted against a Tier 2 isolate. Increased serum antibody affinity to SIVmac251 gp140 and generation of Env-specific memory B cells were observed in the immunized macaques. Animals were subjected to low-dose intravaginal challenge with SIVmac251 one week after the last protein boost. One out of three immunized animals was protected from infection.

Work was carried out in 22 sheep farms, with (i) flock size over 150 animals, (ii) presence of clinical signs of diarrhoea in lambs in the flock and (iii) close and continuous contact and movement of shepherd dogs within the animal shed of each farm. Faecal sample collection from lambs was performed within 48h of onset of clinical signs and prior to administration of any antimicrobial or antiparasitic medication to lambs. Faecal samples were also collected from puppies in the farm. In total, samples were collected from 126 lambs and 58 puppies. Samples were processed by using established techniques for isolation of bacteria, detection of viruses and observation of protozoan oocycts. Escherichia coli isolates obtained during the study, were tested for antimicrobial resistance against a variety of antimicrobial agents. In total, 236 bacterial isolates were recovered from faecal samples of lambs and 165 isolates from faecal samples of puppies. E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism: 104 isolates from lambs and 109 isolates from puppies were recovered. Other bacteria isolated were Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., (lambs and puppies), Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter freundi, Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae (only lambs) and Streptococcus spp. (only puppies). Group A Rotavirus was detected in samples from lambs (2.5%) and Parvovirus in samples from puppies (5%). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in samples from lambs and puppies. This is the first report of isolation of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and of detection of Rotavirus from lambs in Greece. Rates of E. coli isolates from puppies resistant to antimicrobial agents were, in general, smaller than respective rates in isolates from lambs. Two pairs of isolates from the same farm (one from a lamb and one from a puppy) with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected, which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other.","Two pairs of isolates from the same farm (one from a lamb and one from a puppy) with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected, which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other.","['Two_pairs', 'isolates', 'a_lamb', 'a_puppy', 'identical_patterns', 'resistance', 'antimicrobial_agents', 'some_evidence', 'support', 'a_hypothesis', 'members', 'each_pair', 'one_animal_species']","['Two pairs', 'isolates', 'a lamb', 'a puppy', 'identical patterns', 'resistance', 'antimicrobial agents', 'some evidence', 'support', 'a hypothesis', 'members', 'each pair', 'one animal species']",Two pairs,isolates,a lamb,a puppy,identical patterns,resistance,antimicrobial agents,some evidence,support,a hypothesis,members,each pair,one animal species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg2+ significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","['pseudoknots', 'hairpins', 'their_kinetic_insensitivity', 'force', 'the_hypothesis', '−1_frameshifting', 'the_difficulty', 'the_mRNA']","['pseudoknots', 'hairpins', 'their kinetic insensitivity', 'force', 'the hypothesis', '−1 frameshifting', 'the difficulty', 'the mRNA']",pseudoknots,hairpins,their kinetic insensitivity,force,the hypothesis,−1 frameshifting,the difficulty,the mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for IBV. Therefore we hypothesized that early IBV vaccination will generate an immature, poorly protective IBV-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of IBV. To test this hypothesis the IBV-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages. This demonstrated a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the 1, 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower IgA antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group. Similar observations were made for antibodies in tears. In addition, IgG antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds. The delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower IgG avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV field strain challenge. The lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group, while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected.

The main aim was to develop a reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of PRRSV-induced multifactorial respiratory disease. The central hypothesis was that respiratory disease results from an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. In a first series of studies, PRRSV was shown to be a poor inducer of TNF-α and IFN-α in the lungs, whereas IL-1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were produced consistently during infection. We then set up a dual inoculation model in which pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRRSV and 3–14 days later with LPS. PRRSV-infected pigs developed acute respiratory signs for 12–24h upon intratracheal LPS inoculation, in contrast to pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. Moreover, peak TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 titers were 10–100 times higher in PRRSV–LPS inoculated pigs than in the singly inoculated pigs and the cytokine overproduction was associated with disease. To further prove the role of proinflammatory cytokines, we studied the effect of pentoxifylline, a known inhibitor of TNF-α and IL-1, on PRRSV–LPS induced cytokine production and disease. The clinical effects of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), meloxicam and flunixin meglumine, were also examined. Pentoxifylline, but not the NSAIDs, significantly reduced fever and respiratory signs from 2 to 6h after LPS. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1 in the lungs of pentoxifylline-treated pigs were moderately reduced, but were still 26 and 3.5-fold higher than in pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. This indicates that pathways other than inhibition of cytokine production contributed to the clinical improvement. Finally, we studied a mechanism by which PRRSV may sensitize the lungs for LPS. We hypothesized that PRRSV would increase the amount of LPS receptor complex in the lungs leading to LPS sensitisation. Both CD14 and LPS-binding protein, two components of this complex, increased significantly during infection and the amount of CD14 in particular was correlated with LPS sensitisation. The increase of CD14 was mainly due to infiltration of strongly CD14-positive monocytes in the lungs. The PRRSV–LPS combination proved to be a simple and reproducible experimental model for multifactorial respiratory disease in pigs. To what extent the interaction between PRRSV and LPS contributes to the development of complex respiratory disease is still a matter of debate.",The central hypothesis was that respiratory disease results from an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs.,"['The_central_hypothesis', 'respiratory_disease', 'proinflammatory_cytokines', 'the_lungs']","['The central hypothesis', 'respiratory disease', 'proinflammatory cytokines', 'the lungs']",The central hypothesis,respiratory disease,proinflammatory cytokines,the lungs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For both, disease pathogenesis is thought to be immunologically mediated and there have been numerous reports of patients with elevated levels of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), in their sera. Multiple viruses have developed evasion strategies to circumvent the host cell inflammatory process, with one of the most prevalent being the disruption of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. We hypothesized that hantaviruses might also moderate host inflammation by interfering with this pathway. We report here that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of HTNV was able to inhibit TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, as measured by a reporter assay, and the activation of endogenous p65, an NF-κB subunit. Surprisingly, there was no defect in the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) protein, nor was there any alteration in the level of p65 expression in HTNV N-expressing cells. However, immunofluorescence antibody staining demonstrated that cells expressing HTNV N protein and a green fluorescent protein-p65 fusion had limited p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we were able to detect an interaction between HTNV N protein and importin α, a nuclear import molecule responsible for shuttling NF-κB to the nucleus. Collectively, our data suggest that HTNV N protein can sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting NF-κB activity.

Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto “throw away the physics, keep the organisation”. Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M, R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a fundamentally different approach that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature.

It was previously shown that two host cell proteins with molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa bind to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA at approximately 3 to 4 h after infection. We tested the hypothesis that preexisting cellular proteins are modified during the course of infection and are subsequently recruited to play a role in viral replication. It was demonstrated that the 38-kDa protein, either directly or indirectly, is the product of processing by poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase. Only the modified 38-kDa protein, not its precursor protein, has a high affinity for binding to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA. This modification depends on proteolytically active proteinase, and a direct correlation between the levels of 3CD proteinase and the 38-kDa protein was demonstrated in infected tissue culture cells. The nucleotide (nt) 5-10 region (positive-strand numbers) of poliovirus negative-strand RNA is important for binding of the 38-kDa protein. Deletion of the nt 5-10 region in full-length, positive-strand RNA renders the RNA noninfectious in transfection experiments.

We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975–2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = −0.61) and severity (r = −0.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019).

Formulations were optimized to increase antiviral activity, but the antiviral activity of lipidoid-delivered siRNA did not depend on sequence homology to the influenza genome as siRNA directed against unrelated targets also suppressed influenza replication in vivo. This activity was primarily attributed to enhancement of innate immune stimulation by lipidoid-mediated delivery, which indicates increased toll-like receptor (TLR) activation by siRNA. Certain chemical modifications to the siRNA backbone, which block TLR7/8 activation but retain in vitro RNAi activity, prevented siRNA-mediated antiviral activity despite enhanced lipidoid-mediated delivery.

The central mechanisms by which EX reduces this sympathoexcitatory state are unclear, but EX may alter components of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS).

The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids.","['calves', 'moderate_dehydration', 'oral_electrolytes', 'small_volumes', 'intravenous ( IV', 'SC']","['calves', 'moderate dehydration', 'oral electrolytes', 'small volumes', 'intravenous ( IV', 'SC']",calves,moderate dehydration,oral electrolytes,small volumes,intravenous ( IV,SC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (−) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5′-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (−). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5′-UTR, CR-31-B (−) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5′-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.","Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner.","['HEV', 'a_polypurine-free_5′-UTR', 'folds', 'a_stable_hairpin_structure', 'that RNA', 'Silvestrol', 'its_derivatives', 'a_polypurine-independent_but_structure-dependent_manner']","['HEV', 'a polypurine-free 5′-UTR', 'folds', 'a stable hairpin structure', 'that RNA', 'Silvestrol', 'its derivatives', 'a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner']",HEV,a polypurine-free 5′-UTR,folds,a stable hairpin structure,that RNA,Silvestrol,its derivatives,a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that differences in transduction between these two systems were because of an in vivo secreted factor that alter the transduction biology of rAAV1. Indeed, treatment of rAAV1 with ferret airway secretory fluid (ASF) strongly inhibited rAAV1, but not rAAV2, transduction of primary FAE and HeLa cells. Properties of the ASF inhibitory factor included a strong affinity for the AAV1 capsid, heat-stability, negative charge, and sensitivity to endoproteinase Glu-C. ASF-treated rAAV1 dramatically inhibited apical transduction of FAE ALI cultures (512-fold), while only reducing viral entry by 55-fold, suggesting that postentry processing of virus was influenced by the inhibitor factor. Proteasome inhibitors rescued transduction in the presence of ASF (∼1600-fold) without effecting virus internalization, while proteasome inhibitors only enhanced transduction 45-fold in the absence of ASF.

These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac2. However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac2) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac2 from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant.

In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector’s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease’s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.",We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates.,"['the_assumptions', 'underlying these_models', 'vector', 'life', 'important_repercussions', 'R(0)_estimates']","['the assumptions', 'underlying these models', 'vector', 'life', 'important repercussions', 'R(0) estimates']",the assumptions,underlying these models,vector,life,important repercussions,R(0) estimates,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological mechanisms in the eye must be tightly regulated to ensure externally mediated injury and infection or internally mediated autoimmunity do not exceed self-defence tolerance. Vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) and their receptors exist in the mammalian eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process and the retina and may have a role in protecting these normally immune privileged sites. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP pathway. A sound blood supply is essential for retinal survival hence vascular compromise will have serious consequences. Retinal vasculitis is a potentially blinding condition with a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases. Compromise of the endothelial barriers and the blood retina barrier (BRB) may instigate inflammatory responses setting up a chain of events involving VNs in a manner which provokes autoimmunity to them. Protection from BRB breakdown may be linked to nitric oxide (NO) effects and actions of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cAMP production. Induced NO expressed under influences of inflammatory mediators evokes neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis and may lead to serious ocular disease including retinal injury. Other inflammatory mediators also play a role in retinal pathology. PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract and PACAP attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons suggesting that compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability though glutamate toxicity. Additional effects of VN compromise would possibly occur through unopposed vasoconstriction and inflammation. Proof of this hypothesis has important implications for treatment and prevention of autoimmune retinopathy and blindness as a number of therapeutic pathways may be opened. Importantly for therapeutic contexts cAMP effects are maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors which could be used in VN autoimmune disorders. A compelling case may exist to undertake a therapeutic trial of VN replacement, PDE inhibitors and other agents in autoimmune retinopathies resulting from possible VN autoimmunity.",Proof of this hypothesis has important implications for treatment and prevention of autoimmune retinopathy and blindness as a number of therapeutic pathways may be opened.,"['Proof', 'important_implications', 'treatment', 'prevention', 'autoimmune_retinopathy', 'a_number', 'therapeutic_pathways']","['Proof', 'important implications', 'treatment', 'prevention', 'autoimmune retinopathy', 'a number', 'therapeutic pathways']",Proof,important implications,treatment,prevention,autoimmune retinopathy,a number,therapeutic pathways,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When vaccines were available to protect the population against the major epidemics, then chronic, recurrent, or persistent infections came into focus. Viruses are everywhere and all organisms are permanently exposed to them. The result of this contact depends on the particular moment a t which a given cell is exposed to the virus. Rubella, for example, provokes a very benign disease in adults, but can induce abnormalities in the differentiating fetus. Although interferon is active against virus aggression, excess interferon has a toxic effect and can block differentiation. The capacity of several viruses to act as cellular mutagens by modifying chromosomes is well established, whatever the molecular mechanism may be. Mutations at the cellular level were carefully analyzed for their tumorigenic potential.","This chapter examines the effect of viruses in inducing modifications in chromosomes, immune system interactions, and cell metabolism to support such a hypothesis that virus may no longer be present when the pathology appears.","['This_chapter', 'the_effect', 'viruses', 'modifications', 'chromosomes', 'immune_system_interactions', 'cell_metabolism', 'such_a_hypothesis', 'virus', 'the_pathology']","['This chapter', 'the effect', 'viruses', 'modifications', 'chromosomes', 'immune system interactions', 'cell metabolism', 'such a hypothesis', 'virus', 'the pathology']",This chapter,the effect,viruses,modifications,chromosomes,immune system interactions,cell metabolism,such a hypothesis,virus,the pathology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for VEEV infections; therefore, it is imperative to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication. We have shown that at non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib, a FDA-approved inhibitor of the proteasome, proved to be a potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication in the human astrocytoma cell line U87MG. Bortezomib inhibited the virulent Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain and the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV. Additional studies with virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) demonstrated that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the New World alphaviruses. Time-of-addition assays showed that Bortezomib was an effective inhibitor of viral multiplication even when the drug was introduced many hours post exposure to the virus. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the VEEV capsid protein is ubiquitinated in infected cells, which was validated by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequent studies revealed that capsid is ubiquitinated on K48 during early stages of infection which was affected by Bortezomib treatment.

Since then, several bats throughout the world have been shown to shed CoV sequences, and presumably CoVs, in the feces; however, no bat CoVs have been isolated from nature. Moreover, there are very few bat cell lines or reagents available for investigating CoV replication in bat cells or for isolating bat CoVs adapted to specific bat species. Here, we show by molecular clock analysis that alphacoronavirus (α-CoV) sequences derived from the North American tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) are predicted to share common ancestry with human CoV (HCoV)-NL63, with the most recent common ancestor between these viruses occurring approximately 563 to 822 years ago. Further, we developed immortalized bat cell lines from the lungs of this bat species to determine if these cells were capable of supporting infection with HCoVs. While SARS-CoV, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), and chimeric SARS-CoVs bearing the spike genes of early human strains replicated inefficiently, HCoV-NL63 replicated for multiple passages in the immortalized lung cells from this bat species.

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

Although blocking plant virus transmission would allow for crop protection, virus receptors in insect vectors are unknown. Here we identify membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) coat protein (CP) in the gut of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a far-Western blot method. Pulldown and immunofluorescence binding assays and surface plasmon resonance were used to confirm and characterize CP-APN interaction. PEMV virions and a peptide comprised of PEMV CP fused to a proline-rich hinge (-P-) and green fluorescent protein (CP-P-GFP) specifically bound to APN. Recombinant APN expressed in Sf9 cells resulted in internalization of CP-P-GFP, which was visualized by confocal microscopy; such internalization is an expected hallmark of a functional gut receptor. Finally, in assays with aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles, binding of CP-P-GFP competed with binding of GBP3.1, a peptide previously demonstrated to bind to APN in the aphid gut and to impede PEMV uptake into the hemocoel; this finding supports the hypothesis that GBP3.1 and PEMV bind to and compete for the same APN receptor. These in vitro data combined with previously published in vivo experiments (S. Liu, S. Sivakumar, W. O. Sparks, W. A. Miller, and B. C. Bonning, Virology 401:107–116, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.009) support the identification of APN as the first receptor in a plant virus vector. Knowledge of this receptor will provide for technologies based on PEMV-APN interaction designed to block plant virus transmission and to suppress aphid populations. IMPORTANCE A significant proportion of global food production is lost to insect pests. Aphids, in addition to weakening plants by feeding on their sap, are responsible for transmitting about half of the plant viruses vectored by insects. Growers rely heavily on the application of chemical insecticides to manage both aphids and aphid-vectored plant viral disease. To increase our understanding of plant virus-aphid vector interaction, we provide in vitro evidence supporting earlier in vivo work for identification of a receptor protein in the aphid gut called aminopeptidase N, which is responsible for entry of the plant virus pea enation mosaic virus into the pea aphid vector. Enrichment of proteins found on the surface of the aphid gut epithelium resulted in identification of this first aphid gut receptor for a plant virus. This discovery is particularly important since the disruption of plant virus binding to such a receptor may enable the development of a nonchemical strategy for controlling aphid-vectored plant viruses to maximize food production.","Finally, in assays with aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles, binding of CP-P-GFP competed with binding of GBP3.1, a peptide previously demonstrated to bind to APN in the aphid gut and to impede PEMV uptake into the hemocoel; this finding supports the hypothesis that GBP3.1 and PEMV bind to and compete for the same APN receptor.","['assays', 'aphid_gut-derived_brush_border_membrane_vesicles', 'CP-P-GFP', 'binding', 'GBP3.1 , a_peptide', 'APN', 'the_aphid_gut', 'PEMV_uptake', 'the_hemocoel', 'this_finding', 'supports the_hypothesis', 'GBP3.1', 'PEMV', 'the_same_APN_receptor']","['assays', 'aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles', 'CP-P-GFP', 'binding', 'GBP3.1 , a peptide', 'APN', 'the aphid gut', 'PEMV uptake', 'the hemocoel', 'this finding', 'supports the hypothesis', 'GBP3.1', 'PEMV', 'the same APN receptor']",assays,aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles,CP-P-GFP,binding,"GBP3.1 , a peptide",APN,the aphid gut,PEMV uptake,the hemocoel,this finding,supports the hypothesis,GBP3.1,PEMV,the same APN receptor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04).

A preferred method in rats is the implantation of a polyurethane catheter into the jugular vein, with heparinized glycerol as a lock solution. However, analysis of various biologic compounds (for example, microRNA) precludes the use of heparin. We used sodium citrate as an alternative to heparin but observed more frequent loss of catheter patency. We hypothesized that this effect was due to evaporation of lock solution at the exteriorized portion of the catheter, subsequent blood infiltration into the catheter, and ultimately clot formation within the catheter. We therefore tested evaporation and its variables in vitro by using 5 common catheter materials. We used the migration of dye into vertically anchored catheters as a measure of lock displacement due to evaporation. Exposure to dry room-temperature air was sufficient to cause dye migration against gravity, whereas a humid environment and adding glycerol to the lock solution mitigated this effect, thus confirming loss of the lock solution from the catheter by evaporation. We tested 4 catheter treatments for the ability to reduce lock evaporation. Results were validated in vivo by using male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 12) implanted with polyurethane jugular vein catheters and randomized to receive a nitrocellulose-based coating on the exteriorized portion of the catheter. Coating the catheters significantly improved patency, as indicated by a Kaplan–Meier log-rank hazard ratio greater than 5 in untreated catheters. We here demonstrate that a simple nitrocellulose coating reduces evaporation from and thus prolongs the patency of polyurethane catheters in rats.","We hypothesized that this effect was due to evaporation of lock solution at the exteriorized portion of the catheter, subsequent blood infiltration into the catheter, and ultimately clot formation within the catheter.","['evaporation', 'lock_solution', 'the_exteriorized_portion', 'the_catheter', 'subsequent blood infiltration', 'the_catheter', 'ultimately clot', 'formation', 'the_catheter']","['evaporation', 'lock solution', 'the exteriorized portion', 'the catheter', 'subsequent blood infiltration', 'the catheter', 'ultimately clot', 'formation', 'the catheter']",evaporation,lock solution,the exteriorized portion,the catheter,subsequent blood infiltration,the catheter,ultimately clot,formation,the catheter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. RESULTS: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified.

The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from “without” and viral fusion from “within” the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed.

Some strains of LCMV exploit high affinity interactions with α-dystroglycan (α-DG) to bind to cell surfaces and subsequently fuse in low pH endosomes. LCMV strains with low α-DG affinity utilize an unknown receptor and display unique tissue tropisms. We pseudotyped non-primate feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vectors using LCMV derived glycoproteins with high or low affinity to α-DG and evaluated their properties in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We pseudotyped FIV with the LCMV WE54 strain envelope glycoprotein and also engineered a point mutation in the WE54 envelope glycoprotein (L260F) to diminish α-DG affinity and direct binding to alternate receptors. We hypothesized that this change would alter in vivo tissue tropism and enhance gene transfer to neonatal animals. RESULTS: In mice, hepatic α- and β-DG expression was greatest at the late gestational and neonatal time points. When displayed on the surface of the FIV lentivirus the WE54 L260F mutant glycoprotein bound weakly to immobilized α-DG. Additionally, LCMV WE54 pseudotyped FIV vector transduction was neutralized by pre-incubation with soluble α-DG, while the mutant glycoprotein pseudotyped vector was not. In vivo gene transfer in adult mice with either envelope yielded low transduction efficiencies in hepatocytes following intravenous delivery. In marked contrast, neonatal gene transfer with the LCMV envelopes, and notably with the FIV-L260F vector, conferred abundant liver and lower level cardiomyocyte transduction as detected by luciferase assays, bioluminescent imaging, and β-galactosidase staining. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a developmentally regulated receptor for LCMV is expressed abundantly in neonatal mice. LCMV pseudotyped vectors may have applications for neonatal gene transfer.

During the acute phase of infection (first 48 h), minus and plus strands accumulated at the same rate initially, but maximal accumulation of minus strands peaked earlier than that for plus strands, indicating that minus- and plus-strand levels are differentially regulated.

Exposure to IGF-1 enhanced alveolar macrophage macrophages in both groups. Finally, exposing healthy alveolar macrophages to CF BAL fluid decreased bacterial killing, and this was reversed by the addition of IGF-1, while IGF-1 blockade worsened bacterial killing. Our studies demonstrate that alveolar macrophage function is impaired in patients with CF. Reductions in IGF-1 levels in CF contribute to the impaired alveolar macrophage function.

Type 1 cytokine-conditioned ATOC generated cells that spontaneously secreted high levels of IFNγ, but not IL-4. A second exposure to type 1 cytokines further increased IFNγ secretion by these cells, most of which were blasts that expressed the activation markers CD25, CD71, CD86, and CD134. Studies using blocking antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors suggested that both IL-18 and cognate TCR–MHC/ligand interactions were important for activation. Blocking anti-MHC class I plus anti-MHC class II antibodies, neutralizing anti-IL-18 antibody, and the p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor SB203580 each reduced IFNγ production by ∼75–80%. Cyclosporin A, which prevents TCR signaling, inhibited IFNγ production by ∼50%.

Damage‐ and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns contribute to a self‐perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM‐1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐mimicking complexes GF9‐HDL and GA/E31‐HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5‐week alcohol feeding with the Lieber‐DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM‐1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol‐fed mice, and TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM‐1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol‐induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM‐1 signaling. The TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly inhibited macrophage (epidermal growth factor‐like module‐containing mucin‐like hormone receptor‐like 1 [F4/80], clusters of differentiation [CD]68) and neutrophil (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) markers and proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP‐1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α], interleukin‐1β [IL‐1β], macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP‐1α]) at the mRNA level compared to the HDL vehicle. Administration of TREM‐1 inhibitors ameliorated liver steatosis and early fibrosis markers (α‐smooth muscle actin [αSMA] and procollagen1α [Pro‐Col1α]) at the mRNA level in alcohol‐fed mice. However, the HDL vehicle also reduced serum ALT and some cytokine protein levels in alcohol‐fed mice, indicating HDL‐related effects. Conclusion: HDL‐delivered novel TREM‐1 peptide inhibitors ameliorate early phases of inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and activation in the liver and attenuate hepatocyte damage and liver steatosis.

Thirty of these isolates were successfully characterized using molecular tools targeting the most variable spike (S) 1 gene. IBV isolates from this study clustered into three genotypes based on partial S1 gene variability. The majority of the IBV isolates (70%) were Massachusetts (Mass) type, and the rest were either Connecticut (Conn) type or an uncharacterized genotype with genetic characteristics of Mass and Conn types.

The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%).

Failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an 'N-call.' This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA. FINDINGS: We analysed 16 patient mtDNA samples using MitoChip. N-calls by the proprietary GSEQ software were significantly reduced when either of the freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi or sPROFILER was utilized. With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.","This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA.","['re', 'mtDNA_samples', 'Affymetrix', 'MitoChip', 'the_hypothesis', 'N-calls', 'insertions', 'deletions', 'indels', 'mtDNA']","['re', 'mtDNA samples', 'Affymetrix', 'MitoChip', 'the hypothesis', 'N-calls', 'insertions', 'deletions', 'indels', 'mtDNA']",re,mtDNA samples,Affymetrix,MitoChip,the hypothesis,N-calls,insertions,deletions,indels,mtDNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that inactivation of the 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) activity of nsp16 and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein attenuates PEDV yet retains its immunogenicity in pigs. We generated a recombinant PEDV, KDKE(4A), with quadruple alanine substitutions in the catalytic tetrad of the 2′-O-MTase using a virulent infectious cDNA clone, icPC22A, as the backbone. Next, we constructed another mutant, KDKE(4A)-SYA, by abolishing the endocytosis signal of the spike protein of KDKE(4A). Compared with icPC22A, the KDKE(4A) and KDKE(4A)-SYA mutants replicated less efficiently in vitro but induced stronger type I and type III interferon responses. The pathogenesis and immunogenicities of the mutants were evaluated in gnotobiotic piglets. The virulence of KDKE(4A)-SYA and KDKE(4A) was significantly reduced compared with that of icPC22A. Mortality rates were 100%, 17%, and 0% in the icPC22A-, KDKE(4A)-, and KDKE(4A)-SYA-inoculated groups, respectively. At 21 days postinoculation (dpi), all surviving pigs were challenged orally with a high dose of icPC22A. The KDKE(4A)-SYA- and KDKE(4A)-inoculated pigs were protected from the challenge, because no KDKE(4A)-SYA- and one KDKE(4A)-inoculated pig developed diarrhea whereas all the pigs in the mock-inoculated group had severe diarrhea, and 33% of them died. Furthermore, we serially passaged the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant in pigs three times and did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations. The data suggest that KDKE(4A)-SYA may be a PEDV vaccine candidate. IMPORTANCE PEDV is the most economically important porcine enteric viral pathogen and has caused immense economic losses in the pork industries in many countries. Effective and safe vaccines are desperately required but still not available. 2′-O-MTase (nsp16) is highly conserved among coronaviruses (CoVs), and the inactivation of nsp16 in live attenuated vaccines has been attempted for several betacoronaviruses. We show that inactivation of both 2′-O-MTase and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein is an approach to designing a promising live attenuated vaccine for PEDV. The in vivo passaging data also validated the stability of the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant. KDKE(4A)-SYA warrants further evaluation in sows and their piglets and may be used as a platform for further optimization. Our findings further confirmed that nsp16 can be a universal target for CoV vaccine development and will aid in the development of vaccines against other emerging CoVs.",We hypothesized that inactivation of the 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) activity of nsp16 and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein attenuates PEDV yet retains its immunogenicity in pigs.,"['that inactivation', 'the_2′-O-methyltransferase_(2′-O-MTase)_activity', 'nsp16', 'the_spike_protein', 'attenuates PEDV', 'its_immunogenicity', 'pigs']","['that inactivation', 'the 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) activity', 'nsp16', 'the spike protein', 'attenuates PEDV', 'its immunogenicity', 'pigs']",that inactivation,the 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) activity,nsp16,the spike protein,attenuates PEDV,its immunogenicity,pigs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because individually expressed HA, NA, and M2 proteins are targeted to the apical surface of the cell, guided by apical sorting signals in their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, it has been proposed that the polarized budding of influenza virions depends on the interaction of nucleocapsids and matrix proteins with the cytoplasmic domains of HA, NA, and/or M2 proteins. Since HA is the major protein component of the viral envelope, its polarized surface delivery may be a major force that drives polarized viral budding. We investigated this hypothesis by infecting MDCK cells with a transfectant influenza virus carrying a mutant form of HA (C560Y) with a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain. C560Y HA was expressed nonpolarly on the surface of infected MDCK cells. Interestingly, viral budding remained apical in C560Y virus-infected cells, and so did the location of NP and M1 proteins at late times of infection. These results are consistent with a model in which apical viral budding is a shared function of various viral components rather than a role of the major viral envelope glycoprotein HA.",We investigated this hypothesis by infecting MDCK cells with a transfectant influenza virus carrying a mutant form of HA (C560Y) with a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain.,"['this_hypothesis', 'MDCK_cells', 'a_transfectant_influenza_virus', 'a_mutant_form', 'HA_(C560Y', 'a_basolateral_sorting_signal', 'its_cytoplasmic_domain']","['this hypothesis', 'MDCK cells', 'a transfectant influenza virus', 'a mutant form', 'HA (C560Y', 'a basolateral sorting signal', 'its cytoplasmic domain']",this hypothesis,MDCK cells,a transfectant influenza virus,a mutant form,HA (C560Y,a basolateral sorting signal,its cytoplasmic domain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

Experimental evidences were provided for memory maintenance through anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) carrying the internal image of the antigen. In the present work, we describe a structural basis for such memory perpetuation by molecular modeling and structural analysis studies. A three-dimensional model of Ab2 was generated and the structure of the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein H of Rinderpest virus was modeled using the structural template of hemagglutinin protein of Measles virus. Our results show that a large portion of heavy chain containing the CDR regions of Ab2 resembles the domain of the hemagglutinin housing the epitope regions. The similarity demonstrates that an internal image of the H antigen is formed in Ab2, which provides a structural basis for functional mimicry demonstrated earlier. This work brings out the importance of the structural similarity between a domain of hemagglutinin protein to that of its corresponding Ab2. It provides evidence that Ab2 is indeed capable of functioning as surrogate antigen and provides support to earlier proposed relay hypothesis which has provided a mechanism for the maintenance of immunological memory.",Abstract We had earlier proposed a hypothesis to explain the mechanism of perpetuation of immunological memory based on the operation of idiotypic network in the complete absence of antigen.,"['Abstract', 'a_hypothesis', 'the_mechanism', 'perpetuation', 'idiotypic_network', 'the_complete_absence', 'antigen']","['Abstract', 'a hypothesis', 'the mechanism', 'perpetuation', 'idiotypic network', 'the complete absence', 'antigen']",Abstract,a hypothesis,the mechanism,perpetuation,idiotypic network,the complete absence,antigen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected multiple recombination events throughout the genome between wild type viruses and the vaccine strains in all three emergent isolates. Moreover, we found that strain N1/88 was not entirely exogenous, as was previously hypothesised. Rather, it originated from a recombination event involving the VicS vaccine strain. The S glycoprotein genes of N1/88 and N1/03 were known to be genetically distinct from previously characterised circulating strains and from each other, and the original donors of these genes remains unknown. The S1 glycoprotein gene of N1/88, a subgroup 2 strain, shares a high nucleotide identity with the sequence of the S1 gene of the recent isolate N1/08. As the subgroup 2 strains have not been isolated for at least 20 years, it appears likely that an unknown avian coronavirus that was the donor of the S1 glycoprotein sequence of N1/88 in the 1980s is still recombining with IBV strains in the field.","Moreover, we found that strain N1/88 was not entirely exogenous, as was previously hypothesised.","['strain', 'N1/88']","['strain', 'N1/88']",strain,N1/88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease.

Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism in the liver by HCV-encoded proteins during viral infection creates a favorable environment for virus propagation and pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs). One such master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways is the host subtilisin/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) – or site-1 protease (S1P). SKI-1/S1P plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which control expression of the key enzymes of cholesterol and fatty-acid biosynthesis. Here we report the development of a SKI-1/S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor and its application to blocking the SREBP signaling cascade. We demonstrate that SKI-1/S1P inhibition effectively blocks HCV from establishing infection in hepatoma cells. The inhibitory mechanism is associated with a dramatic reduction in the abundance of neutral lipids, LDs, and the LD marker: adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)/perilipin 2. Reduction of LD formation inhibits virus assembly from infected cells. Importantly, we confirm that SKI-1/S1P is a key host factor for HCV infection by using a specific active, site-directed, small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P: PF-429242. Our studies identify SKI-1/S1P as both a novel regulator of the HCV lifecycle and as a potential host-directed therapeutic target against HCV infection and liver steatosis. With identification of an increasing number of human viruses that use host LDs for infection, our results suggest that SKI-1/S1P inhibitors may allow development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals that could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral options with the current standard of care.","In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs).","['this_study', 'cellular_enzymes', 'master_regulators', 'lipid_homeostasis', 'a_powerful_approach', 'a_novel_class', 'broad-spectrum_antivirals', 'infection', 'human_Flaviviridae_viruses', 'hepatitis_C_virus', 'HCV', 'pathogenesis', 'interaction', 'lipid_droplets', 'LDs']","['this study', 'cellular enzymes', 'master regulators', 'lipid homeostasis', 'a powerful approach', 'a novel class', 'broad-spectrum antivirals', 'infection', 'human Flaviviridae viruses', 'hepatitis C virus', 'HCV', 'pathogenesis', 'interaction', 'lipid droplets', 'LDs']",this study,cellular enzymes,master regulators,lipid homeostasis,a powerful approach,a novel class,broad-spectrum antivirals,infection,human Flaviviridae viruses,hepatitis C virus,HCV,pathogenesis,interaction,lipid droplets,LDs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Culling-induced social perturbation of badger populations may lead to unexpected outcomes. We test predictions from the ‘perturbation hypothesis’, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Culling operations did not remove all individuals from setts, with between 34–43% of badgers removed from targeted social groups. After culling, bTB prevalence increased in badger social groups neighbouring removals, particularly amongst cubs. Seventy individual adult badgers were fitted with radio-collars, yielding 8,311 locational fixes from both sites between November 2001 and December 2003. Home range areas of animals surviving within removed groups increased by 43.5% in response to culling. Overlap between summer ranges of individuals from Neighbouring social groups in the treatment population increased by 73.3% in response to culling. The movement rate of individuals between social groups was low, but increased after culling, in Removed and Neighbouring social groups. Increased bTB prevalence in Neighbouring groups was associated with badger movements both into and out of these groups, although none of the moving individuals themselves tested positive for bTB. Significant increases in both the frequency of individual badger movements between groups and the emergence of bTB were observed in response to culling. However, no direct evidence was found to link the two phenomena. We hypothesise that the social disruption caused by culling may not only increase direct contact and thus disease transmission between surviving badgers, but may also increase social stress within the surviving population, causing immunosuppression and enhancing the expression of disease.","We test predictions from the ‘perturbation hypothesis’, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT).","['predictions', 'the_‘perturbation_hypothesis', 'the_impact', 'operations', 'badger_populations', 'movement', 'surviving_individuals', 'the_influence', 'the_epidemiology', 'bTB', 'badgers', 'data', 'two_study_areas', '( RBCT']","['predictions', 'the ‘perturbation hypothesis', 'the impact', 'operations', 'badger populations', 'movement', 'surviving individuals', 'the influence', 'the epidemiology', 'bTB', 'badgers', 'data', 'two study areas', '( RBCT']",predictions,the ‘perturbation hypothesis,the impact,operations,badger populations,movement,surviving individuals,the influence,the epidemiology,bTB,badgers,data,two study areas,( RBCT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the elicitation of b12 or b12-like antibodies in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. B12 is highly divergent from the closest corresponding germline antibody while X5 is less divergent. We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation. In support of this hypothesis we have previously found that a germline-like b12 (monovalent and bivalent scFv as an Fc fusion protein or IgG) lacks measurable binding to an Env as measured by ELISA with a sensitivity in the μM range [1]; here we present evidence confirming and expanding these findings for a panel of Envs. In contrast, a germline-like scFv X5 bound Env with high (nM) affinity. To begin to explore the maturation pathways of these antibodies we identified several possible b12 intermediate antibodies and tested their neutralizing activity. These intermediate antibodies neutralized only some HIV-1 isolates and with relatively weak potency. In contrast, germline-like scFv X5 neutralized a subset of the tested HIV-1 isolates with comparable efficiencies to that of the mature X5. These results could help explain the relatively high immunogenicity of the coreceptor binding site on gp120 and the abundance of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients (X5 is a CD4i antibody) as well as the maturation pathway of X5. They also can help identify antigens that can bind specifically to b12 germline and intermediate antibodies that together with Envs could be used as a conceptually novel type of candidate vaccines. Such candidate vaccines based on two or more immunogens could help guiding the immune system through complex maturation pathways for elicitation of antibodies that are similar or identical to antibodies with known properties.","We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation.","['the_relatively_high_degree', 'specific_somatic_hypermutations', 'binding', 'the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein', '(Env', 'closest germline_antibodies', 'antibodies', 'intermediates', 'the_pathways', 'maturation', 'the_immune_system']","['the relatively high degree', 'specific somatic hypermutations', 'binding', 'the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein', '(Env', 'closest germline antibodies', 'antibodies', 'intermediates', 'the pathways', 'maturation', 'the immune system']",the relatively high degree,specific somatic hypermutations,binding,the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein,(Env,closest germline antibodies,antibodies,intermediates,the pathways,maturation,the immune system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten “challenge” are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs’ range of 15–25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a “grey zone” of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.",We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID.,"['a_familial_inheritance', 'CD', 'CVID']","['a familial inheritance', 'CD', 'CVID']",a familial inheritance,CD,CVID,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America. We demonstrate marked variation in viral communities that was not consistently predicted by a null model of declining community similarity with increasing spatial or genetic distances separating populations. We also find no evidence that larger bat colonies host greater viral diversity. Instead, viral diversity follows an elevational gradient, is enriched by juvenile‐biased age structure, and declines with local anthropogenic food resources as measured by livestock density. Our results establish the value of linking the modern influx of metagenomic sequence data with comparative ecology, reveal that snapshot views of viral diversity are unlikely to be representative at the species level, and affirm existing ecological theories that link host ecology not only to single pathogen dynamics but also to viral communities.","Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America.","['spatial,_demographic_and_environmental_hypotheses', 'viral_richness', 'community_composition', 'populations', 'common_vampire_bats', 'diverse_habitats', 'North,_Central_and_South_America']","['spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses', 'viral richness', 'community composition', 'populations', 'common vampire bats', 'diverse habitats', 'North, Central and South America']","spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses",viral richness,community composition,populations,common vampire bats,diverse habitats,"North, Central and South America",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid α-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8.

Pathological changes in the bladder developed during PBOO are responsible for long-lasting voiding dysfunction in this population despite early surgical interventions. Increasing evidence showed PBOO induces an upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and their transcriptional target genes, and they play a role in pathophysiological changes in the obstructed bladders. We hypothesized that blocking HIF pathways can prevent PBOO-induced bladder dysfunction. PBOO was surgically created by ligation of the bladder neck in male C57BL/6J mice for 2 wk. PBOO mice received intraperitoneal injection of either saline or 17-DMAG (alvespimycin, 3 mg/kg) every 48 h starting from day 1 postsurgery. Sham-operated animals received injection of saline on the same schedule as PBOO mice and served as controls. The bladders were harvested after 2 wk, and basal activity and evoked contractility of the detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) were evaluated in vitro. Bladder function was assessed in vivo by void spot assay and cystometry in conscious, unrestrained mice. Results indicated the 17-DMAG treatment preserved DSM contractility and partially prevented the development of detrusor over activity in obstructed bladders. In addition, PBOO caused a significant increase in the frequency of micturition, which was significantly reduced by 17-DMAG treatment.

Based on the ability of CEACAM1 to initiate lumen formation in human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D culture (Matrigel), we hypothesized that murine CEACAM1 may play a similar role in vasculogenesis. In order to test this hypothesis, murine embryonic stem (ES) cells stimulated with VEGF were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EB) for 8 days (−8–0 d) and transferred to Matrigel in the presence or absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody for an additional 12 days (0–12 d). In the absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody or in the presence of an isotype control antibody, the EB in Matrigel underwent extensive sprouting, generating lengthy vascular structures with well-defined lumina as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. Both the length and architecture of the vascular tubes were inhibited by anti-CEACAM1 mAb CC1, a mAb that blocks the cell–cell adhesion functions of CEACAM1, thus demonstrating a critical role for this cell–cell adhesion molecule in generating and maintaining vasculogenesis. QRT–PCR analysis of the VEGF treated ES cells grown under conditions that convert them to EB revealed expression of Ceacam1 as early as −5 to −3 d reaching a maximum at day 0 at which time EBs were transferred to Matrigel, thereafter levels at first declined and then increased over time. Other markers of vasculogenesis including Pecam1, VE-Cad, and Tie-1 were not detected until day 0 when EBs were transferred to Matrigel followed by a steady increase in levels, indicating later roles in vasculogenesis. In contrast, Tie-2 and Flk-1 (VEGFR2) were detected on day five of EB formation reaching a maximum at day 0 on transfer to Matrigel, similar to Ceacam1, but after which Tie-2 declined over time, while Flk-1 increased over time. QRT–PCR analysis of the anti-CEACAM1 treated ES cells revealed a significant decrease in the expression of Ceacam1, Pecam1, Tie-1, and Flk-1, while VE-Cad and Tie-2 expression were unaffected. These results suggest that the expression and signaling of CEACAM1 may affect the expression of other factors known to play critical roles in vasculogenesis. Furthermore this 3D model of vasculogenesis in an environment of extracellular matrix may be a useful model for comparison to existing models of angiogenesis.","Based on the ability of CEACAM1 to initiate lumen formation in human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D culture (Matrigel), we hypothesized that murine CEACAM1 may play a similar role in vasculogenesis.","['the_ability', 'CEACAM1', 'lumen_formation', 'human_mammary_epithelial_cells', 'Matrigel', 'a_similar_role', 'vasculogenesis']","['the ability', 'CEACAM1', 'lumen formation', 'human mammary epithelial cells', 'Matrigel', 'a similar role', 'vasculogenesis']",the ability,CEACAM1,lumen formation,human mammary epithelial cells,Matrigel,a similar role,vasculogenesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-α, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN-λ (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours.

There are four genetically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization titers varied by as much as ∼19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.",However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain.,"['increased_scrutiny', 'the_role', 'DENV_genotypic_variation', 'protection', 'repeated_infection']","['increased scrutiny', 'the role', 'DENV genotypic variation', 'protection', 'repeated infection']",increased scrutiny,the role,DENV genotypic variation,protection,repeated infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds. When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests.

The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the arterivirus family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate immune response against arterivirus infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of arterivirus RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune signaling, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I.","Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune signaling, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I.","['our_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'arteri-', 'cellular_proteins', 'RLR-mediated_innate_immune_signaling', 'the_deubiquitination', 'RIG-I.']","['our results', 'the hypothesis', 'arteri-', 'cellular proteins', 'RLR-mediated innate immune signaling', 'the deubiquitination', 'RIG-I.']",our results,the hypothesis,arteri-,cellular proteins,RLR-mediated innate immune signaling,the deubiquitination,RIG-I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we queried the PHIS database for all patients with NEC (ICD-9 code of 777.5) over a 13-year period. Sixteen children’s hospitals were studied, and individual institutional and aggregate data were reviewed. Fisher’s Kappa and Bartlett’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to identify periodicity. RESULTS: During the study interval, there were 2,93,076 neonatal admissions, and 4,559 (1.6%) infants were diagnosed with NEC. Statistical analysis demonstrates a periodicity of 6 months in the occurrence of NEC. Fisher’s Kappa was 16.924 and Bartlett’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov was 0.281, which translates to a P value of <0.0001.

These host range mutants replicated efficiently in normally nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2), and to a lesser extent in human breast carcinoma (MCF7) cell lines. Little if any replication was noted in baby hamster kidney (BHK), green African monkey kidney (COS-7), feline kidney (CRFK), and swine testicular (ST) cell lines. By fluorescent antibody (FA) staining, persistent viruses V10B and V30B, isolated at days 38 and 119 days postinfection, also demonstrated very low levels of replication in human HepG2 cells. These data suggest that persistence may rapidly select for host range expansion of animal viruses. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antibody directed against human carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) or with some monoclonal antibodies (Col-1, Col-4, Col-12, and Col-14) that bind human CEA significantly inhibited V51B infection. Under identical conditions, little or no blockade was evident with other monoclonal antibodies (kat4c or Col-6) which also bind the human CEA glycoproteins. In addition, an antibody (EDDA) directed against irrelevant antigens did not block V51B replication. Pretreatment with the Col-4 and Col-14 antibodies did not block Sindbis virus replication in HepG2 cells or MHV infection in DBT cells, suggesting that one or more CEA glycoproteins likely functioned as receptors for V51B entry into human cell lines. To test this hypothesis, the human biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) and CEA genes were cloned and expressed in normally nonpermissive BHK cell lines by using noncytopathic Sindbis virus replicons (pSinRep19). By growth curves and FA staining, human CEA and to a much lesser extent human Bgp functioned as receptors for V51B entry. Furthermore, V51B replication was blocked with polyclonal antiserum directed against human CEA and Bgp. Under identical conditions, the parental MHV strain A59 failed to replicate in BHK cells expressing human Bgp or CEA. These data suggest that MHV persistence may promote virus cross-species transmissibility by selecting for virus variants that recognize phylogenetic homologues of the normal receptor.","To test this hypothesis, the human biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) and CEA genes were cloned and expressed in normally nonpermissive BHK cell lines by using noncytopathic Sindbis virus replicons (pSinRep19).","['this_hypothesis', 'the_human_biliary_glycoprotein', '(Bgp', 'CEA_genes', 'normally_nonpermissive_BHK_cell_lines', 'noncytopathic_Sindbis_virus_replicons', 'pSinRep19']","['this hypothesis', 'the human biliary glycoprotein', '(Bgp', 'CEA genes', 'normally nonpermissive BHK cell lines', 'noncytopathic Sindbis virus replicons', 'pSinRep19']",this hypothesis,the human biliary glycoprotein,(Bgp,CEA genes,normally nonpermissive BHK cell lines,noncytopathic Sindbis virus replicons,pSinRep19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. Methods One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. Results Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality (ρ=.20 and .19, respectively, P<.05) and physical symptoms (ρ=.21 and .19, P<.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (ρ=.33, P<.001) and sick days (ρ=.21, P<.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator.

Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the “LbSapSal” vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T(0)), during the post-vaccination protocol (T(3rd)) and after early (T(90)) and late (T(885)) times following L. chagasi-challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with “LbSapSal” is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-γ) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-β), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after “LbSapSal” immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection.

Attention has been directed towards medicinal plants as these plants have been traditionally used for generations to treat symptoms of numerous diseases. It is established that plants harbour microorganisms, collectively known as endophytes. Exploring the as-yet untapped natural products from the endophytes increases the chances of finding novel compounds. The concept of natural products targeting microbial pathogens has been applied to isolate novel antimycobacterial compounds, and the rapid development of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has significantly increased the need for new treatments against this pathogen. It remains important to continuously screen for novel compounds from natural sources, particularly from rarely encountered microorganisms, such as the endophytes. This review focuses on bioprospecting for polyketides and small peptides exhibiting antituberculosis activity, although current treatments against tuberculosis are described. It is established that natural products from these structure classes are often biosynthesised by microorganisms.

In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the SARS CoVMpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the S3 subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. RESULTS: The one turn α-helix chain (residues 47–54) of the SARS CoVMpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S3 subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of Glu47.

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs non–antibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement.

Varicella is a primary infection that spreads rapidly in epidemics while zoster is a secondary infection that occurs sporadically as a result of the reactivation of previously acquired VZV. Reactivation is made possible by the establishment of latency during the initial episode of varicella. The signature lesions of both varicella and zoster are cutaneous vesicles, which are filled with a clear fluid that is rich in infectious viral particles. It has been postulated that the skin is the critical organ in which both host-to-host transmission of VZV and the infection of neurons to establish latency occur. This hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR(ci)) interacts with VZV in virtually all infected cells, except those of the suprabasal epidermis, in a way that prevents the release of infectious viral particles. Specifically, the virus is diverted in an MPR(ci)-dependent manner from the secretory pathway to late endosomes where VZV is degraded. Because nonepidermal cells are thus prevented from releasing infectious VZV, a slow process, possibly involving fusion of infected cells with their neighbors, becomes the means by which VZV is disseminated. In the epidermis, however, the maturation of keratinocytes to give rise to corneocytes in the suprabasal epidermis is associated uniquely with a downregulation of the MPR(ci). As a result, the diversion of VZV to late endosomes does not occur in the suprabasal epidermis where vesicular lesions occur. The formation of the waterproof, chemically resistant barrier of the epidermis, however, requires that constitutive secretion outlast the downregulation of the endosomal pathway. Infectious VZV is therefore secreted by default, accounting for the presence of infectious virions in vesicular fluid. Sloughing of corneocytes, aided by scratching, then aerosolizes the virus, which can float with dust to be inhaled by susceptible hosts. Infectious virions also bathe the terminals of those sensory neurons that innervate the epidermis. These terminals become infected with VZV and provide a route, retrograde transport, which can conduct VZV to cranial nerve (CNG), dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and enteric ganglia (EG) to establish latency. Reactivation returns VZV to the skin, now via anterograde transport in axons, to cause the lesions of zoster. Evidence in support of these hypotheses includes observations of the VZV-infected human epidermis and studies of guinea pig neurons in an in vitro model system.","This hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR(ci)) interacts with VZV in virtually all infected cells, except those of the suprabasal epidermis, in a way that prevents the release of infectious viral particles.","['This_hypothesis', 'evidence', 'the large cation - independent mannose_6-phosphate_receptor', 'MPR(ci', 'VZV', 'virtually_all_infected_cells', 'the_suprabasal_epidermis', 'a_way', 'the_release', 'infectious_viral_particles']","['This hypothesis', 'evidence', 'the large cation - independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor', 'MPR(ci', 'VZV', 'virtually all infected cells', 'the suprabasal epidermis', 'a way', 'the release', 'infectious viral particles']",This hypothesis,evidence,the large cation - independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor,MPR(ci,VZV,virtually all infected cells,the suprabasal epidermis,a way,the release,infectious viral particles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, long-incubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN.

Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells. Furthermore simulation of this mechanism in vitro might provide an interesting new therapeutic approach against microorganisms.","While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action.","['no_doubt', 'the_myeloperoxidase_system', 'HIV-1', 'an_additional_indirect_mode', 'action']","['no doubt', 'the myeloperoxidase system', 'HIV-1', 'an additional indirect mode', 'action']",no doubt,the myeloperoxidase system,HIV-1,an additional indirect mode,action,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another study2 included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23·7%), diabetes mellitus (16·2%), coronary heart diseases (5·8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2·3%). In a third study,3 of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.4 The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs).4 Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2.5 ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. • View related content for this article If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism. We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.",We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.,"['diabetes', 'hypertension_treatment', 'ACE2-stimulating_drugs', 'the_risk', 'severe_and_fatal_COVID-19']","['diabetes', 'hypertension treatment', 'ACE2-stimulating drugs', 'the risk', 'severe and fatal COVID-19']",diabetes,hypertension treatment,ACE2-stimulating drugs,the risk,severe and fatal COVID-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg “window stage”, active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. METHODS: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used. The “sandwich” therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated. FINDINGS: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally. When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered. A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these “sandwich”-treated mice. Efficient intrahepatic anti-HBV immune responses were also observed in these mice, including the formation of aggregates of myeloid cells with CD8(+)T cells and increased TNF-α, granzyme B production.

In the case of the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of SARS-CoV infection in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease. To elucidate the biogeographic origin of SARS-CoV and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence, we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout Thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences. To this end, RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae was targeted by RT-PCR in non-invasive samples from bats collected in Thailand. Two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species: one Betacoronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus and one Alphacoronavirus in Hipposideros armiger. Interestingly, these viruses from South-East Asia are related to those previously detected in Africa (Betacoronavirus-b) or in Europe (Alphacoronavirus & Betacoronavirus-b). These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human. All reported Betacoronaviruses-b (SARS-CoV group) of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts, which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of Betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families. Moreover, despite its probable pathogenicity, we found that a Betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony. These findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence. The host’s phylogeny, biogeography and behaviour, combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence. Elucidating the common ancestor of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of SARS-CoV.",These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human.,"['These_findings', 'the_origin', 'the_evolutionary_history', 'the_SARS-CoV_group', 'bats', 'the_hypothesis', 'a_Betacoronavirus_spill', 'Hipposideridae', 'Rhinolophidae', 'Rhinolophidae', 'civets', 'Human']","['These findings', 'the origin', 'the evolutionary history', 'the SARS-CoV group', 'bats', 'the hypothesis', 'a Betacoronavirus spill', 'Hipposideridae', 'Rhinolophidae', 'Rhinolophidae', 'civets', 'Human']",These findings,the origin,the evolutionary history,the SARS-CoV group,bats,the hypothesis,a Betacoronavirus spill,Hipposideridae,Rhinolophidae,Rhinolophidae,civets,Human,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence on the viral messenger RNA and is stimulated by a specific structure, downstream of the shift site. While in group M, the most abundant HIV-1 group, the frameshift stimulatory signal is an extended bulged stem-loop, we show here, using a combination of mutagenesis and probing studies, that it is a pseudoknot in group O. The mutagenesis and probing studies coupled to an in silico analysis show that group O pseudoknot is a hairpin-type pseudoknot with two coaxially stacked stems of eight base-pairs (stem 1 and stem 2), connected by single-stranded loops of 2nt (loop 1) and 20nt (loop 2). Mutations impairing formation of stem 1 or stem 2 of the pseudoknot reduce frameshift efficiency, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of these stems restore the frameshift efficiency to near wild-type level.

Indeed, symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the OKN-1/JPN/2013, and were especially pronounced in younger piglets.

Some of the H5N1 and H9N2 virus subtypes induce markedly elevated cytokine levels when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. We previously showed that H5N1/97 hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the detailed mechanisms of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha hyperinduction following influenza virus infections are not known. Negative feedback regulations of cytokine expression play important roles in avoiding overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection. We investigated the roles of protein phosphatases including MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) in modulating p38MAPK activation and downstream TNF-alpha expressions in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac) infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 influenza virus. We demonstrate that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced TNF-alpha production in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. H9N2/G1 induced PP2A activity in PBMac and, with the treatment of a PP2A inhibitor, p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha production were further increased in the virus-infected macrophages. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce the expression of PP2A indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK in virus-infected PBMac. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages.

In an effort to identify biological targets of ACE2 in the lung, we tested its effects on des-Arg(9) bradykinin (DABK) in airway epithelial cells on the basis of the hypothesis that DABK is a biological substrate of ACE2 in the lung and ACE2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute lung inflammation partly through modulating DABK/bradykinin receptor B1 (BKB1R) axis signaling.

The efficiency of these frameshift events determines the ratio of viral Gag to Gag-Pol proteins available for viral particle morphogenesis, and changes in ribosomal frameshift efficiencies can severely inhibit virus propagation. Since ribosomal frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein translation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that agents that affect the different steps in this process may also have an impact on programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We examined the molecular mechanisms governing programmed ribosomal frameshifting by using two viruses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we present evidence that pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a single-chain ribosomal inhibitory protein that depurinates an adenine residue in the α-sarcin loop of 25S rRNA and inhibits translocation, specifically inhibits Ty1-directed +1 ribosomal frameshifting in intact yeast cells and in an in vitro assay system. Using an in vivo assay for Ty1 retrotransposition, we show that PAP specifically inhibits Ty1 retrotransposition, suggesting that Ty1 viral particle morphogenesis is inhibited in infected cells. PAP does not affect programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies, nor does it have a noticeable impact on the ability of cells to maintain the M(1)-dependent killer virus phenotype, suggesting that −1 ribosomal frameshifting does not occur after the peptidyltransferase reaction. These results provide the first evidence that PAP has viral RNA-specific effects in vivo which may be responsible for the mechanism of its antiviral activity.","Since ribosomal frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein translation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that agents that affect the different steps in this process may also have an impact on programmed ribosomal frameshifting.","['ribosomal_frameshifting', 'the_elongation_phase', 'protein_translation', 'agents', 'this_process', 'an_impact', 'programmed_ribosomal_frameshifting']","['ribosomal frameshifting', 'the elongation phase', 'protein translation', 'agents', 'this process', 'an impact', 'programmed ribosomal frameshifting']",ribosomal frameshifting,the elongation phase,protein translation,agents,this process,an impact,programmed ribosomal frameshifting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein.

We have found a novel anti-inflammatory pathway that is initiated by the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), interacting with Fcγ receptor (FcγR) on monocytes. This pathway is protective in animal models of endotoxin shock. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the FcγR might contribute to monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma. METHODS: We conducted an observational study on a prospectively identified cohort of adult patients with convenience enrollment admitted after severe trauma. We enrolled 66 patients and collected blood samples at enrollment and again at 48 and 72 hrs. Patients were followed through their hospital stay and any septic events before 14 days were recorded. Cytokine and CRP levels were determined in the plasma from all three blood draws. Additionally, DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for the 131 H/R FcγRIIa polymorphism that strongly affects the binding of IgG and CRP to this receptor. RESULTS: Elevated levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 MCP-1 as well as CRP were associated with reduced time to post-traumatic sepsis in Cox regression analysis. Expression of monocyte HLA-DR below 45% on patient monocytes was also associated with sepsis (HR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.45-6.93). Genetic analysis found that individuals with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP poorly were also more likely to have decreased monocyte HLA-DR and post-traumatic sepsis. In vitro studies showed that CRP could attenuate monocyte deactivation in volunteers with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a common genetic variation in the FcγRIIa receptor may contribute to infectious susceptibility in trauma patients. In vitro experiments suggest that this association is related to the inability of CRP to bind to this FcγRIIa receptor variant.

Relevant theoretical frameworks remain nascent. PURPOSE: To model associations between trust in information, perceived hygiene effectiveness, knowledge about the causes of influenza, perceived susceptibility and worry, and personal hygiene practices (PHPs) associated with influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional household telephone surveys on avian influenza A/H5N1 (2006) and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) gathered comparable data on trust in formal and informal sources of influenza information, influenza-related knowledge, perceived hygiene effectiveness, worry, perceived susceptibility, and PHPs. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed domain content while confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the extracted factors. The hypothesized model, compiled from different theoretical frameworks, was optimized with structural equation modelling using the A/H5N1 data. The optimized model was then tested against the A/H1N1 dataset. RESULTS: The model was robust across datasets though corresponding path weights differed. Trust in formal information was positively associated with perceived hygiene effectiveness which was positively associated with PHPs in both datasets. Trust in formal information was positively associated with influenza worry in A/H5N1 data, and with knowledge of influenza cause in A/H1N1 data, both variables being positively associated with PHPs. Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry in both datasets. Independent of information trust, perceived influenza susceptibility associated with influenza worry.

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.","['Our_results', 'a_hypothesis', 'a_bat_origin', 'Sarbecovirus', 'Betacoronavirus']","['Our results', 'a hypothesis', 'a bat origin', 'Sarbecovirus', 'Betacoronavirus']",Our results,a hypothesis,a bat origin,Sarbecovirus,Betacoronavirus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Filovirus infection requires fusion of the host cell and virus membranes, a process that is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). GP contains two subunits, the surface subunit (GP1), which is responsible for cell attachment, and the transmembrane subunit (GP2), which catalyzes membrane fusion. The GP2 ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions, N-terminal and C-terminal (NHR and CHR, respectively) that adopt a six-helix bundle during the fusion process. The refolding of this six-helix bundle provides the thermodynamic driving force to overcome barriers associated with membrane fusion. Here we report the crystal structure of the MARV GP2 core domain in its post-fusion (six-helix bundle) conformation at 1.9 Å resolution. The MARV GP2 core domain backbone conformation is virtually identical to that of EBOV GP2 (reported previously), and consists of a central NHR core trimeric coiled-coil packed against peripheral CHR α-helices and an intervening loop/helix-turn-helix segment. We previously reported that the stability of the MARV GP2 post-fusion structure is highly pH-dependent, with increasing stability at lower pH [Harrison, J.S.; Koellhoffer, J. K.; Chandran, K.; and Lai, J. R. Biochemistry, 2012, 51, 2515–2525]. We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the post-fusion six helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately matured endosomes. In this report, a structural rationale for this pH-dependent stability is described, and involves a high-density array of core and surface acidic side chains at the midsection of the structure, termed the ‘anion stripe.’ In addition, many surface-exposed salt bridges likely contribute to stabilizing the post-fusion structure at low pH. These results provide structural insights into the mechanism of MARV GP2-mediated membrane fusion.",We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the post-fusion six helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately matured endosomes.,"['this_pH-dependent_stability', 'a_mechanism', 'conformational_control', 'such that the_post-fusion_six_helix_bundle', 'the_environments', 'appropriately_matured_endosomes']","['this pH-dependent stability', 'a mechanism', 'conformational control', 'such that the post-fusion six helix bundle', 'the environments', 'appropriately matured endosomes']",this pH-dependent stability,a mechanism,conformational control,such that the post-fusion six helix bundle,the environments,appropriately matured endosomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the most relevant cellular proteases in this process are those closely linked to host cell receptors.

ACE2 immunoprecipitation captured transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), a known human airway and alveolar protease. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 colocalized on cell surfaces and enhanced the cell entry of both SARS S-pseudotyped HIV and authentic SARS-CoV. Enhanced entry correlated with TMPRSS2-mediated proteolysis of both S and ACE2.

Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation has been established (S. Beushausenet al.(1987).J. Virol.61, 3795–3803). An inducer which accelerates maturation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) also upregulates the expression of the regulatory subunit, R1 of PK1. Since (i) early block preventing infection of mature oligodendrocytes can be bypassed when transfection with genomic RNA is used and (ii) inhibitors of PKs counteract the dbcAMP effect, so as to alleviate the inhibition of JHMV, enhanced expression of R1 appeared to be connected with virus restriction. This idea was confirmed following upregulation of the R1 gene in fully permissive L-2 cells. There was a connection between an effect due to R1 and dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein N by an endosomal phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase) having the properties of types 1 or 2A enzyme which occurs during penetration of inoculum virions. An inhibitionin vitro(cell free) of N dephosphorylation by R1 together with evidence thatin vivo(cell culture) overexpression of R1 inhibited the endosomal PPPase as well as replication of JHMV supports the hypothesis that uncoating of the JHMV inoculum occurs after dephosphorylation, a step obligatory for dissociation of the N protein from the genome. Thus inhibition by R prevents uncoating and thereby interferes with the commencement of replication. These observations intimate the existence of a novel mechanism controlling a virus infection of specific cell target(s) undergoing a process of differentiation and maturation in the central nervous system.","PPPase as well as replication of JHMV supports the hypothesis that uncoating of the JHMV inoculum occurs after dephosphorylation, a step obligatory for dissociation of the N protein from the genome.","['replication', 'JHMV', 'the_hypothesis', 'uncoating', 'the_JHMV_inoculum', 'dephosphorylation', 'a_step_obligatory', 'dissociation', 'the_N_protein', 'the_genome']","['replication', 'JHMV', 'the hypothesis', 'uncoating', 'the JHMV inoculum', 'dephosphorylation', 'a step obligatory', 'dissociation', 'the N protein', 'the genome']",replication,JHMV,the hypothesis,uncoating,the JHMV inoculum,dephosphorylation,a step obligatory,dissociation,the N protein,the genome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, identification of factors in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that are associated with cancer progression may represent novel therapeutic targets.

TLRs can bind exogenous molecules derived from pathogens as well as endogenous self-ligands released from damaged cells. Recent reports demonstrate that TLR engagement on primary mouse or human T cells enhances proliferation and/or cell survival. The mechanisms by which TLR stimulation on T cells influences these parameters and the different T-cell subsets that are affected by TLR stimulation are currently under investigation. Furthermore, neither the biological importance of stimulating TLRs on neoplastic T cells nor the prevalence of TLR expression in T-cell malignancies have yet to be characterized.

In CD4(+) T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cell-specific Oct1 loss on autoimmune- and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. RESULTS: Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4(+) T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our findings uncover a significant difference between the effect of Oct1 loss on autoimmune and anti-pathogen responses, which potentially could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (± 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. RESULTS: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (OR(M-H) = ∞; 95%CI = 3.7-∞); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (OR(M-H) = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27% (3/11) of cases vs. 14% (11/81) of controls used indomethacin prior to disease onset (OR(M-H) = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36). None of the blood samples were positive for any of the VHFs. CONCLUSION: This reported cluster of hematemesis illness was due to predisposing conditions and use of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID).

The disease can be very debilitating with vision loss, motor and sensory disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The clinical course may present as a relapsing‐remitting disease course, a progressive disease course, or a combination thereof. The etiology of MS is unknown. Though many viruses have been shown to be associated with MS, no one virus has ever been demonstrated to be the cause of MS. In addition, MS is thought to have an autoimmune component. Molecular mimicry is one hypothesis put forth which could reconcile the diverse pathology and etiology of MS. Molecular mimicry occurs when peptides from pathogens share sequence or structural similarities with self‐antigens. Infection with various pathogens, each with its individual molecular mimic to a CNS antigen, may explain the inability of investigators to link one specific virus to MS. Molecular mimicry may be mediated through human leukocyte antigen class I‐ and class II‐restricted T cells and antibodies, which may explain the diversity in phenotype. Aspects of molecular mimicry will be discussed in relation to each of these immune system components. Examples of various molecular mimics will be discussed with a particular focus on the CNS and MS. Molecular mimicry alone may not be able to induce disease; priming of the immune system by infection with a pathogen that carries a molecular mimic to self may have to be followed by a later nonspecific immunologic challenge in order for disease to be initiated.

The interaction between φ6 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT–φ6 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edge-attached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.","We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity.","['the_surface_charge_distribution', 'dictates', 'the_components', 'aggregation', 'viral_stability', 'infectivity']","['the surface charge distribution', 'dictates', 'the components', 'aggregation', 'viral stability', 'infectivity']",the surface charge distribution,dictates,the components,aggregation,viral stability,infectivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conservation of the N-terminal region in two apparently unrelated proteins of two different RNA virus families suggested that this helix might represent an independent module.

The chimeras manifested a wide range of growth and RNA synthesis phenotypes.

Coronaviruses induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), but the role of DMVs in replication and virus fitness remains unclear. Coronaviruses encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), three of which, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are necessary and sufficient for DMV formation. It has been shown previously that mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 loop 1 that alter nsp4 glycosylation are associated with disrupted DMV formation and result in changes in virus replication and RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether DMV morphology or another function of nsp4 glycosylation is responsible for effects on virus replication. In this study, we tested whether mutations across nsp4, both alone and in combination with mutations that abolish nsp4 glycosylation, affected DMV formation, replication, and fitness. Residues in nsp4 distinct from glycosylation sites, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal loop 1, independently disrupted both the number and morphology of DMVs and exacerbated DMV changes associated with loss of glycosylation. Mutations that altered DMV morphology but not glycosylation did not affect virus fitness while viruses lacking nsp4 glycosylation exhibited a loss in fitness. The results support the hypothesis that DMV morphology and numbers are not key determinants of virus fitness. The results also suggest that nsp4 glycosylation serves roles in replication in addition to the organization and stability of MHV-induced double-membrane vesicles. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense RNA viruses modify host cytoplasmic membranes for viral replication complex formation. Thus, defining the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane modifications is essential for both understanding virus replication and development of novel approaches to virus inhibition. Coronavirus-induced membrane changes include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes. Three viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are known to be required for DMV formation. It is unknown how these proteins induce membrane modification or which regions of the proteins are involved in DMV formation and stability. In this study, we show that mutations across nsp4 delay virus replication and disrupt DMV formation and that loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial fitness cost.

From a metabolic point of view, adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an essential protein in the regulation of the total intracellular and extracellular adenosine in a tissue. In addition to its cytosolic localization, ADA is also expressed as an ecto-enzyme on the surface of different cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26) and some ARs act as binding proteins for extracellular ADA in humans. Since CD26 and ARs interact with ADA at opposite sites, we have investigated if ADA can function as a cell-to-cell communication molecule by bridging the anchoring molecules CD26 and A(2A)R present on the surfaces of the interacting cells. By combining site-directed mutagenesis of ADA amino acids involved in binding to A(2A)R and a modification of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique that allows detection of interactions between two proteins expressed in different cell populations with low steric hindrance (NanoBRET), we show direct evidence of the specific formation of trimeric complexes CD26-ADA-A(2A)R involving two cells. By dynamic mass redistribution assays and ligand binding experiments, we also demonstrate that A(2A)R-NanoLuc fusion proteins are functional. The existence of this ternary complex is in good agreement with the hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells (expressing CD26) and dendritic cells (expressing A(2A)R).

Inherited variations in genes encoding these receptors and proteins and their signaling pathways may affect their function, possibly modulating cancer risk and features of cancer progression. There are numerous studies investigating the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms within or near genes encoding Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors, cancer risk, and features of cancer progression.

Nevertheless, there is some evidence supporting the hypothesis that inherited C-type lectin receptor and RIG-I-like receptor variants can be associated with increased cancer risk. Certain C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns of potentially oncogenic infectious agents, and certain polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors may have functional consequences at the molecular level that can lead to association of such single nucleotide polymorphisms with risk or progression of some diseases that may modulate cancer risk, so these gene polymorphisms may affect cancer risk indirectly.

It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. RESULTS: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a “weight” using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.

Thus, chloroquine has found applications in autoimmune diseases where it apparently facilitates apoptosis of abnormally persistent T-cell clones. The mode of action of chloroquine in prevention of malaria is not known, but it may be to minimize replication of the parasite in the liver cells, which occurs before invasion of the erythrocytes, by facilitating premature apoptosis of the infected host cells. After introduction of chloroquine in the 1950s world-wide for prophylactic use, chloroquine-resistant malaria emerged. Here it is hypothesized that concurrent with emergence of chloroquine-resistant malaria (presumably with enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities), other intracellular parasites have evolved to enhance their ability to prevent apoptosis in host cells. Two examples of viral diseases that have emerged from areas of high incidence of chloroquine-resistant malaria are AIDS from HIV and SARS from coronavirus. The hypothesis holds that prophylactic exposure to pro-apoptotic chloroquine drugs caused natural selection for strains of viruses and other parasites that have enhanced anti-apoptotic abilities. When transmitted to host organisms that are not under the influence of the pro-apoptotic drug, the new “anti-apoptotic” strains may cause unexpected diseases. In the case of SARS, the coronavirus appears to have accessed a new niche where it proves to be lethal to its host. In the case of AIDS, the HIV (which has had a long-term symbiotic relationship with primates) has run amuck because the infected cells are now substantially more tolerant to the toxins (i.e., resistant to apoptosis) that they secrete than the uninfected bystander cells, which are not unusually resistant to apoptosis. A corollary to the hypothesis is that if the level of resistance to apoptosis in the infected cells were no higher than the level of resistance in the bystander cells, then the infected cells would preferentially kill themselves through apoptosis. It appears that in the case of HIV, the increased resistance to apoptosis is provided by expression of Bcl-2 and suppression of p53. Hence, drugs that suppresses Bcl-2 or restore p53 function might be effective in restoring the parity of resistance to apoptosis between infected and uninfected cells. Currently, an antisense drug targeting Bcl-2 (G3139/GenasenseTM, Genta, Inc.) is in late-stage cancer trials and may be on the market for those indications in months. It would be interesting to try these drugs against various intracellular parasites including HIV. This approach to prevent or eliminate active infections might be particularly attractive against a range of parasites (virus, bacteria, protozoa, fungus) when safe and effective vaccines are not available.","Here it is hypothesized that concurrent with emergence of chloroquine-resistant malaria (presumably with enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities), other intracellular parasites have evolved to enhance their ability to prevent apoptosis in host cells.","['emergence', 'chloroquine-resistant_malaria', 'enhanced_anti-apoptotic_capabilities', 'other_intracellular_parasites', 'their_ability', 'apoptosis', 'host_cells']","['emergence', 'chloroquine-resistant malaria', 'enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities', 'other intracellular parasites', 'their ability', 'apoptosis', 'host cells']",emergence,chloroquine-resistant malaria,enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities,other intracellular parasites,their ability,apoptosis,host cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury during URI, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs), is related to AOM complication. METHODS: LDH concentrations were determined in NPS samples (n = 594) that were collected at the initial visit for URI from 183 children who were followed for the development of AOM. A subset of NPS samples (n = 134) was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α concentrations. RESULTS: AOM complication was independently predicted by LDH concentrations (median mU/ml with AOM = 2,438 vs. without AOM = 1,573stimate = 0.276; P = 0.02). LDH effect on AOM development was highest during the first 4 d of URI. LDH concentrations were higher in URIs due to adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and rhinoviruses as compared with virus-negative samples (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between concentrations of LDH and all cytokines (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: LDH concentrations in NPS are positively associated with AOM risk, suggesting that the severity of nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during URI contributes to the development of AOM and that reduction of inflammatory injury may reduce the risk for AOM.","We hypothesized that the severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury during URI, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs), is related to AOM complication.","['nasopharyngeal_cellular_injury', 'URI', 'lactate_dehydrogenase_(LDH)_concentrations', 'nasopharyngeal_secretions', 'NPSs', 'AOM_complication']","['nasopharyngeal cellular injury', 'URI', 'lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations', 'nasopharyngeal secretions', 'NPSs', 'AOM complication']",nasopharyngeal cellular injury,URI,lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations,nasopharyngeal secretions,NPSs,AOM complication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3.

To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.","Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.","['our_findings', 'that tolerance', 'viral_infection', 'enhanced_potency', 'antiviral_defenses', 'by which bats', 'host', 'viruses', 'humans']","['our findings', 'that tolerance', 'viral infection', 'enhanced potency', 'antiviral defenses', 'by which bats', 'host', 'viruses', 'humans']",our findings,that tolerance,viral infection,enhanced potency,antiviral defenses,by which bats,host,viruses,humans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a genome resequencing approach to resolve the evolutionary history of an important microbial pathogen, the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has been implicated in amphibian declines worldwide. We sequenced the genomes of 29 isolates of Bd from around the world, with an emphasis on North, Central, and South America because of the devastating effect that Bd has had on amphibian populations in the New World. We found a substantial amount of evolutionary complexity in Bd with deep phylogenetic diversity that predates observed global amphibian declines. By investigating the entire genome, we found that even the most recently evolved Bd clade (termed the global panzootic lineage) contained more genetic variation than previously reported. We also found dramatic differences among isolates and among genomic regions in chromosomal copy number and patterns of heterozygosity, suggesting complex and heterogeneous genome dynamics. Finally, we report evidence for selection acting on the Bd genome, supporting the hypothesis that protease genes are important in evolutionary transitions in this group. Bd is considered an emerging pathogen because of its recent effects on amphibians, but our data indicate that it has a complex evolutionary history that predates recent disease outbreaks.

But these therapies are very often of limited efficacy or have severe side effects. Therefore there is great interest in developing new efficacious and safe antiviral compounds e.g. based on the identification of compounds of herbal origin. Hypothesis Since an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill. shows antiviral activity against viruses causing infections of the upper respiratory tract in vitro we hypothesised that a product containing it such as Biaron C® could have an antiviral activity too. Study design Antiviral activity of Bioaron C®, an herbal medicinal product consisting of an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill., Vitamin C, and Aronia melanocarpa Elliot. succus, added as an excipient, was tested in vitro against a broad panel of viruses involved in upper respiratory tract infections. Methods These studies included human adenovirus and several RNA viruses and were performed either with plaque reduction assays or with tests for the detection of a virus-caused cytopathic effect. Results Our studies demonstrated an impressive activity of Bioaron C® against members of the orthomyxoviridae – influenza A and influenza B viruses. Replication of both analysed influenza A virus strains – H1N1 and H3N2 – as well as replication of two analysed influenza B viruses – strains Yamagatal and Beiying – was significantly reduced after addition of Bioaron C® to the infected cell cultures. In contrast antiviral activity of Bioaron C® against other RNA viruses showed a heterogeneous pattern. Bioaron C® inhibited the replication of human rhinovirus and coxsackievirus, both viruses belonging to the family of picornaviridae and both representing non-enveloped RNA viruses. In vitro infections with respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus, both belonging to the paramyxoviridae, were only poorly blocked by the test substance. No antiviral activity of Bioaron C® was detected against adenovirus – a non-enveloped DNA virus.

Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, α-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-γ. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-γ, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with α-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with α-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size.

Therefore, discovering additional therapeutic options would be a valuable aid to public health. Recently, TLR4 inhibition has emerged as a possible mechanism for protection against influenza-associated lethality and acute lung injury. Based on recent data showing that rhesus macaque θ-defensins could inhibit TLR4-dependent gene expression, we tested the hypothesis that a novel θ-defensin, retrocyclin (RC)-101, could disrupt TLR4-dependent signaling and protect against viral infection. In this study, RC-101, a variant of the humanized θ-defensin RC-1, blocked TLR4-mediated gene expression in mouse and human macrophages in response to LPS, targeting both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. In a cell-free assay, RC-101 neutralized the biologic activity of LPS at doses ranging from 0.5 to 50 EU/ml, consistent with data showing that RC-101 binds biotinylated LPS. The action of RC-101 was not limited to the TLR4 pathway because RC-101 treatment of macrophages also inhibited gene expression in response to a TLR2 agonist, Pam3CSK4, but failed to bind that biotinylated agonist. Mouse macrophages infected in vitro with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 influenza A virus (PR8) also produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene products in a TLR4-independent fashion when treated with RC-101. Finally, RC-101 decreased both the lethality and clinical severity associated with PR8 infection in mice. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that RC-101 exhibits therapeutic potential for the mitigation of influenza-related morbidity and mortality, potentially acting through TLR-dependent and TLR-independent mechanisms.","Based on recent data showing that rhesus macaque θ-defensins could inhibit TLR4-dependent gene expression, we tested the hypothesis that a novel θ-defensin, retrocyclin (RC)-101, could disrupt TLR4-dependent signaling and protect against viral infection.","['recent_data', 'TLR4-dependent_gene_expression', 'the_hypothesis', 'a_novel_θ-defensin', 'retrocyclin', 'RC)-101', 'TLR4-dependent', 'viral_infection']","['recent data', 'TLR4-dependent gene expression', 'the hypothesis', 'a novel θ-defensin', 'retrocyclin', 'RC)-101', 'TLR4-dependent', 'viral infection']",recent data,TLR4-dependent gene expression,the hypothesis,a novel θ-defensin,retrocyclin,RC)-101,TLR4-dependent,viral infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs. Meanwhile, oxidation pathway of two catechin molecules to form TFs were hypothesized. Also, ascertainment of the several therapeutic efficiency of the family members of TFs would be the next step in the future.","Meanwhile, oxidation pathway of two catechin molecules to form TFs were hypothesized.","['oxidation_pathway', 'two_catechin_molecules', 'TFs']","['oxidation pathway', 'two catechin molecules', 'TFs']",oxidation pathway,two catechin molecules,TFs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structural information on this crucial protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which is lethally pathogenic and has caused severe respiratory diseases worldwide, is lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 at a 2.7-Å resolution and performed the relevant biochemical assays to study how NendoU activity is regulated. Although the overall structure is conserved, MERS-CoV Nsp15 shows unique and novel features compared to its homologs. Serine substitution of residue F285, which harbors an aromatic side chain that disturbs RNA binding compared with that of other homologs, increases catalytic activity. Mutations of residues residing on the oligomerization interfaces that distort hexamerization, namely, N38A, Y58A, and N157A, decrease thermostability, decrease affinity of binding with RNA, and reduce the NendoU activity of Nsp15. In contrast, mutant D39A exhibits increased activity and a higher substrate binding capacity. Importantly, Nsp8 was found to interact with both monomeric and hexameric Nsp15. The Nsp7/Nsp8 complex displays a higher binding affinity for Nsp15. Furthermore, Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex also enhance the NendoU activity of hexameric Nsp15 in vitro. Taking the findings together, this work first provides evidence on how the activity of Nsp15 may be functionally mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, RNA binding efficiency, or the possible association with other nonstructural proteins.

Endoribonuclease Nsp15 encoded by coronavirus plays an important role in viral infection and pathogenesis. This study determines the structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 and demonstrates how the catalytic activity of this protein is potentially mediated, thereby providing structural and functional evidence for developing antiviral drugs. We also hypothesize that the primase-like protein Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex may interact with Nsp15 and affect enzymatic activity.

Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms.

We focus on the host–pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health.

Most existing studies of herpes viruses have used small populations and postdiagnosis specimens. As part of a larger research program, we conducted a hypothesis-generating case-control study of selected herpes virus antibodies among individuals discharged from the US military with schizophrenia and pre- and postdiagnosis sera. Methods: Cases (n = 180) were servicemembers hospitalized and discharged from military service with schizophrenia. Controls, 3:1 matched on several factors, were members not discharged. The military routinely collects and stores members' serum specimens. We used microplate enzyme immunoassay to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels to 6 herpes viruses in pre- and postdiagnosis specimens. Conditional logistic regression was used, and the measure of association was the hazard ratio (HR). Results: Overall, we found a significant association between human herpes virus type 6 and schizophrenia, with an HR of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04, 1.32).

(2) which immunological effector arm most likely protects against rotavirus disease? (3) by what means is virus antigen best presented to the host to elicit a protective immune response? (4) what are the advantages and disadvantages of replicating agents as compared to nonreplicating agents as candidate rotavirus vaccines? Although two proteins (vp4 and vp7) are probably important in inducing protection against challenge, it has not been clearly demonstrated that inclusion of the epidemiologically important human P or G type is important in protection against human disease. No immunological effector arm clearly explains protection against heterotypic challenge. Protection against disease is not predicted by rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies in serum. Oral inoculation may not be necessary to induce a protective, virus-specific immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface, but parenteral inoculation of experimental animals with rotavirus induces an immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface that is protective against challenge. Induction of a rotavirus-specific protective immune response is probably associated with the presence of virus-specific T and B cells in intestinal lymphoid tissues and virus-specific sIgA or IgG at the intestinal mucosal surface.

As RIG-I is absent in chickens, MDA5 is hypothesized to be important in detecting viral nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) expression has yet to be fully elucidated. With this in mind, a ∼2.5kb chMDA5 gene promoter region was examined and PCR amplified to assess its role in immune response. A chMDA5 promoter reporter plasmid (piggybac-MDA5-DsRed) was constructed and transfected into DF-1 cells to establish a Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line. The MDA5 promoter activity was extremely low under basal condition, but was dramatically increased when cells were stimulated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), interferon beta (IFN-β) or Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV). The DsRed mRNA level represented the promoter activity and was remarkably increased, which matched the expression of endogenous MDA5. However, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to increase the MDA5 promoter activity and the expression of endogenous MDA5. The results indicated that the promoter and the Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line could be utilized to determine whether a ligand regulates MDA5 expression.

Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT(2) receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the renin-angiotensin system, and the AT(2) receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet.

It is therefore important to estimate the evolutionary rates of dsDNA viruses independent of the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Here, we explore the use of temporally structured sequence data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the evolutionary rates for seven human dsDNA viruses, including variola virus (VARV) (the causative agent of smallpox) and herpes simplex virus-1. Our analyses reveal that although the VARV genome is likely to evolve at a rate of approximately 1 × 10(−5) substitutions/site/year and hence approaching that of many RNA viruses, the evolutionary rates of many other dsDNA viruses remain problematic to estimate. Synthetic data sets were constructed to inform our interpretation of the substitution rates estimated for these dsDNA viruses and the analysis of these demonstrated that given a sequence data set of appropriate length and sampling depth, it is possible to use time-structured analyses to estimate the substitution rates of many dsDNA viruses independently from the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Finally, the discovery that some dsDNA viruses may evolve at rates approaching those of RNA viruses has important implications for our understanding of the long-term evolutionary history and emergence potential of this major group of viruses.","However, the hypothesis of codivergence between dsDNA viruses and their hosts has rarely been rigorously tested, even though the vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates for dsDNA viruses are based upon this assumption.","['the_hypothesis', 'codivergence', 'dsDNA_viruses', 'their_hosts', 'the_vast_majority', 'nucleotide_substitution_rate_estimates', 'dsDNA_viruses', 'this_assumption']","['the hypothesis', 'codivergence', 'dsDNA viruses', 'their hosts', 'the vast majority', 'nucleotide substitution rate estimates', 'dsDNA viruses', 'this assumption']",the hypothesis,codivergence,dsDNA viruses,their hosts,the vast majority,nucleotide substitution rate estimates,dsDNA viruses,this assumption,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With inbreeding nearly complete, we estimated the extinction rate among CC lines at a remarkable 95%, which is substantially higher than in the derivation of other mouse recombinant inbred populations. Here, we report genome-wide allele frequencies in 347 extinct CC lines. Contrary to expectations, autosomes had equal allelic contributions from the eight founders, but chromosome X had significantly lower allelic contributions from the two inbred founders with underrepresented subspecific origins (PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ). By comparing extinct CC lines to living CC strains, we conclude that a complex genetic architecture is driving extinction, and selection pressures are different on the autosomes and chromosome X. Male infertility played a large role in extinction as 47% of extinct lines had males that were infertile. Males from extinct lines had high variability in reproductive organ size, low sperm counts, low sperm motility, and a high rate of vacuolization of seminiferous tubules. We performed QTL mapping and identified nine genomic regions associated with male fertility and reproductive phenotypes. Many of the allelic effects in the QTL were driven by the two founders with underrepresented subspecific origins, including a QTL on chromosome X for infertility that was driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype. We also performed the first example of cross validation using complementary CC resources to verify the effect of sperm curvilinear velocity from the PWK/PhJ haplotype on chromosome 2 in an independent population across multiple generations. While selection typically constrains the examination of reproductive traits toward the more fertile alleles, the CC extinct lines provided a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of fertility in a widely genetically variable population. We hypothesize that incompatibilities between alleles with different subspecific origins is a key driver of infertility.

An easy and time-saving method is the preparation of ORS in milk. As milk-based ORS are hypertonic solutions administration of them may trigger thirst. Therefore, we hypothesized that restrictively fed calves receiving ORS prepared in milk had a higher water intake than restrictively and ad libitum fed calves receiving ORS prepared in water during diarrheic episodes. The daily water intake was measured in 100 individually-housed Holstein Friesian calves from day 2 to 21 of life. One group of the calves was fed with restrictive amounts of milk, the other group got milk ad libitum by an automated milk feeder. Nearly all calves spontaneously developed diarrhea within the observation period from day 2 to 21 of life. In cases of diarrhea the restrictively-fed calves received ORS prepared in milk or ORS prepared in water two hours after their milk meal, whereas the ad libitum-fed calves only got ORS prepared in water. All calves had ad libitum access to water. The daily intake of water, milk, and ORS and weight gain during diarrheic episode were determined. Data were expressed as arithmetic means (±standard deviation) and analyzed by using a one-way ANOVA or repeated-measures ANOVA. From day 2 to 21 of life calves fed with restrictive amounts of milk had higher water intakes related to the total dry matter intake (DMI) with 1.6L/kg of total DMI than ad libitum-fed calves (0.9L/kg of total DMI) per day. In cases of diarrhea water intake increased in all feeding groups. The calves receiving milk-based ORS had the highest water intake with 1.7L/d during the period of diarrhea compared to the calves received ORS prepared in water. Moreover, the calves fed ORS in milk showed with 4.6L/d the highest daily ORS intake. There were no differences in the duration of diarrhea or the daily weight gain during period of diarrhea between the feeding regimens. Therefore, it can be concluded that all feeding regimens were suitable in the treatment of calf diarrhea. The simplest method to treat calves suffering from diarrhea is the preparation of ORS in milk, but then ad libitum availability of water is absolutely necessary. Moreover, calves drink considerable amounts of water within the first 3 weeks of life and therefore should be provided with water for animal welfare reasons.","Therefore, we hypothesized that restrictively fed calves receiving ORS prepared in milk had a higher water intake than restrictively and ad libitum fed calves receiving ORS prepared in water during diarrheic episodes.","['calves', 'ORS', 'milk', 'a_higher_water_intake', 'than restrictively and ad_libitum fed calves', 'ORS', 'water', 'diarrheic_episodes']","['calves', 'ORS', 'milk', 'a higher water intake', 'than restrictively and ad libitum fed calves', 'ORS', 'water', 'diarrheic episodes']",calves,ORS,milk,a higher water intake,than restrictively and ad libitum fed calves,ORS,water,diarrheic episodes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It focuses on the mouse and descriptive morphology is used for considering both molecular mechanisms, underpinning kidney morphogenesis and differentiation, and the ways in which these processes can go awry and lead to congenital kidney disorders—particularly in humans. The mature kidney is a fairly complex organ attached to an arterial input vessel and two output vessels, the vein and the ureter. Inside, the artery and vein are connected by a complex network of capillaries that invade a large number of glomeruli, the proximal entrance to nephrons, which are filtration units that link to an arborized collecting-duct system that drains into the ureter. The ability of the kidney and isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme, to develop in culture means that the developing tissues can be subjected to a wide variety of experimental procedures designed to investigate their molecular and cellular properties and to test hypotheses about developmental mechanisms.","The ability of the kidney and isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme, to develop in culture means that the developing tissues can be subjected to a wide variety of experimental procedures designed to investigate their molecular and cellular properties and to test hypotheses about developmental mechanisms.","['The_ability', 'the_kidney', 'isolated_metanephrogenic_mesenchyme', 'culture', 'the_developing_tissues', 'experimental_procedures', 'their_molecular_and_cellular_properties', 'hypotheses', 'developmental_mechanisms']","['The ability', 'the kidney', 'isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme', 'culture', 'the developing tissues', 'experimental procedures', 'their molecular and cellular properties', 'hypotheses', 'developmental mechanisms']",The ability,the kidney,isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme,culture,the developing tissues,experimental procedures,their molecular and cellular properties,hypotheses,developmental mechanisms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different–omic types (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules, incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","['The_resulting_networks', 'new_host_response_patterns', 'interactions', 'viral_infection', 'generate', 'new_hypotheses', 'pathogenic_mechanisms', 'mechanisms', 'disease']","['The resulting networks', 'new host response patterns', 'interactions', 'viral infection', 'generate', 'new hypotheses', 'pathogenic mechanisms', 'mechanisms', 'disease']",The resulting networks,new host response patterns,interactions,viral infection,generate,new hypotheses,pathogenic mechanisms,mechanisms,disease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non–consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non–consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average).

This study uses Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare differential spinal cord mRNA levels between mice infected with demyelinating and non-demyelinating strains of MHV to identify host immune genes expressed in this demyelinating disease model. The study reveals that during the acute stage of infection, both strains induce inflammatory innate immune response genes, whereas upregulation of several immunoglobulin genes during chronic stage infection is unique to infection with the demyelinating strain. Results suggest that the demyelinating strain induced an innate-immune response during acute infection that may promote switching of Ig isotype genes during chronic infection, potentially playing a role in antibody-mediated progressive demyelination even after viral clearance.","The presence of immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients supports the hypothesis of an infectious etiology, although the antigenic targets remain elusive.","['The_presence', 'immunoglobulin_oligoclonal_bands', 'the_cerebrospinal_fluid', 'Multiple_Sclerosis_(MS)_patients', 'the_hypothesis', 'an_infectious_etiology', 'the_antigenic_targets']","['The presence', 'immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands', 'the cerebrospinal fluid', 'Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients', 'the hypothesis', 'an infectious etiology', 'the antigenic targets']",The presence,immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands,the cerebrospinal fluid,Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients,the hypothesis,an infectious etiology,the antigenic targets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks. SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 1607 hospital HCWs aged ≥18 years working full-time in selected high-risk wards. INTERVENTION: Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection. RESULTS: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.

We have recently shown that soluble forms of the chicken and quail Tva receptor (sTva), expressed from genes delivered by retroviral vectors, block ALV(A) infection of cultured chicken cells (∼200-fold antiviral effect) and chickens (>98% of the birds were not infected). We hypothesized that inhibition of viral replication by sTva would select virus variants with mutations in the surface glycoprotein (SU) that altered the binding affinity of the subgroup A SU for the sTva protein and/or altered the normal receptor usage of the virus. Virus propagation in the presence of quail sTva-mIgG, the quail Tva extracellular region fused to the constant region of the mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) protein, identified viruses with three mutations in the subgroup A hr1 region of SU, E149K, Y142N, and Y142N/E149K. These mutations reduced the binding affinity of the subgroup A envelope glycoproteins for quail sTva-mIgG (32-, 324-, and 4,739-fold, respectively) but did not alter their binding affinity for chicken sTva-mIgG. The ALV(A) mutants efficiently infected cells expressing the chicken Tva receptor but were 2-fold (E149K), 10-fold (Y142N), and 600-fold (Y142N/E149K) less efficient at infecting cells expressing the quail Tva receptor.

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors—which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines—induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.",IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it.,"['IMPORTANCE', 'vigorous_replication', 'a_pathogen', 'the_most_potent_and_balanced_immune_response']","['IMPORTANCE', 'vigorous replication', 'a pathogen', 'the most potent and balanced immune response']",IMPORTANCE,vigorous replication,a pathogen,the most potent and balanced immune response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nanoparticles are able to display coupled antigenic arrays at high density and provide multiple binding molecular scenarios with BCRs. The high-resolution antigenic structure makes it possible to accurately display stable neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, the development of a nanovaccine that orientationally displays neutralizing epitopes is a feasible strategy.

However, it is still unclear whether this change in disease expression increases the global mortality it induces because the disease becomes more severe and also less frequent. Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel. Firstly, we show that there is a change in the severity of the disease during the fragmentation process, especially at a local scale, suggesting that host population fragmentation could be a widespread mechanism of disease emergence.

We demonstrated that anti-S1 IgG neutralizes the virus and binds to the membrane associated S protein more efficiently than anti-S2 IgG does. Moreover, both anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-S1 IgG showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency. The unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG towards the receptor binding implied a possible role of the S2 subunit in virus docking process and argues against the current hypothesis of viral entry. On the other hand, the functional roles of the previously reported neutralizing epitopes within S2 subunit were investigated using an antigen specific antibody depletion assay. Depletion of antibodies against these regions significantly diminished, though not completely abolished, the neutralizing effects of anti-S2 IgG. It suggests the absence of a major neutralizing domain on S2 protein. The possible ways of anti-S2 IgGs to abolish the receptor binding and the factors restricting anti-S2 IgGs to neutralize the virus are discussed.",The unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG towards the receptor binding implied a possible role of the S2 subunit in virus docking process and argues against the current hypothesis of viral entry.,"['anti-S2_IgG', 'receptor', 'a_possible_role', 'the_S2_subunit', 'virus_docking_process', 'the_current_hypothesis', 'viral_entry']","['anti-S2 IgG', 'receptor', 'a possible role', 'the S2 subunit', 'virus docking process', 'the current hypothesis', 'viral entry']",anti-S2 IgG,receptor,a possible role,the S2 subunit,virus docking process,the current hypothesis,viral entry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens.

Previously, we showed that, in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, rhinovirus (RV) infection increases type 2 cytokine production from alternatively-activated (M2) airway macrophages, enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. METHODS: Eight week-old wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. RESULTS: In contrast to OVA-treated wild-type mice with both neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation, OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed increased neutrophilic inflammation with few eosinophils in the airways. Like wild-type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV. There was a shift in lung cytokines from a type 2-predominant response to a type 1 response, including production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α. IL-17A was also increased. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice further increased neutrophilic inflammation. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed an M1 polarization pattern and ex vivo RV infection increased macrophage production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12p40. Finally, lung cells from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed reduced CD206+ CD301+ M2 macrophages, decreased IL-13 and increased TNF-α and IL-17A production by F4/80+, CD11b+ macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection of OVA-treated mice increased type 1 cytokine and IL-17A production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. In mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4R signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection.","In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4","['this_paper', 'the_hypothesis', 'IL-4']","['this paper', 'the hypothesis', 'IL-4']",this paper,the hypothesis,IL-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity. We selected the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for analysis because of its well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification during the late stage of autophagic flux. We documented that bafilomycin treatment from 48 to 72 h postinfection lowered VZV titers substantially (P ≤ 0.008). Because we were unable to define the site of the block in the infectious cycle by confocal microscopy, we turned to electron microscopy. Capsids were observed in the nucleus, in the perinuclear space, and in the cytoplasm adjacent to Golgi apparatus vesicles. Many of the capsids had an aberrant appearance, as has been observed previously in infections not treated with bafilomycin. In contrast to prior untreated infections, however, secondary envelopment of capsids was not seen in the trans-Golgi network, nor were prototypical enveloped particles with capsids (virions) seen in cytoplasmic vesicles after bafilomycin treatment. Instead, multiple particles with varying diameters without capsids (light particles) were seen in large virus assembly compartments near the disorganized Golgi apparatus. Bafilomycin treatment also led to increased numbers of multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm, some of which contained remnants of the Golgi apparatus. In summary, we have defined a previously unrecognized property of bafilomycin whereby it disrupted the site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids by altering the pH of the trans-Golgi network and thereby preventing the correct formation of virus assembly compartments. IMPORTANCE This study of VZV assembly in the presence of bafilomycin A1 emphasizes the importance of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network as a platform in the alphaherpesvirus life cycle. We have previously shown that VZV induces levels of autophagy far above the basal levels of autophagy in human skin, a major site of VZV assembly. The current study documented that bafilomycin treatment led to impaired assembly of VZV capsids after primary envelopment/de-envelopment but before secondary reenvelopment. This VZV study also complemented prior herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus studies investigating two other inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus function: brefeldin A and monensin. Studies with porcine herpesvirus demonstrated that primary enveloped particles accumulated in the perinuclear space in the presence of brefeldin A, while studies with herpes simplex virus 1 documented an impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles in the presence of monensin.",The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity.,"['The_underlying_hypothesis', 'this_project', 'inhibitors', 'reduce', 'VZV_infectivity']","['The underlying hypothesis', 'this project', 'inhibitors', 'reduce', 'VZV infectivity']",The underlying hypothesis,this project,inhibitors,reduce,VZV infectivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All specimens were analyzed for Haemophilus influenzae(HI), Moraxella catarrhalis(MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae(SP) by quantitative-PCR. General linear models tested for relationships between respiratory pathogens, biomarkers (nasal wash neutrophils and CXCL8), and ARI-severity. Results Nasal specimens from adults with ARIs were more likely to contain bacteria (37% overall; HI = 28%, MC = 14%, SP = 7%) compared to specimens from healthy adults (5% overall; HI = 0%, MC = 2.5%, SP = 2.5%; p < 0.001). Among ARI specimens, bacteria were more likely to be detected among virus-negative specimens compared to virus-positive specimens (46% vs. 27%; p = 0.0046). The presence of bacteria was significantly associated with increased CXCL8 and neutrophils, but not increased symptoms.

We hypothesized that genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with a response to asthma therapy during an asthma exacerbation were also associated with severity of acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 5 common polymorphisms in the promoter region and coding block of the ADRB2 gene (loci -2387, -2274, -1343, +46, and +79) from 374 Caucasian and African American term infants who were enrolled at the time of acute respiratory illness over four respiratory viral seasons. Severity of respiratory tract infections was measured using a bronchiolitis severity score (BSS; range = 0-12, clinically significant difference = 0.5) with a higher score indicating more severe disease. We assigned the promoter, coding and combined promoter and coding haplotypes to the unphased genotype data. The associations between each of these five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as the haplotypes and infant BSS were analyzed using nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable proportional odds model separately in Caucasians and African Americans. RESULTS: There was no significant association between infant BSS and each of the SNPs in both Caucasians and African Americans. However, promoter haplotype CCA was associated with a decreased BSS in African Americans in a dose dependent manner. The median (interquartile range) BSS of infants with no copies of the CCA haplotype, one copy, and two copies of the CCA haplotype were 5.5 (2.0, 8.0), 4.0 (1.0, 7.5), and 3.0 (1.0, 4.0), respectively. This dose dependent relationship persisted after adjusting for infant age, gender, daycare exposure, secondhand smoke exposure, prior history of breastfeeding, siblings at home, and enrollment season (adjusted odds ratio: 0.59, 95 % confidence interval: 0.36, 0.98). There was no similar protective relationship of haplotype CCA on severity of respiratory tract infections identified in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: ADRB2 genotype may be predictive of severity of acute respiratory tract infections in African Americans, and potentially identify a subset of infants who may respond to beta-agonist therapy.

The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that the Type A trichothecene T-2 toxin interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to enteric reovirus infection. Mice were exposed i.p. first to 1.75 mg/kg bw T-2 and then 2 h later with 3 × 107 plaque-forming units of reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L). As compared to vehicle-treated control, T-2-treated mice had dramatically elevated intestinal plaque-forming viral titers after 5 days and failed to completely clear the virus from intestine by 10 days. Levels of reovirus λ2 core spike (L2 gene) RNA in feces in T-2-treated mice were significantly higher at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days than controls. T-2 potentiated L2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with as little as 50 μg/kg of the toxin having a potentiative effect. T-2 exposure transiently suppressed induction of reovirus-specific IgA in feces (6 and 8 days) as well as specific IgA and IgG2a in serum (5 days). This suppression corresponded to decreased secretion of reovirus-specific IgA and IgG2a in Peyer's patch (PP) and lamina propria fragment cultures prepared 5 days after infection. T-2 suppressed IFN-γ responses in PP to reovirus at 3 and 7 days as compared to infected controls whereas IL-2 mRNA concentrations were unaffected. PP IL-6 mRNA levels were increased 2-fold 2 h after T-2 treatment, but no differences between infected T-2-exposed and infected vehicle-treated mice were detectable over the next 7 days.

In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation.

To promote elderly people’s behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention, the aim of the current project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based low-administration-cost intervention building on a leading psychological theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). METHODS: The target group is Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or older who rarely or never adopt any preventive actions. This project will be conducted in three phases over 24 months. In phase 1, intervention program will be developed building on the HAPA theoretical framework which comprises both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors. In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation + behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable. Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model. DISCUSSION: The proposed project is expected to design theory-based intervention materials to promote the influenza prevention behaviors in Hong Kong elderly people and provide information on its effectiveness and the potential changing mechanism of behavior initiation and maintenance.

In contrast, very little is known about the viral proteins. In the present report we have identified the membrane glycoprotein (M) of PEDV by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the cloned M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated, and migrates with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the M protein synthesized by recombinant baculoviruses migrates with a Mr of 23 k, that is, with identical mobility as the deglycosylated product of PEDV. Thus, it appears that M protein specified by the recombinant baculovirus is poorly, if at all, glycosylated. Using monoclonal antibodies and rabbit antipeptide sera specific for the N and C termini of the M protein, we were able to show that a 19 k band detected in PEDV-infected cells but not in virions represented a fragment of M from which the C terminus had been cleaved off. Finally, by electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, the relative orientation of M within the virion envelope was determined as NexoCcyt.

The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures. We discuss the role of modelling in public health and we analyse the distinction between forecasting and projection models as assessing tools for the estimation of the impact of intervention strategies. The model is applied to the communities of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) and it mimics those epidemics with fairly good accuracy. The estimated values for the basic reproduction number, R 0, were 1.2 for Hong Kong and 1.32 for Toronto (Canada). The model projects that, in the absence of control, the final number of cases would be 320,000 in Hong Kong and 36,900 in Toronto (Canada). In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). Although SARS can be a devastating infection, early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate precaution measures, can be very effective to limit its spread.","The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures.","['The_model', 'a_testable_hypothesis', 'a_dynamical_equation', 'the_contact_parameter', 'time', 'control_measures']","['The model', 'a testable hypothesis', 'a dynamical equation', 'the contact parameter', 'time', 'control measures']",The model,a testable hypothesis,a dynamical equation,the contact parameter,time,control measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linear dextran applied as a blood plasma substitute demonstrates a high rate of biocompatibility. Dextran is present in foods, drugs, and vaccines and in most cases is applied as a biologically inert substance. In this review we analyze dextran’s cellular uptake principles, receptor specificity and, therefore, its ability to interfere with pathogen–lectin interactions: a promising basis for new antimicrobial strategies. Dextran-binding receptors in humans include the DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin) family receptors: DC-SIGN (CD209) and L-SIGN (the liver and lymphatic endothelium homologue of DC-SIGN), the mannose receptor (CD206), and langerin. These receptors take part in the uptake of pathogens by dendritic cells and macrophages and may also participate in the modulation of immune responses, mostly shown to be beneficial for pathogens per se rather than host(s). It is logical to predict that owing to receptor-specific interactions, dextran or its derivatives can interfere with these immune responses and improve infection outcome. Recent data support this hypothesis. We consider dextran a promising molecule for the development of lectin–glycan interaction-blocking molecules (such as DC-SIGN inhibitors) that could be applied in the treatment of diseases including tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS, etc. Dextran derivatives indeed change the pathology of infections dependent on DC-SIGN and mannose receptors. Complete knowledge of specific dextran–lectin interactions may also be important for development of future dextran applications in biological research and medicine.",Recent data support this hypothesis.,[],[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Old ChRM showed a higher risk of accelerated AIDS development than did young macaques, owing to rapidly elevated plasma viral loads and decreased levels of CD4(+) T cells. The low frequency of naïve CD4(+) T cells before infection was strongly predictive of an increased disease progression, whereas the severe depletion of CD4(+) T cells and the rapid proliferation of naïve lymphocytes accelerated the exhaustion of naïve lymphocytes in old ChRM. Moreover, in old ChRM, a robust innate host response with defective regulation was associated with a compensation for naïve T cell depletion and a high level of immune activation. Therefore, we suggest that immunosenescence plays an important role in the accelerated AIDS progression in elderly individuals and that SIV-infected old ChRM may be a favorable model for studying AIDS pathogenesis and researching therapies for elderly AIDS patients.","However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested.",[],[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. METHODS: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)) or normoxic (21% O(2)/5% CO(2)) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P < 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-α−converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/TACE.

ABs are produced during a viable but non-infectious developmental state termed “persistence” or “chlamydial stress.” As persistent/stressed chlamydiae: (i) may contribute to chronic inflammation observed in diseases like trachoma; and (ii) are more resistant to current anti-chlamydial drugs of choice, it is critical to better understand this developmental stage. We previously demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) co-infection induced Chlamydia pecorum persistence/stress in culture. One critical characteristic of persistence/stress is that the chlamydiae remain viable and can reenter the normal developmental cycle when the stressor is removed. Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited. Therefore, we performed time course experiments in which Vero cells were C. pecorum/PEDV infected in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits viral but not chlamydial protein synthesis. CHX-exposure inhibited PEDV replication, but did not inhibit induction of C. pecorum persistence at 24 h post-PEDV infection, as indicated by AB formation and reduced production of infectious EBs. Interestingly, production of infectious EBs resumed when CHX-exposed, co-infected cells were incubated 48–72 h post-PEDV co-infection. These data demonstrate that PEDV co-infection-induced chlamydial persistence/stress is reversible and suggest that this induction (i) does not require viral replication in host cells; and (ii) does not require de novo host or viral protein synthesis. These data also suggest that viral binding and/or entry may be required for this effect. Because the PEDV host cell receptor (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) stimulates cellular signaling pathways in the absence of PEDV infection, we suspect that PEDV co-infection might alter CD13 function and induce the chlamydiae to enter the persistent state.","Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited.","['PEDV-induced_persistence', 'viral_replication']","['PEDV-induced persistence', 'viral replication']",PEDV-induced persistence,viral replication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.","The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium.","['The_co-evolutionary_history', 'bats', 'viruses', 'the_bat-virus_relationship', 'equilibrium']","['The co-evolutionary history', 'bats', 'viruses', 'the bat-virus relationship', 'equilibrium']",The co-evolutionary history,bats,viruses,the bat-virus relationship,equilibrium,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. One of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity. Here, we quantify the co-circulation, emergence and sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages in a single swine-producing region in the United States over a span of 9 years (2009–2017). By classifying over 4,000 PRRSV sequences (open-reading frame 5) into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages, we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the PRRSV population, including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008. In addition, lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010, but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014, coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage. The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage. As host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant, this dominant (sub-) lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible. An analysis of patterns of non- synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome, further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus. This has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV that have negative impacts on the swine industry. Constant surveillance on PRRSV occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages. Further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous PRRS viruses could shed further light on PRRSV immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact.","The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage.","['The_sequential_dominance', 'different_lineages', 'three_different_sub-lineages', 'lineage', 'the_sequential_turnover', 'the_dominant_lineage']","['The sequential dominance', 'different lineages', 'three different sub-lineages', 'lineage', 'the sequential turnover', 'the dominant lineage']",The sequential dominance,different lineages,three different sub-lineages,lineage,the sequential turnover,the dominant lineage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced.

No family was found to be ubiquitous and even peptidases thought to be essential for life, such as signal peptidase and methionyl aminopeptides are missing from some clades. There are 33 peptidase families common to archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and are assumed to have originated in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). These include peptidases with different catalytic types, exo- and endopeptidases, peptidases with different tertiary structures and peptidases from different families but with similar structures. This implies that the different catalytic types and structures pre-date LUCA. Other families have had their origins in the ancestors of viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and a number of families have had their origins in the ancestors of particular phyla.

Besides the consensus that spontaneous conversion of normal cellular PrP(C) into misfolded and aggregating PrP(Sc) is the central event in prion disease, an alternative hypothesis suggests the generation of pathological PrP(Sc) by rare translational frameshifting events in the octa-repeat domain of the PrP mRNA. Ribosomal frameshifting most commonly relies on a slippery site and an adjacent stable RNA structure to stall translating ribosome. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the secondary structure of the octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA. Each of the five octa-repeats contains a motif (GGCGGUGGUGGCUGGG) which alone in vitro forms a G-quadruplex. Since the propensity of mRNA to form secondary structure depends on the sequence context, we set to determine the structure of the complete octa-repeat region. We assessed the structure of full-length octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysis by primer extension (SHAPE). Our data show that the PrP octa-repeat mRNA forms stable A-helical hairpins with no evidence of G-quadruplex structure even in the presence of G-quadruplex stabilizing agents.","Besides the consensus that spontaneous conversion of normal cellular PrP(C) into misfolded and aggregating PrP(Sc) is the central event in prion disease, an alternative hypothesis suggests the generation of pathological PrP(Sc) by rare translational frameshifting events in the octa-repeat domain of the PrP mRNA.","['the_consensus', 'spontaneous_conversion', 'normal_cellular_PrP(C', 'PrP(Sc', 'the_central_event', 'prion_disease', 'an_alternative_hypothesis', 'the_generation', 'pathological_PrP(Sc', 'rare_translational_frameshifting_events', 'the_octa-repeat_domain', 'the_PrP', 'mRNA']","['the consensus', 'spontaneous conversion', 'normal cellular PrP(C', 'PrP(Sc', 'the central event', 'prion disease', 'an alternative hypothesis', 'the generation', 'pathological PrP(Sc', 'rare translational frameshifting events', 'the octa-repeat domain', 'the PrP', 'mRNA']",the consensus,spontaneous conversion,normal cellular PrP(C,PrP(Sc,the central event,prion disease,an alternative hypothesis,the generation,pathological PrP(Sc,rare translational frameshifting events,the octa-repeat domain,the PrP,mRNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the establishment of a robust method for expressing transgenes in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, overcoming barriers that have previously hampered DNA delivery and expression. To demonstrate how this method accelerates the study of S. rosetta cell biology, we engineered a panel of fluorescent protein markers that illuminate key features of choanoflagellate cells. We then investigated the localization of choanoflagellate septins, a family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that are hypothesized to regulate the multicellular rosette development in S. rosetta. Fluorescently tagged septins localized to the basal pole of S. rosetta single cells and rosettes in a pattern resembling septin localization in animal epithelia.

We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fos-tagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall.

Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.","The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract.","['the_hypothesis', 'Pedersen', 'FIPV', 'FECV', 'virus_replication', 'the_gastrointestinal_tract']","['the hypothesis', 'Pedersen', 'FIPV', 'FECV', 'virus replication', 'the gastrointestinal tract']",the hypothesis,Pedersen,FIPV,FECV,virus replication,the gastrointestinal tract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness. DESIGN: Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: Madison, Wisconsin, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. METHODS: 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise (EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October, with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence, duration, and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism, health care utilization, and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. RESULTS: Of 413 participants randomized, 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group, 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers, 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 244, 386), 256 (193, 318) for EX, and 336 (268, 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR (p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX (p = 0.042), compared to control, not quite attaining the p<0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group, 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers, and 105 days and 24 visits among controls.

We hypothesized that DAD, the most severe form of acute lung injury, would lead to the highest risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and that a type I immune response would mediate this process. Objectives: Determine whether DAD is associated with CLAD and explore the potential role of CXCR3/ligand biology. Methods: Transbronchial biopsies from all lung transplant recipients were reviewed. The association between the four injury patterns and subsequent outcomes were evaluated using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, and CXCL11/ITAC) were compared between allograft injury patterns and “healthy” biopsies using linear mixed-effects models. The effect of these chemokine alterations on CLAD risk was assessed using Cox models with serial BAL measurements as time-dependent covariates. Measurements and Main Results: There were 1,585 biopsies from 441 recipients with 62 episodes of DAD. An episode of DAD was associated with increased risk of CLAD (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–4.7) and death (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.0). There were marked elevations in BAL CXCR3 ligand concentrations during DAD. Furthermore, prolonged elevation of these chemokines in serial BAL fluid measurements predicted the development of CLAD. Conclusions: DAD is associated with marked increases in the risk of CLAD and death after lung transplantation.

The causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders. OBJECTIVES: To discover an antigen-specific autoimmune response associated with both emphysema and osteoporosis among smokers. METHODS: Replicate nonbiased discovery assays indicated that autoimmunity to glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and cell surface signaling receptor, is present in many smokers. Subject assessments included spirometry, chest CT scans, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and immunoblots for anti-GRP78 IgG. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were isolated from patient plasma by affinity chromatography, leukocyte functions assessed by flow cytometry, and soluble metabolites and mediators measured by immunoassays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies were detected in plasma specimens from 86 (32%) of the 265 smoking subjects. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were singularly prevalent among subjects with radiographic emphysema (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7–5.7, p = 0.003). Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were also associated with osteoporosis (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7–13.3, p = 0.002), and increased circulating bone metabolites (p = 0.006). Among emphysematous subjects, GRP78 protein was an autoantigen of CD4 T-cells, stimulating lymphocyte proliferation (p = 0.0002) and IFN-gamma production (p = 0.03). Patient-derived anti-GRP78 autoantibodies had avidities for osteoclasts and macrophages, and increased macrophage NFkB phosphorylation (p = 0.005) and productions of IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP9 (p = 0.005, 0.007, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular GRP78 autoimmune responses in smokers have numerous biologically-relevant pro-inflammatory and other deleterious actions, and are associated with emphysema and osteoporosis.

We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patient’s CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0–4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total score’s association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05–1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07–1.17, p < 0.001).

However, intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity and viremia of porcine G9 RVAs has remained largely unreported. In this study, colostrum-deprived piglets were orally infected with a porcine G9P[23] or G9P[7] strain. Histopathologically, both strains induced characteristic small intestinal lesions. Degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were observed in the extra-intestinal tissues, but most predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). RVA antigen was continuously detected in the small intestinal mucosa and MLNs, but only transiently in cells of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. Viral RNA levels were much higher in the feces and the MLNs compared to other tissues. The onset of viremia occurred at day post infection (DPI) 1 with the amount of viral RNA reaching its peak at DPI 3 or 5, before decreasing significantly at DPI 7 and remaining detectable until DPI 14. Our data suggest that porcine G9 RVAs have a strong small intestinal tropism, are highly virulent for piglets, have the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal tissues. In addition, MLNs might act as a secondary site for viral amplification and the portal of systemic entry. These results add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs, and the validity of the pig model for use with both human and pig G9 RVAs in further studies.","A rotaviruses (RVAs) are considered important pathogens in pigs and humans, and pigs are hypothesized to be a potential host reservoir for human.","['( RVAs', 'pathogens', 'pigs', 'humans', 'pigs', 'a_potential_host_reservoir', 'human']","['( RVAs', 'pathogens', 'pigs', 'humans', 'pigs', 'a potential host reservoir', 'human']",( RVAs,pathogens,pigs,humans,pigs,a potential host reservoir,human,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFITM3 is known to be essential for restriction of influenza virus infections in both mice and humans. Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote. Since bacterial IFITMs share minimal amino acid identity with human IFITM3, we hypothesized that examination of bacterial IFITMs in human cells would provide insight into the essential characteristics necessary for antiviral activity of IFITMs. We examined IFITMs from Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus for potential antiviral activity. Both of these IFITMs conferred a moderate level of resistance to influenza virus in human cells, identifying them as functional homologues of IFITM3. Analysis of sequence elements shared by bacterial IFITMs and IFITM3 identified two hydrophobic domains, putative S-palmitoylation sites, and conserved phenylalanine residues associated with IFITM3 interactions, which are all necessary for IFITM3 antiviral activity. We observed that, like IFITM3, bacterial IFITMs were S-palmitoylated, albeit to a lesser degree. We also demonstrated the ability of a bacterial IFITM to co-immunoprecipitate with IFITM3 suggesting formation of a complex, and also visualized strong co-localization of bacterial IFITMs with IFITM3. However, the mycobacterial IFITMs lack the endocytic-targeting motif conserved in vertebrate IFITM3. As such, these bacterial proteins, when expressed alone, had diminished colocalization with cathepsin B-positive endolysosomal compartments that are the primary site of IFITM3-dependent influenza virus restriction. Though the precise evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs is not known, our results support a model whereby transfer of a bacterial IFITM gene to eukaryotic cells may have provided a selective advantage against viral infection that was refined through the course of vertebrate evolution to include more robust signals for S-palmitoylation and localization to sites of endocytic virus trafficking.",Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote.,"['Vertebrate_IFITMs', 'a_horizontal_gene_transfer', 'bacteria', 'a_primitive_unicellular_eukaryote']","['Vertebrate IFITMs', 'a horizontal gene transfer', 'bacteria', 'a primitive unicellular eukaryote']",Vertebrate IFITMs,a horizontal gene transfer,bacteria,a primitive unicellular eukaryote,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on genome size, they are far separated from all other ssRNA+ viruses (below 19.6 kb), including the distantly related Arteriviridae (12.7–15.7 kb; ‘small nidoviruses’). Exceptionally for ssRNA+ viruses, large nidoviruses encode a 3′-5′exoribonuclease (ExoN) that was implicated in controlling RNA replication fidelity.

The genome of this enveloped 60–80 nm virus is 20,192 nt and has a nidovirus-like polycistronic organization including two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b followed by several smaller 3′-proximal ORFs. Peptide sequencing assigned three virion proteins to ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are expressed from two 3′-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. The NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b frameshifting signal and various replicative proteins were tentatively mapped to canonical positions in the nidovirus genome. They include six nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains, as well as the ExoN and 2′-O-methyltransferase that are specific to large nidoviruses. NDiV ORF1b also encodes a putative N7-methyltransferase, identified in a subset of large nidoviruses, but not the uridylate-specific endonuclease that – in deviation from the current paradigm - is present exclusively in the currently known vertebrate nidoviruses. Rooted phylogenetic inference by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods indicates that NDiV clusters with roniviruses and that its branch diverged from large nidoviruses early after they split from small nidoviruses. Together these characteristics identify NDiV as the prototype of a new nidovirus family and a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.","Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus.","['Its_acquisition', 'rise', 'the_ancestor', 'large_nidoviruses', 'a_hypothesis', 'evolutionary_support', 'comparative_genomics', 'the_newly_discovered_first_insect-borne_nidovirus']","['Its acquisition', 'rise', 'the ancestor', 'large nidoviruses', 'a hypothesis', 'evolutionary support', 'comparative genomics', 'the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus']",Its acquisition,rise,the ancestor,large nidoviruses,a hypothesis,evolutionary support,comparative genomics,the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of these factors in a population-based sample of adults with ILI. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in community-dwelling Australian adults nested within an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. On presentation with ILI, participants were swabbed for a range of respiratory viruses and asked to return a questionnaire collecting details of household members with or without similar symptoms. We used logistic and Poisson regression to assess the key characteristics of household transmission. RESULTS: 258 participants from multi-occupancy households experienced 279 ILI episodes and returned a questionnaire. Of these, 183 were the primary case in the household allowing assessment of factors associated with transmission. Transmission was significantly associated in univariate analyses with female sex (27% vs. 13%, risk ratio (RR) = 2.13 (1.08, 4.21)) and the presence of a child in the house (33% vs. 17%, RR = 1.90 (1.11, 3.26)).

Vaccinated participants who nonetheless became infected with influenza had a higher SHAP (Incidence RR = 5.24 (2.17, 12.6)). CONCLUSIONS: The increased SHAP in households of vaccinated participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza infection supports the hypothesis that in years of vaccine mismatch, not only is influenza vaccine less protective for the vaccine recipient, but that the population’s immunity is also lower.","The increased SHAP in households of vaccinated participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza infection supports the hypothesis that in years of vaccine mismatch, not only is influenza vaccine less protective for the vaccine recipient, but that the population","['The_increased_SHAP', 'households', 'vaccinated_participants', 'influenza_infection', 'the_hypothesis', 'years', 'vaccine_mismatch', 'influenza_vaccine', 'the_vaccine_recipient', 'the_population']","['The increased SHAP', 'households', 'vaccinated participants', 'influenza infection', 'the hypothesis', 'years', 'vaccine mismatch', 'influenza vaccine', 'the vaccine recipient', 'the population']",The increased SHAP,households,vaccinated participants,influenza infection,the hypothesis,years,vaccine mismatch,influenza vaccine,the vaccine recipient,the population,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.","These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C)","['These_data support', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_temperature', 'the_avian_enteric_tract', '°', 'C']","['These data support', 'the hypothesis', 'the temperature', 'the avian enteric tract', '°', 'C']",These data support,the hypothesis,the temperature,the avian enteric tract,°,C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding.

Here we demonstrate that P102 belongs to a new class of proteins that, at least in Lepidoptera, has a diminished endoribonuclease-U activity probably due to the lack of two out of five catalytically essential residues. We show that the P102 homolog from Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) displays catalytic site residues identical to P102, a residual endoribonuclease-U activity and the ability to form functional amyloids.

Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001).

The species became extinct 28,000years ago, coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) in Europe 40,000years ago. There has been considerable debate surrounding the main causes of the extinction of Neandertals. After at least 200,000years of successful adaption to the climate, flora and fauna of Eurasia, it is not clear why they suddenly failed to survive. For many years, climate change or competition with anatomically modern human (AMH) have been the leading hypotheses. Recently these hypotheses have somewhat fallen out of favour due to the recognition that Neandertals were a highly developed species with complex social structure, culture and technical skills. Were AMHs lucky and survived some catastrophe that eradicated the Neandertals? It seems unlikely that this is the case considering the close timing of the arrival of AMHs and the disappearance of Neandertals. Perhaps the arrival of AMHs also brought additional new non-human microscopic inhabitants to the regions where Neandertals lived and these new inhabitants contributed to the disappearance of the species. We introduce a medical hypothesis that complements other recent explanations for the extinction of Neandertals. After the ancestors of Neandertals left Africa, their immune system adapted gradually to the pathogens in their new Eurasian environment. In contrast, AMHs continued to co-evolve with east African pathogens. More than 200,000years later, AMHs carried pathogens that would have been alien to pre-historic Europe. First contact between long separated populations can be devastating. Recent European and American history provides evidence for similar events, where introduction of viral, protozoan or bacterial pathogens to immunologically naïve populations lead to mass mortality and local population extinction. We propose that a virus, possibly from the family Herpesviridae, contributed to Neandertal extinction.","For many years, climate change or competition with anatomically modern human (AMH) have been the leading hypotheses.","['many_years', 'climate_change', 'competition', 'anatomically_modern_human_(AMH', 'the_leading_hypotheses']","['many years', 'climate change', 'competition', 'anatomically modern human (AMH', 'the leading hypotheses']",many years,climate change,competition,anatomically modern human (AMH,the leading hypotheses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

Since SARS showed a severe case fatality ratio, our concern is to know such a case fatality ratio as soon as possible after a similar outbreak begins. The epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models, and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis. Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. Using the truncated data models to the infected and fatal cases with some censoring time, we may estimate the total (or final) numbers of the patients and deaths, and the case fatality ratio may be estimated by these two numbers. We may also estimate the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries, but this estimate differs from that using the numbers of the patients and deaths, especially when the censoring time is located at early stages. To circumvent this inconsistency, we propose a mixed trunsored model, an extension of the trunsored model, which can use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries simultaneously. The estimate of the case fatality ratio and its confidence interval are easily obtained in a numerical sense. This paper mainly treats the case in Hong Kong. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases in Hong Kong, could be the logistic distribution function among the logistic, log-normal, gamma, and Weibull models. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be 17% in Hong Kong. Worldwide, it is roughly estimated to be about 12–18%, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.","can not only estimate the ratio of the fragile population to the mixed fragile and durable populations or the cured and fatal mixed populations, but also test a hypothesis that the ratio is equal to a prescribed value with ease.","['the_ratio', 'the_fragile_population', 'the_mixed_fragile_and_durable_populations', 'the_cured_and_fatal_mixed_populations', 'a_hypothesis', 'the_ratio', 'a_prescribed_value', 'ease']","['the ratio', 'the fragile population', 'the mixed fragile and durable populations', 'the cured and fatal mixed populations', 'a hypothesis', 'the ratio', 'a prescribed value', 'ease']",the ratio,the fragile population,the mixed fragile and durable populations,the cured and fatal mixed populations,a hypothesis,the ratio,a prescribed value,ease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PEDV spike (S) protein contains two intracellular sorting motifs, YxxΦ (tyrosine-based motif YEVF or YEAF) and KVHVQ at the cytoplasmic tail, yet their functions have not been fully elucidated. Some Vero cell-adapted and/or attenuated PEDV variants contain ablations in these two motifs. We hypothesized that these motifs contribute to viral pathogenicity. By transiently expressing PEDV S proteins with mutations in the motifs, we confirmed that the motif KVHVQ is involved in retention of the S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In addition, we showed that the YxxΦ motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins. These two motifs synergistically regulate the level of S expressed on the cell surface. To investigate their role in viral pathogenicity, we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing deletions or a mutation in the two motifs of the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A): (i) icΔ10aa (ΔYxxΦEKVHVQ), (ii) icΔ5aa (ΔKVHVQ), and (iii) icYA (Y1378A, to an inactivated motif, AEVF). Infection of Vero cells with icΔ10aa resulted in larger syncytia and more virions, with reduced numbers of S protein projections on the surface compared with icPC22A. Furthermore, we orally inoculated five groups of 5-day-old gnotobiotic piglets with the three mutants, icPC22A, or a mock treatment. Mutant icΔ10aa caused less severe diarrhea rate and significantly milder intestinal lesions than icPC22A, icΔ5aa, and icYA. These data suggest that the deletion of both motifs can reduce the virulence of PEDV in piglets. IMPORTANCE Many coronaviruses (CoVs) possess conserved motifs YxxΦ and/or KxHxx/KKxx in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. The KxHxx/KKxx motif has been identified as the ER retrieval signal, but the function of the YxxΦ motif in the intracellular sorting of CoV S proteins remains controversial. In this study, we showed that the YxxΦ of PEDV S protein is an endocytosis signal. Furthermore, using reverse genetics technology, we evaluated its role in PEDV pathogenicity in neonatal piglets. Our results explain one attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants lacking functional YxxΦ and KVHVQ motifs.

Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.","Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses.","['the_original_cow_feces', 'a_group A_rotavirus', 'passage', 'cell_culture', 'such_dual-rotavirus_infections', 'a_role', 'the_pathogenesis_and_host_adaptation', 'rotaviruses']","['the original cow feces', 'a group A rotavirus', 'passage', 'cell culture', 'such dual-rotavirus infections', 'a role', 'the pathogenesis and host adaptation', 'rotaviruses']",the original cow feces,a group A rotavirus,passage,cell culture,such dual-rotavirus infections,a role,the pathogenesis and host adaptation,rotaviruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On various postinoculation or postchallenge days, virus-specific responses of systemic (blood and spleen) and intestinal (mesenteric lymph node and ileal lamina propria) mononuclear cells (MNC) were assessed by lymphoproliferative assays (LPA). After inoculation, 100% of group 1 pigs and 6% of group 2 pigs shed virus. Diarrhea occurred in 95, 12, and 13% of group 1, group 2, and control pigs, respectively. Only groups 1 and 2 developed virus-specific LPA responses prior to challenge. Group 1 developed significantly greater mean virus-specific LPA responses prior to challenge and showed no significant changes in tissue mean LPA responses postchallenge, and 100% were protected against virulent virus challenge. By comparison, both group 2 and controls had significantly lower LPA responses at challenge and both groups showed significant increases in mean LPA responses postchallenge. Eighty-one percent of group 2 and 100% of control pigs shed challenge virus, and both groups developed diarrhea that was similar in severity postchallenge.

We take full advantage of the wealth of available protein structural and functional data to explore the evolution of the proteomic makeup of thousands of cells and viruses. Despite the extremely reduced nature of viral proteomes, we established an ancient origin of the “viral supergroup” and the existence of widespread episodes of horizontal transfer of genetic information. Viruses harboring different replicon types and infecting distantly related hosts shared many metabolic and informational protein structural domains of ancient origin that were also widespread in cellular proteomes. Phylogenomic analysis uncovered a universal tree of life and revealed that modern viruses reduced from multiple ancient cells that harbored segmented RNA genomes and coexisted with the ancestors of modern cells. The model for the origin and evolution of viruses and cells is backed by strong genomic and structural evidence and can be reconciled with existing models of viral evolution if one considers viruses to have originated from ancient cells and not from modern counterparts.","Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data.","['numerous_hypotheses', 'viral_origins', 'none', 'substantive_data']","['numerous hypotheses', 'viral origins', 'none', 'substantive data']",numerous hypotheses,viral origins,none,substantive data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response.

Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus.

Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature.

Changes in gene expression in the hepatopancreas following infection with TSV and Yellow Head Virus (YHV) were assessed using a cDNA microarray containing 2469 putative unigenes. The null hypothesis tested was that significant differences between the transcriptomic responses to viral infection of resistant and sensitive strains would not be detected. This hypothesis was broadly rejected, with the most surprising observation being that the baseline (control, unchallenged) sensitive and resistant strains expressed distinguishable transcriptomic signatures. The resistant line was pre-disposed to lower expression of genes encoding viral (and host) proteins. Many of the genes differentiating resistant and sensitive lines are involved in protein metabolism, cellular trafficking, immune defense and stress response, although it was not possible to clearly identify candidate genes responsible for TSV resistance.

We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces “holes” in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens. The deficiency may be the result of random elimination of PRRSV-specific T cells or the generation of T cells that accept PRRSV epitopes as self-antigens. Loss of helper T cells for virus neutralizing (VN) epitopes can result in the failure of selection for B cells in lymph node germinal centers capable of producing high affinity VN antibodies. Generation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells may also be impaired. Similar to infections with LDV, LCMV, MCMV, HIV-1 and trypanosomes, the host responds to the deficiency of pathogen-specific T cells and perhaps regulatory T cells, by “last ditch” polyclonal B cell activation.

Infection of normal resting B cells with EBV results in activation to lymphoblasts that are phenotypically similar to those generated by physiological stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4. One important difference is that infection leads to the establishment of permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas CD40L/IL-4 blasts have finite proliferation lifespans. To identify early events which might later determine why EBV infected blasts go on to establish transformed cell lines, we performed global transcriptome analyses on resting B cells and on EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts after 7 days culture. As anticipated there was considerable overlap in the transcriptomes of the two types of lymphoblasts when compared to the original resting B cells, reflecting common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Of interest to us was a subset of 255 genes that were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Genes which were more highly expressed in EBV blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for a set of interferon-stimulated genes which on further in silico analyses were found to be repressed by IL-4 in other cell contexts and to be up-regulated in micro-dissected malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma biopsies when compared to their normal germinal center cell counterparts. We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes. This was supported experimentally in our B cell model where IL-4 stimulation partially reversed transcriptional changes which follow EBV infection and it impaired the efficiency of EBV-induced B cell transformation. Taken together, these data suggest that the discordant regulation of interferon and IL-4 pathway genes by EBV that occurs early following infection of B cells has relevance to the development or maintenance of an EBV-associated malignancy.",We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes.,"['EBV', 'IL-4', 'a_common_set', 'genes']","['EBV', 'IL-4', 'a common set', 'genes']",EBV,IL-4,a common set,genes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRF efficiency can vary enormously between different stimulatory structures, but the features that lead to efficient PRF stimulation remain uncertain. To address this question, we studied the structural dynamics of the frameshift signal from West Nile virus (WNV), which stimulates −1 PRF at very high levels and has been proposed to form several different structures, including mutually incompatible pseudoknots and a double hairpin. Using optical tweezers to apply tension to single mRNA molecules, mimicking the tension applied by the ribosome during PRF, we found that the WNV frameshift signal formed an unusually large number of different metastable structures, including all of those previously proposed. From force-extension curve measurements, we mapped 2 mutually exclusive pathways for the folding, each encompassing multiple intermediates. We identified the intermediates in each pathway from length changes and the effects of antisense oligomers blocking formation of specific contacts. Intriguingly, the number of transitions between the different conformers of the WNV frameshift signal was maximal in the range of forces applied by the ribosome during −1 PRF. Furthermore, the occupancy of the pseudoknotted conformations was far too low for static pseudoknots to account for the high levels of −1 PRF.

Since proteins aggregate to perform function, and since protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks model these aggregations, one would expect to uncover new biology from PPI network topology. Hence, using PPI networks to predict protein function and role of protein pathways in disease has received attention. A debate remains open about whether network properties of “biologically central (BC)” genes (i.e., their protein products), such as those involved in aging, cancer, infectious diseases, or signaling and drug-targeted pathways, exhibit some topological centrality compared to the rest of the proteins in the human PPI network. To help resolve this debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its “spine” that connects all other network parts and can thus pass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.",We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network.,"['BC_genes', 'the_human_PPI_network']","['BC genes', 'the human PPI network']",BC genes,the human PPI network,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets. According to this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes (exo-hASCs) on in vitro stimulated T cells. The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helper T cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN-γ production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN-γ release on in vitro stimulated cells.

The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Seba’s short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.

These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the “bag-of-words” model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the “bag-of-words” approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of “bag-of-words” methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative ‘degenerate’ K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A.

As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells.

The objective of this study is to estimate, rather than assume, a threshold level of population density that separates low-density regions from high-density regions on the basis of population loss during an influenza pandemic. We study the case of the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 in India, where over 15 million people died in the short span of less than one year. METHODS: Using data from six censuses for 199 districts of India (n=1194), the country with the largest number of deaths from the influenza of 1918–19, we use a sample-splitting method embedded within a population growth model that explicitly quantifies population loss from the pandemic to estimate a threshold level of population density that separates low-density districts from high-density districts. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a threshold level of population density of 175 people per square mile. A concurrent finding is that districts on the low side of the threshold experienced rates of population loss (3.72%) that were lower than districts on the high side of the threshold (4.69%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper introduces a useful analytic tool to the health geographic literature. It illustrates an application of the tool to demonstrate that it can be useful for pandemic awareness and preparedness efforts. Specifically, it estimates a level of population density above which policies to socially distance, redistribute or quarantine populations are likely to be more effective than they are for areas with population densities that lie below the threshold.",Prior studies have tested for such a role using arbitrary thresholds for population density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher or lower mortality.,"['Prior_studies', 'such_a_role', 'arbitrary_thresholds', 'population_density', 'places', 'higher_or_lower_mortality']","['Prior studies', 'such a role', 'arbitrary thresholds', 'population density', 'places', 'higher or lower mortality']",Prior studies,such a role,arbitrary thresholds,population density,places,higher or lower mortality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clears some PPE (e.g., surgical masks (SM)) as class II medical devices, and regulates some (e.g. surgical head cover) as class I exempt devices. For respiratory protection, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are used. One type of PPE, “surgical N95 respirators”, is a NIOSH-approved FFR that is also cleared by the FDA for use in medical settings. The surgical environment poses unique risks such as the potential for surgical fires. As part of its substantial equivalence determination process, FDA requests testing of flammability and other parameters for SM and surgical N95 respirators. A lack of data regarding flammability of PPE used in healthcare exists. We hypothesize that commonly used PPE, regardless of whether regulated and/or cleared by FDA or not, will pass an industry standard such as the 16 CFR 1610 flammability test. METHODS: Eleven N95 FFR models, eight surgical N95 respirator models, seven SM models, five surgical head cover models, and five PAPR hood models were evaluated for flammability with a 45 degree flammability tester using the 16 CFR 1610 method. Three common fabrics were included for comparison. RESULTS: All of the PPE samples regulated/and or cleared by FDA or not, passed the flammability test at class 1 (normal flammability), meaning they are less likely to burn. Only one of the three common fabrics, a cotton fabric at the lowest basis weight, was class 3 (high flammability). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the study suggest that NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs would likely pass the 16 CFR 1610 flammability standard. Moreover, results suggest that NIOSH is capable of undertaking flammability testing using the 16 CFR 1610 standard as the flammability results NIOSH obtained for N95 FFRs were comparable to the results obtained by a third party independent laboratory.","We hypothesize that commonly used PPE, regardless of whether regulated and/or cleared by FDA or not, will pass an industry standard such as the 16 CFR 1610 flammability test.","['PPE', 'FDA', 'an_industry_standard']","['PPE', 'FDA', 'an industry standard']",PPE,FDA,an industry standard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm(3)) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as “speech superemitters,” consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.","Mechanistic hypotheses about airborne infectious disease transmission have traditionally emphasized the role of coughing and sneezing, which are dramatic expiratory events that yield both easily visible droplets and large quantities of particles too small to see by eye.","['Mechanistic_hypotheses', 'the_role', 'sneezing', 'dramatic_expiratory_events', 'yield', 'both_easily_visible_droplets', 'large_quantities', 'particles', 'eye']","['Mechanistic hypotheses', 'the role', 'sneezing', 'dramatic expiratory events', 'yield', 'both easily visible droplets', 'large quantities', 'particles', 'eye']",Mechanistic hypotheses,the role,sneezing,dramatic expiratory events,yield,both easily visible droplets,large quantities,particles,eye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among all open reading frames (orfs) of this virus, the orf3a is the largest, and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids, named as 3a protein. Sequence analysis suggests that the orf3a aligned to one calcium pump present in Plasmodium falciparum and the enzyme glutamine synthetase found in Leptospira interrogans. This sequence similarity was found to be limited only to amino acid residues 209–264 which form the cytoplasmic domain of the orf3a. Furthermore, this region was predicted to be involved in the calcium binding. Owing to this hypothesis, we were driven to establish its calcium binding property in vitro. Here, we expressed and purified the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein, called Cyto3a, as a recombinant His-tagged protein in the E. coli. The calcium binding nature was established by performing various staining methods such as ruthenium red and stains-all. 45Ca overlay method was also done to further support the data. Since the 3a protein forms ion channels, we were interested to see any conformational changes occurring in the Cyot3a upon calcium binding, using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. These studies clearly indicate a significant change in the conformation of the Cyto3a protein after binding with calcium. Our results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein of SARS-CoV binds calcium in vitro, causing a change in protein conformation.","Owing to this hypothesis, we were driven to establish its calcium binding property in vitro.",['its_calcium_binding_property'],['its calcium binding property'],its calcium binding property,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991). Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C3H, and C57BL/6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM2-related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the MHVR and mmCGM2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin-like domains [MHVR(2d)] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4d)L]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM2 and MHVR(2d), and the MHVR(4d)L isoform served as functional virus receptors for MHV-A59.

In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative.

Recent advances in utilizing sensitive PCR detection methods have allowed more rigorous testing of the causality hypothesis of virus infection leading to asthma, but the evidence is still equivocal. Various exceptions and inconsistencies in the clinical trials are discussed in light of new guidelines for subject inclusion/exclusion in hopes of providing some standardization. In spite of past failures in vaccination and disappointing results of some clinical trials, the new strategies for prophylaxis including RNA interference and targeted delivery of microbicides offer a large dose of hope to a world suffering from an increasing incidence of asthma and a huge burden of healthcare cost and loss of quality of life.","Recent advances in utilizing sensitive PCR detection methods have allowed more rigorous testing of the causality hypothesis of virus infection leading to asthma, but the evidence is still equivocal.","['Recent_advances', 'sensitive_PCR_detection_methods', 'more_rigorous_testing', 'the_causality_hypothesis', 'virus_infection', 'asthma', 'the_evidence']","['Recent advances', 'sensitive PCR detection methods', 'more rigorous testing', 'the causality hypothesis', 'virus infection', 'asthma', 'the evidence']",Recent advances,sensitive PCR detection methods,more rigorous testing,the causality hypothesis,virus infection,asthma,the evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe ARDS. METHODS: Eighteen male Beagles were studied under mechanical ventilation with anesthesia. Severe ARDS was induced by repetitive oleic acid infusion. After lung injury, Beagles were randomly assigned into spontaneous breathing group (BIPAP(SB)) and abdominal muscle paralysis group (BIPAP(AP)). All groups were ventilated with BIPAP model for 8h, and the high pressure titrated to reached a tidal volume of 6ml/kg, the low pressure was set at 10 cmH(2)O, with I:E ratio 1:1, and respiratory rate adjusted to a PaCO(2) of 35–60 mmHg. Six Beagles without ventilator support comprised the control group. Respiratory variables, end-expiratory volume (EELV) and gas exchange were assessed during mechanical ventilation. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 in lung tissue and plasma were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Lung injury scores were determined at end of the experiment. RESULTS: For the comparable ventilator setting, as compared with BIPAP(SB) group, the BIPAP(AP) group presented higher EELV (427±47 vs. 366±38 ml) and oxygenation index (293±36 vs. 226±31 mmHg), lower levels of IL-6(216.6±48.0 vs. 297.5±71.2 pg/ml) and IL-8(246.8±78.2 vs. 357.5±69.3 pg/ml) in plasma, and lower express levels of IL-6 mRNA (15.0±3.8 vs. 21.2±3.7) and IL-8 mRNA (18.9±6.8 vs. 29.5±7.9) in lung tissues. In addition, less lung histopathology injury were revealed in the BIPAP(AP) group (22.5±2.0 vs. 25.2±2.1).

This has been due to a combination of factors including the emergence of highly virulent zoonotic pathogens, such as Hendra, Nipah, SARS and Ebola viruses, and the high rate of detection of a large number of previously unknown viral sequences in bat specimens. As bats have ancient evolutionary origins and are the only flying mammals, it has been hypothesized that some of their unique biological features may have made them especially suitable hosts for different viruses. So the question ‘Are bats different, special or exceptional?’ has become a focal point in the field of virology, bat biology and virus-host co-evolution. In this brief review, we examine the topic in a relatively unconventional way, that is, our discussion will be based on both scientific discoveries and theoretical predictions. This approach was chosen partially because the data in this field are so limited that it is impossible to conduct a useful review based on published results only and also because we believe it is important to provoke original, speculative or even controversial ideas or theories in this important field of research.","As bats have ancient evolutionary origins and are the only flying mammals, it has been hypothesized that some of their unique biological features may have made them especially suitable hosts for different viruses.","['bats', 'ancient_evolutionary_origins', 'the_only_flying_mammals', 'hosts', 'different_viruses']","['bats', 'ancient evolutionary origins', 'the only flying mammals', 'hosts', 'different viruses']",bats,ancient evolutionary origins,the only flying mammals,hosts,different viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions.

The immunological hallmarks in PRRSV-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type I interferons (IFNs-α/β) and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses, indicating that PRRSV has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. Type I IFNs are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity.

These various processes must be properly balanced to ensure efficient viral proliferation. To achieve this, higher-order RNA structures near the termini of a variety of RNA virus genomes are thought to play a key role in regulating the specificity and efficiency of viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we have analyzed the signals for minus-strand RNA synthesis in the prototype of the arterivirus family, equine arteritis virus (EAV). Using site-directed mutagenesis and an EAV reverse genetics system, we have demonstrated that a stem-loop structure near the 3′ terminus of the EAV genome is required for RNA synthesis. We have also obtained evidence for an essential pseudoknot interaction between the loop region of this stem-loop structure and an upstream hairpin residing in the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein. We propose that the formation of this pseudoknot interaction may constitute a molecular switch that could regulate the specificity or timing of viral RNA synthesis. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that phylogenetic analysis predicted the formation of similar pseudoknot interactions near the 3′ end of all known arterivirus genomes, suggesting that this interaction has been conserved in evolution.","This hypothesis is supported by the fact that phylogenetic analysis predicted the formation of similar pseudoknot interactions near the 3′ end of all known arterivirus genomes, suggesting that this interaction has been conserved in evolution.","['This_hypothesis', 'the_fact', 'phylogenetic_analysis', 'the_formation', 'similar_pseudoknot_interactions', 'the_3′_end', 'all_known_arterivirus_genomes', 'this_interaction', 'evolution']","['This hypothesis', 'the fact', 'phylogenetic analysis', 'the formation', 'similar pseudoknot interactions', 'the 3′ end', 'all known arterivirus genomes', 'this interaction', 'evolution']",This hypothesis,the fact,phylogenetic analysis,the formation,similar pseudoknot interactions,the 3′ end,all known arterivirus genomes,this interaction,evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, α-helical C-terminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.","Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae.","['C', 'viral_replication', 'PNT', 'C', 'de_novo', 'PNT', 'the_ancestor', 'Paramyxovirinae']","['C', 'viral replication', 'PNT', 'C', 'de novo', 'PNT', 'the ancestor', 'Paramyxovirinae']",C,viral replication,PNT,C,de novo,PNT,the ancestor,Paramyxovirinae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities. We expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model. Following the heat and RNAse treatment, PEDV virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells, indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro. Strong PEDV spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets. Upon challenge, all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology, while the unvaccinated controls were not. The vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge; nor did they develop intestinal lesions.

Comparison of these aptamers to multiple HCV genomes revealed the presence of a conserved terminal loop motif within short RNA stem-loop structures. We postulated that interactions of these motifs, as well as sub-motifs which were present in HCV genomes at statistically significant levels, with the Core protein may drive virion assembly. We mutated 8 of these predicted motifs within the HCV infectious molecular clone JFH-1, thereby producing a range of mutant viruses predicted to possess altered RNA secondary structures. RNA replication and viral titre were unaltered in viruses possessing only one mutated structure. However, infectivity titres were decreased in viruses possessing a higher number of mutated regions.

Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.p. and postpartum (p.p.). Health status and milk production were monitored p.p. Serum cyanocobalamin concentration increased in groups C6 and C3 p.p. Multiple daily i.v. injections of Catosal before parturition increased p.p. glucose availability, as evaluated by p.p. serum glucose concentration, and decreased peripheral fat mobilization and ketone body formation, as evaluated by p.p. serum nonesterified fatty acid and β-OH butyrate concentrations. The number of puerperal infections in the first 5 d after calving was decreased in group C6, relative to group C0.

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.","In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response.","['this_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'CoV_ExoN', 'the_innate_immune_response']","['this study', 'the hypothesis', 'CoV ExoN', 'the innate immune response']",this study,the hypothesis,CoV ExoN,the innate immune response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Series paper examines the evidence for immune dysregulation in catatonia. Activation of the innate immune system is associated with mutism, withdrawal, and psychomotor retardation, which constitute the neurovegetative features of catatonia. Evidence is sparse and conflicting for acute-phase activation in catatonia, and whether this feature is secondary to immobility is unclear. Various viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections have been associated with catatonia, but it is primarily linked to CNS infections. The most common cause of autoimmune catatonia is N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, which can account for the full spectrum of catatonic features. Autoimmunity appears to cause catatonia less by systemic inflammation than by the downstream effects of specific actions on extracellular antigens.

Unexpectedly, all five DP molecules, originally selected only on the basis of their frequency in human populations, were found to share largely overlapping peptide motifs. Testing panels of known DP epitopes and a panel of peptides spanning a set of Phleum pratense Ags revealed that these molecules also share largely overlapping peptide-binding repertoires. This demonstrates that a previously hypothesized DP supertype extends far beyond what was originally envisioned and includes at least three additional very common DP specificities.

In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments.

We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid. In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice. Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole.

We previously demonstrated that pathogenic SIVmac239 and a live-attenuated, quintuple deglycosylated Env mutant (Δ5G) virus target CD4(+) T cells residing in different tissues during acute infection. SIVmac239 and Δ5G preferentially infected distinct CD4(+) T cells in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and within the lamina propria of the small intestine, respectively (C. Sugimoto et al., J Virol 86:9323–9336, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00948-12). Here, we studied the host responses relevant to SIV targeting of CXCR3(+) CCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells in SLOs. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that Th1-polarized inflammatory responses, defined by expression of CXCR3 chemokines, were distinctly induced in the SIVmac239-infected animals. Consistent with robust expression of CXCL10, CXCR3(+) T cells were depleted from blood in the SIVmac239-infected animals. We also discovered that elevation of CXCL10 expression in blood and SLOs was secondary to the induction of CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and MAC387(+) macrophages, respectively. Since the significantly higher levels of SIV infection in SLOs occurred with a massive accumulation of infiltrated MAC387(+) macrophages, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and residential macrophages near high endothelial venules, the results highlight critical roles of innate/inflammatory responses in SIVmac239 infection. Restricted infection in SLOs by Δ5G also suggests that glycosylation of Env modulates innate/inflammatory responses elicited by cells of monocyte/macrophage/DC lineages. IMPORTANCE We previously demonstrated that a pathogenic SIVmac239 virus and a live-attenuated, deglycosylated mutant Δ5G virus infected distinct CD4(+) T cell subsets in SLOs and the small intestine, respectively (C. Sugimoto et al., J Virol 86:9323–9336, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00948-12). Accordingly, infections with SIVmac239, but not with Δ5G, deplete CXCR3(+) CCR5(+) CD4(+) T (Th1) cells during the primary infection, thereby compromising the cellular immune response. Thus, we hypothesized that distinct host responses are elicited by the infections with two different viruses. We found that SIVmac239 induced distinctly higher levels of inflammatory Th1 responses than Δ5G. In particular, SIVmac239 infection elicited robust expression of CXCL10, a chemokine for CXCR3(+) cells, in CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and MAC387(+) macrophages recently infiltrated in SLOs. In contrast, Δ5G infection elicited only modest inflammatory responses. These results suggest that the glycosylation of Env modulates the inflammatory/Th1 responses through the monocyte/macrophage subsets and elicits marked differences in SIV infection and clinical outcomes.","Thus, we hypothesized that distinct host responses are elicited by the infections with two different viruses.","['distinct_host_responses', 'the_infections', 'two_different_viruses']","['distinct host responses', 'the infections', 'two different viruses']",distinct host responses,the infections,two different viruses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated previously that UL24 of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is important for the dispersal of nucleolin from nucleolar foci throughout the nuclei of infected cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of UL24 localizes to nuclei and can disperse nucleolin in the absence of any other viral proteins. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that highly conserved residues in UL24 are important for the ability of the protein to modify the nuclear distribution of nucleolin. We constructed a panel of substitution mutations in UL24 and tested their effects on nucleolin staining patterns. We found that modified UL24 proteins exhibited a range of subcellular distributions. Mutations associated with a wild-type localization pattern for UL24 correlated with high levels of nucleolin dispersal. Interestingly, mutations targeting two regions, namely, within the first homology domain and overlapping or near the previously identified PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease motif, caused the most altered UL24 localization pattern and the most drastic reduction in its ability to disperse nucleolin. Viral mutants corresponding to the substitutions G121A and E99A/K101A both exhibited a syncytial plaque phenotype at 39°C. vUL24-E99A/K101A replicated to lower titers than did vUL24-G121A or KOS.

Multievent capture-recapture models were used to determine the factors influencing bat rabies transmission as this method accounts for imperfect detection and uncertainty in disease states. Considering the period of study, analyses revealed that survival and recapture probabilities were not affected by the serological status of individuals, confirming the capacity of bats to be exposed to lyssaviruses without dying. Five bats have been found with EBLV-1 RNA in the saliva at the start of the study, suggesting they were caught during virus excretion period. Among these bats, one was interestingly recaptured one year later and harbored a seropositive status. Along the survey, some others bats have been observed to both seroconvert (i.e. move from a negative to a positive serological status) and serorevert (i.e. move from a positive to a negative serological status). Peak of seroprevalence reached 34% and 70% in site A and B respectively. On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony. Seroprevalence were affected by significantly higher seroprevalence in summer than in spring. The maximum time observed between successive positive serological statuses of a bat demonstrated the potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least 4 years. At last, EBLV-1 serological status transitions have been shown driven by age category with higher seroreversion frequencies in adults than in juvenile. Juveniles and female adults seemed indeed acting as distinct drivers of the rabies virus dynamics, hypothesis have been addressed but their exact role in the EBLV-1 transmission still need to be specified.","On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony.","['the_2_sites', 'global_decrease', 'seroprevalence', 'the_study_period', 'oscillation_intervals', 'approximately_2–3_years', 'the_oscillation_infection_dynamics', 'a_Myotis_myotis_colony']","['the 2 sites', 'global decrease', 'seroprevalence', 'the study period', 'oscillation intervals', 'approximately 2–3 years', 'the oscillation infection dynamics', 'a Myotis myotis colony']",the 2 sites,global decrease,seroprevalence,the study period,oscillation intervals,approximately 2–3 years,the oscillation infection dynamics,a Myotis myotis colony,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Symptomatic treatment is minimally effective. An anecdotal report of rapid clearing of the common cold of recent onset after intranasal application of imiquimod in several subjects by one of the authors, made us test the hypothesis that this treatment works through the secretion of interferon by the nasal mucosa. We decided to do an animal study in primates (Indian Macaca Mulata): 5 treatment and 3 control animals were used. Imiquimod or placebo was massaged into the nares of the animals and periodic samples of post‐nasal fluid were taken and measurements for Interferon α (IFNα) and Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) were made by ELISA methods, and kinetic studies. IFNα mRNA was also isolated and analyzed by quantitative competitive RT‐PCR. The internal standard was constructed to be complementary to and compete with oligonucleotide primers and for amplification of target sequences. One intranasal application of imiquimod rapidly (1–4 h) induced high levels of mRNA for IFNα, and minimal levels in the control animals. Rapid induction of INFα, and proportional increase of TNFα sustained for 4 and 6 h respectively were noted. No adverse reactions to treatment were found in macaques during this short period of intranasal imiquimod usage (except in one macaque with a short period of lacrimation). No animal had cytotoxic effects when examined at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h or 48 h, except one animal, which had an episode of lacrimation for 6hr post treatment. Thus both safety and efficacy of short treatment with imiquimod is proven in this animal model. Proof of principle for intranasal treatment of the common cold with imiquimod is shown.

Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimes. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks.

IL-6(−)(/)(−) and IL-6(+/+) mice of resistant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H-2(b) haplotype intracerebrally infected with Theiler's virus cleared the infection normally without development of viral persistence, lethal neuronal infection, or late phase demyelination. In contrast, infection of IL-6(−)(/)(−) mice on a susceptible H-2(q) haplotype resulted in frequent deaths and severe neurologic deficits within 2 weeks of infection as compared with infected IL-6(+/+)H-2(q) littermate controls. Morphologic analysis demonstrated dramatic injury to anterior horn neurons of IL-6(−)(/)(−)H-2(q) mice at 12 d after infection. Infectious viral titers in the CNS (brain and spinal cord combined) were equivalent between IL-6(−)(/)(−)H-2(q) and IL-6(+/+)H-2(q) mice. In contrast, more viral RNA was detected in the spinal cord of IL-6(−)(/)(−) mice compared with IL-6(+/+) H-2(q) mice. Virus antigen was localized predominantly to anterior horn cells in infected IL-6(−)(/)(−)H-2(q) mice. IL-6 deletion did not affect the humoral response directed against virus, nor did it affect the expression of CD4, CD8, MHC class I, or MHC class II in the CNS. Importantly, IL-6 was expressed by astrocytes of infected IL-6(+/+)mice but not in astrocytes of IL-6(−)(/)(−) mice or uninfected IL-6(+/+) mice. Furthermore, expression of various chemokines was robust at 12 d after infection in both H-2(b) and H-2(q)IL-6(−)(/)(−)mice, indicating that intrinsic CNS inflammatory responses did not depend on the presence of IL-6.

Infection of low passage bovine kidney (BK) or established bovine kidney cells (CRIB) with Sendai virus has consistently led to high levels of IFN-β1 RNA. Conversely, infection of CRIB cells, but not BK cells, with BHV-1 increased IFN-β3 RNA levels and to a lesser extent the other two IFN-β subtypes. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide resulted in higher levels of IFN-β1 and IFN-β2 RNA levels after BHV-1 infection. Further studies demonstrated that BHV-1 immediate early and/or early genes were primarily responsible for inhibiting the IFN response in BK cells. The three bovine IFN-β promoters were cloned upstream of a reporter gene construct, and their properties analyzed in transient transfection assays. Only the IFN-β3 promoter was trans-activated by IRF3 (interferon responsive factor 3). IRF7 and double stranded RNA (polyIC) stimulated IFN-β1 and IFN-β3 promoter activity, but not IFN-β2. Relative to the human IFN-β promoter, the IFN-β3 promoter contained fewer nucleotide differences in the positive regulatory domain III (PRD III), PRD IV, and PRD I compared to the IFN-β1 and IFN-β2 promoter.

Infection is the major cause of metabolic decompensation in patients with IEM. We hypothesized that activation of the immune system during infection leads to further perturbations in end-organ metabolism resulting in increased morbidity. To address this, we established model systems of metabolic decompensation due to infection. Using these systems, we have described the pathologic mechanisms of metabolic decompensation as well as changes in hepatic metabolic reserve associated with infection. First and foremost, our studies have demonstrated that the liver experiences a significant local innate immune response during influenza infection that modulates hepatic metabolism. Based on these findings, we are the first to suggest that the role of the liver as a metabolic and immunologic organ is central in the pathophysiology of metabolic decompensation due to infection in IEM. The dual function of the liver as a major metabolic regulator and a lymphoid organ responsible for immunosurveillance places this organ at risk for hepatotoxicity. Mobilization of hepatic reserve and the regenerative capacity of a healthy liver compensates for this calculated risk. However, activation of the hepatic innate immune system may be deleterious in IEM. Based on this assertion, strategies aimed at modulating the innate immune response may be a viable target for intervention in the treatment of hepatic metabolic decompensation.",We hypothesized that activation of the immune system during infection leads to further perturbations in end-organ metabolism resulting in increased morbidity.,"['that_activation', 'the_immune_system', 'infection', 'further_perturbations', 'end-organ_metabolism', 'increased_morbidity']","['that activation', 'the immune system', 'infection', 'further perturbations', 'end-organ metabolism', 'increased morbidity']",that activation,the immune system,infection,further perturbations,end-organ metabolism,increased morbidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate this transmission route. CMt-positive saliva and blood samples were obtained from three prednisolone-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were infected intraperitoneally with CMt. Five SPF cats were inoculated with CMt-positive saliva or blood subcutaneously to mimic cat bites, and five cats were inoculated orally with blood or oronasally with saliva to mimic social contact. Blood samples were monitored for CMt infection using quantitative real-time PCR and for seroconversion using a novel western blot assay. Neither oronasal nor subcutaneous inoculation with CMt-positive saliva led to CMt infection in the recipient cats, as determined by PCR, independent of prior prednisolone treatment. However, when blood containing the same CMt dose was given subcutaneously, 4 of the 5 cats became PCR-positive, while none of the 5 cats inoculated orally with up to 500 μL of CMt-positive blood became PCR-positive. Subsequently, the latter cats were successfully subcutaneously infected with blood. All 13 CMt-exposed cats seroconverted.

These groups include picorna-, alpha-, and coronaviruses infecting animals and como-, poty-, tobamo-, tricorna-, hordei-, and furoviruses of plants, totalling 21 viruses. It has been demonstrated that the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins constitute three distinct families, the sequences within each family being similar to each other at a statistically highly significant level. A lower, but still valid similarity has also been revealed between the families. An overall alignment has been generated, which includes several highly conserved sequence stretches. The two most prominent of the latter contain the socalled “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif, with four of the five invariant amino acid residues observed within these sequences. These observations, taken together with the results of comparative analysis of the positions occupied by respective proteins (domains) in viral multidomain proteins, suggest that all the NTP-motif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses are homologous, constituting a highly diverged monophyletic group. In this group the “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif are the most conserved sequences and, by inference, should play the principal role in the functioning of the proteins. A hypothesis is proposed that all these proteins posses NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, performing some NTP-dependent function in viral RNA replication.

HNPs are tridisulfide-linked antimicrobial peptides involved in the intracellular killing of organisms phagocytosed by neutrophils. The peptides are produced as inactive precursors (proHNPs) which are processed to active microbicides by as yet unidentified convertases. ProHNP1 was expressed in E. coli and the affinity-purified propeptide isolated as two species, one containing mature HNP1 sequence with native disulfide linkages (“folded proHNP1”) and the other containing non-native disulfide linked proHNP1 conformers (misfolded proHNP1). Native HNP1, liberated by CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1, was microbicidal against Staphylococcus aureus, but the peptide derived from misfolded proHNP1 was inactive. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension. NE and PR3 cleaved folded proHNP1 to produce a peptide indistinguishable from native HNP1 purified from neutrophils, and the microbicidal activities of in vitro derived and natural HNP1 peptides were equivalent.

The integrity of the gut epithelium and competence of adaptive immune responses are notoriously compromised during sepsis, and the prevalent assumption in the scientific and medical community is that intestinal commensals have a detrimental role in the systemic inflammation and susceptibility to nosocomial infections seen in critically ill, septic patients. However, breakthroughs in the last decade provide strong credence to the idea that our mucosal microbiome plays an essential role in adaptive immunity, where a human host and its prokaryotic colonists seem to exist in a carefully negotiated armistice with compromises and benefits that go both ways. In this review, we re-examine the notion that intestinal contents are the driving force of critical illness. An overview of the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system is provided, with a special focus on the impact of commensals in priming and the careful balance between normal intestinal flora and pathogenic organisms residing in the gut microbiome. Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the gut, along with compromises in epithelial integrity. As a result, normal antigen sampling becomes impaired, and proliferative cues are intermixed with inhibitory signals. This situates the microbiome, the gut, and its complex immune network of cells and bacteria, at the center of aberrant immune responses during and after sepsis.","Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the gut, along with compromises in epithelial integrity.","['the_data', 'hand', 'sepsis', 'imbalances', 'microbial_populations', 'the_gut', 'compromises', 'epithelial_integrity']","['the data', 'hand', 'sepsis', 'imbalances', 'microbial populations', 'the gut', 'compromises', 'epithelial integrity']",the data,hand,sepsis,imbalances,microbial populations,the gut,compromises,epithelial integrity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two cases are reported to exemplify how feeder swine exposed to points of concentration such as holding areas, sales barns and auctions can play an important role in the epizootiology of transmissible gastroenteritis. A third field case is reported as an example of an outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis beginning in feeder swine and then spreading to baby pigs on the farm. All baby pigs died that were born during the acute phase of the outbreak in the feeder swine. Baby pigs born shortly after the clinical signs had abated in the herd, and from sows that had been exposed orally to virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus and vaccinated with a commercial transmissible gastroenteritis vaccine ten days before farrowing, survived. This was explained by a combination of a decrease in the amount of virus shed in the environment and the immunity induced in the sows. These observations of field outbreaks of transmissible gastroenteritis combined with recently reported experimental studies lend strong support to the hypothesis of a reservoir for transmissible gastroenteritis virus in feeder pigs.

Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signaling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of virus-host interactions and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus.

For the etiopathogenesis of KD, there is no agreement even as to whether KD is an infectious disease or an immune-mediated disease. The epidemiologic characteristics of KD, including the strict predilection of age in all ethnic groups and the gradually increased incidence after the KD emergence, suggest that KD is affected by the immune maturation in early childhood that may be determined by genetic factors, and KD is also affected by the changed environmental circumstances such as improved public hygiene. We postulated that the pathogenesis of KD is a hyperimmune reaction in genetically susceptible children to the variants of normal flora, which are induced by the environmental factors. Using this hypothesis, we might partly explain the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of KD.

These disparate effects elicited by O3 exposure depend, in large part, on the experimental design used, the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied. Despite the apparent contradictions, a general pattern of response to O3 exposure can be recognized. Most studies indicate that continuous O3 exposure leads to an early (days 0-3) impairment of immune responsiveness followed, with continued exposures, by a form of adaptation to O3 that results in a re-establishment of the immune response. The effects of O3 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which O3 exposure occurred. Whereas O3 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen, O3 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen.

METHODS—Prospective observational study over 1 year set in the Lewisham district of south east London. The daily attendance rate of children with acute wheeze at the accident and emergency department of Lewisham Hospital was related to local measurements of ozone, hydrocarbon species, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and small particulate matter with diameter <10µm (PM(10)). RESULTS—An inverse relation was found between the air pollutants and ozone. After seasonal and meteorological adjustment a non-linear U shaped trend was found between incidence of wheeze and ozone. The trend was significant in children <2 years of age but not in older children. In the younger age group, after adjustment for season, temperature, wind speed, and respiratory infection, the incidence relative to that at the mean daily ozone concentration of 32.7 µg/m(3), was estimated to increase by 65% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 22% to 122%) at an ozone concentration of 5 µg/m(3) (1.5 SDs below the mean) and by 63% (95%CI −6% to 184%) at 80( )µg/m(3) (2.5 SDs above the mean). For several hydrocarbons there were significant positive linear relations found, again in children <2 years of age but not older children. For benzene, the incidence increased by 8% (95% CI 2 to 13%) per SD (SD 2.8 µg/m(3)) increase in benzene concentration. A same day association between incidence and ozone was found to be the most significant but for other pollutants a lag of 2 days gave the most significant associations. No significant association was found for the non-hydrocarbon pollutants including SO(2), NO(2), and PM(10). CONCLUSIONS—A U shaped relation was found between ozone and the incidence of wheezy episodes in young children. Certain hydrocarbon pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere when ozone concentrations are low, and are associated with childhood wheezy episodes. However, the U shaped association of ozone on incidence cannot be explained by these other pollutants. The finding supports an earlier finding that incidences of wheeze are at a minimum when ozone concentrations are 30-40 µg/m(3).

In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China. METHODS: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.","According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.","['the_latest_criterion', 'the_International_Committee', 'Taxonomy', 'Viruses', 'ICTV', 'BtHEVMd2350', 'an_independent_genotype', 'the_species Orthohepevirus_D', 'the_family_Hepeviridae']","['the latest criterion', 'the International Committee', 'Taxonomy', 'Viruses', 'ICTV', 'BtHEVMd2350', 'an independent genotype', 'the species Orthohepevirus D', 'the family Hepeviridae']",the latest criterion,the International Committee,Taxonomy,Viruses,ICTV,BtHEVMd2350,an independent genotype,the species Orthohepevirus D,the family Hepeviridae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This led us to studies documenting a cell-autonomous role for IRF-1 in gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in primary macrophages. This role of IRF-1 in the inhibition of MNV replication by IFN-γ is independent of IFN-αβ signaling. While the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT-1 was also required for IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in vitro, class II transactivator (CIITA), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) were not required.

Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations.

Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances.

M. haemolytica cells initially colonize the tonsillar crypts in the upper respiratory tract of cattle, from where they can subsequently descend into the lungs to cause disease. Many bacteria exist as biofilms inside their hosts. We hypothesize that M. haemolytica colonization of cattle during its commensal state may include biofilm formation. To begin to assess this possibility, we developed an in vitro system to study biofilm formation directly on bovine respiratory epithelial cells. Using fixed primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells, we observed M. haemolytica biofilm formation after a 48h incubation period at 37°C. Addition of mucin, the main component of mucus present in the upper respiratory tract, decreased M. haemolytica biofilm formation on bovine epithelial cells. We investigated the effects of prior viral infection of the epithelial cells on subsequent biofilm formation by M. haemolytica and found negligible effects.

Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin domain, >10(5) binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced. Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal Shannon entropies (range: 0.3–3.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1) supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and consensus biases.

Vpu forms cation-specific ion channels in host cells, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. An understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through Vpu is desirable, but remains limited because of the unavailability of an experimental structure of the channel. Using a structure of the pentameric form of Vpu – modeled and validated based on available experimental data – umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations (cumulative simulation time of more than 0.4 µs) were employed to elucidate the energetics and the molecular mechanism of ion transport in Vpu. Free energy profiles corresponding to the permeation of Na(+) and K(+) were found to be similar to each other indicating lack of ion selection, consistent with previous experimental studies. The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments. A two-dimensional free energy landscape has been computed to model multiple ion permeation, based on which a mechanism for ion conduction is proposed. It is shown that only one ion can pass through the channel at a time. This, along with a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, explains the slow kinetics of ion conduction. The results are consistent with previous conductance studies that showed Vpu to be a weakly conducting ion channel.","The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments.","['The_Ser23_residue', 'ion_transport', 'two_mechanisms', 'a_weak_binding_site', 'the_effective_hydrophilic_length', 'the_channel', 'experiments']","['The Ser23 residue', 'ion transport', 'two mechanisms', 'a weak binding site', 'the effective hydrophilic length', 'the channel', 'experiments']",The Ser23 residue,ion transport,two mechanisms,a weak binding site,the effective hydrophilic length,the channel,experiments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocrotaline (MCT) treatment of mice for eight weeks resulted in significant increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricle/left ventricle + septal (RV/LV+S) weight ratio and muscularization of pulmonary vessels. Administration of a lentiviral vector containing ACE2 (lenti-ACE2) seven days prior to MCT treatment prevented the increases in RVSP (Control: 25 ± 1 mmHg; MCT: 44 ± 5 mmHg; MCT+ACE2: 26 ± 1 mmHg, n=6, p<0.05) and RV/LV +S weight ratio (Control: 0.25 ± 0.01 mg/mg; MCT: 0.31 ± 0.01 mg/mg; MCT+ACE2: 0.26 ± 0.01mg/mg, n=8, p<0.05). A significant attenuation in muscularization of pulmonary vessels induced by MCT was also observed in animals overexpressing ACE2. These beneficial effects were associated with an increase in the AT(2) receptor/AT(1) receptor mRNA ratio. Also, PH-induced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly attenuated by lenti-ACE2 treatment. Furthermore, ACE2 gene transfer in mice following six weeks of MCT treatment resulted in significant reversal of RVSP. These observations demonstrate that ACE2 overexpression prevents and reverses RVSP and associated pathophysiology in MCT-induced PH by a mechanism involving a shift from the vasoconstrictive, proliferative and fibrotic axis to the vasoprotective axis of the renin-angiotensin system and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Abundant presence of ACE2 in the lungs, and its impressive effect in the prevention of acute lung injury, led us to test the hypothesis that pulmonary overexpression of this enzyme could produce beneficial outcomes against PH.","['Abundant_presence', 'ACE2', 'the_lungs', 'the_prevention', 'acute_lung_injury', 'the_hypothesis', 'pulmonary_overexpression', 'this_enzyme', 'beneficial_outcomes', 'PH']","['Abundant presence', 'ACE2', 'the lungs', 'the prevention', 'acute lung injury', 'the hypothesis', 'pulmonary overexpression', 'this enzyme', 'beneficial outcomes', 'PH']",Abundant presence,ACE2,the lungs,the prevention,acute lung injury,the hypothesis,pulmonary overexpression,this enzyme,beneficial outcomes,PH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of the ribosome to change translational reading frames in the −1 direction (−1 PRF) is employed by many positive strand RNA viruses, including economically important plant viruses and many human pathogens, such as retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, and coronaviruses, e.g., the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in order to properly express their genomes. −1 PRF is programmed by a bipartite signal embedded in the mRNA and includes a heptanucleotide “slip site” over which the paused ribosome “backs up” by one nucleotide, and a downstream stimulatory element, either an RNA pseudoknot or a very stable RNA stem–loop. These two elements are separated by six to eight nucleotides, a distance that places the 5′ edge of the downstream stimulatory element in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit.

Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.","Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized.","['convincing_data supporting the_proofreading_hypothesis', 'biochemical_assays', 'studies', 'CoV_mutants', 'ExoN_functionality', ', the_features', 'ExoN', 'most_other_nidovirus_families']","['convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis', 'biochemical assays', 'studies', 'CoV mutants', 'ExoN functionality', ', the features', 'ExoN', 'most other nidovirus families']",convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis,biochemical assays,studies,CoV mutants,ExoN functionality,", the features",ExoN,most other nidovirus families,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.","Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.","['Our_results', 'MERS-CoV', 'the_ability', 'bats', 'clinical_signs', 'disease', 'the_general_hypothesis', 'bats', 'ancestral_reservoirs', 'MERS', 'CoV.']","['Our results', 'MERS-CoV', 'the ability', 'bats', 'clinical signs', 'disease', 'the general hypothesis', 'bats', 'ancestral reservoirs', 'MERS', 'CoV.']",Our results,MERS-CoV,the ability,bats,clinical signs,disease,the general hypothesis,bats,ancestral reservoirs,MERS,CoV.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some humans and experimental animals develop both humoral and cell-mediated cardiac-specific autoimmunity during infection. Benznidazole, a trypanocidal drug, is effective at reducing parasite load and decreasing the severity of myocarditis in acutely infected patients. We hypothesized that the magnitude of autoimmunity that develops following T. cruzi infection is directly proportional to the amount of damage caused by the parasite. To test this hypothesis, we used benznidazole to reduce the number of parasites in an experimental model of CHD and determined whether this treatment altered the autoimmune response. Infection of A/J mice with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi leads to the development of severe inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, and parasitosis in the heart accompanied by vigorous cardiac myosin-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and antibody production at 21 days postinfection. Mice succumbed to infection within a month if left untreated. Treatment of infected mice with benznidazole eliminated mortality and decreased disease severity. Treatment also reduced cardiac myosin-specific DTH and antibody production. Reinfection of treated mice with a heart-derived, virulent strain of T. cruzi or immunization with myosin led to the redevelopment of myosin-specific autoimmune responses and inflammation. These results provide a direct link between the levels of T. cruzi and the presence of autoimmunity and suggest that elimination of the parasite may result in the reduction or elimination of autoimmunity in the chronic phase of infection.",We hypothesized that the magnitude of autoimmunity that develops following T. cruzi infection is directly proportional to the amount of damage caused by the parasite.,"['the_magnitude', 'autoimmunity', 'T._cruzi_infection', 'the_amount', 'damage', 'the_parasite']","['the magnitude', 'autoimmunity', 'T. cruzi infection', 'the amount', 'damage', 'the parasite']",the magnitude,autoimmunity,T. cruzi infection,the amount,damage,the parasite,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.","Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly.","['virions', 'primarily K48-linked_polyubiquitin', 'core_proteins']","['virions', 'primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin', 'core proteins']",virions,primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin,core proteins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To test our hypothesis that themes of polio-related tweets and media articles would differ by location of interest (hashtag of country name mentioned in the tweet; country name mentioned in media articles) but would be similar to each other (tweets and media articles) for each location of interest. METHODS: We retrospectively examined a 40% random sample of Twitter data containing the hashtag #polio from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015 (N = 79,333), from which we extracted 5 subcorpora each with a co-occurring hashtag #India (n = 5027), #Iraq (n = 1238), #Nigeria (n = 1364), #Pakistan (n = 11,427), and #Syria (n = 2952). We also retrieved and categorized 73 polio-related English-language news stories from within the same timeframe. We assessed the association between polio-related English news themes and the Twitter content. Descriptive analyses and unsupervised machine learning (latent Dirichlet allocation modeling) were conducted on the 5 Twitter subcorpora. RESULTS: The results of the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling on the specific subcorpora with country co-occurring hashtags showed significant differences between the 5 countries in terms of content. English mass media content focused largely on violence/conflicts and cases of polio, whereas social media focused on eradication and vaccination efforts along with celebrations. DISCUSSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, our evidence suggests Twitter content differs significantly from English mass media content.

It was comprised of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. It was hydrophobic and had a net charge of +8 at neutral pH. Analysis of its secondary structure could not establish a simple transmembrane arrangement of the amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences. Furthermore, a very conserved structure of M appeared on comparison with the Dayoff optimal alignment of MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGEV, IBV Beaudette and IBV 6/82M amino acid sequences. As the two strains of BECV, F15 and Mebus present some antigenic differences, this led us to reconsider the role of M in viral antigen specificity.

Surprisingly, low-producing MBL genetic variants that may predispose children and immunocompromised individuals to infectious diseases are more common than would be expected in human populations. Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances. Consequently, the low and intermediate MBL levels commonly found in human populations might be the result of balancing selection. Using model infection systems with pseudotyped and authentic glycosylated viruses, we demonstrated that MBL indeed enhances infection of Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and West Nile viruses in low complement conditions. Mechanistic studies with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses confirmed that MBL binds to N-linked glycan epitopes on viral surfaces in a specific manner via the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain, which is necessary for enhanced infection. MBL mediates lipid-raft-dependent macropinocytosis of EBOV via a pathway that appears to require less actin or early endosomal processing compared with the filovirus canonical endocytic pathway. Using a validated RNA interference screen, we identified C1QBP (gC1qR) as a candidate surface receptor that mediates MBL-dependent enhancement of EBOV infection. We also identified dectin-2 (CLEC6A) as a potentially novel candidate attachment factor for EBOV. Our findings support the concept of an innate immune haplotype that represents critical interactions between MBL and complement component C4 genes and that may modify susceptibility or resistance to certain glycosylated pathogens. Therefore, higher levels of native or exogenous MBL could be deleterious in the setting of relative hypocomplementemia which can occur genetically or because of immunodepletion during active infections. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that the pressure of infectious diseases may have contributed in part to evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes.","Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances.","['certain_immune_defense_molecules', 'immunoglobulins', 'invasive_pathogens', 'MBL', 'infections', 'some_circumstances']","['certain immune defense molecules', 'immunoglobulins', 'invasive pathogens', 'MBL', 'infections', 'some circumstances']",certain immune defense molecules,immunoglobulins,invasive pathogens,MBL,infections,some circumstances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current infection control guidelines aim to prevent transmission via contact and respiratory droplet routes and do not consider the possibility of airborne transmission. It was hypothesised that subjects with CF produce viable respirable bacterial aerosols with coughing. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken of 15 children and 13 adults with CF, 26 chronically infected with P aeruginosa. A cough aerosol sampling system enabled fractioning of respiratory particles of different sizes and culture of viable Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria. Cough aerosols were collected during 5 min of voluntary coughing and during a sputum induction procedure when tolerated. Standardised quantitative culture and genotyping techniques were used. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was isolated in cough aerosols of 25 subjects (89%), 22 of whom produced sputum samples. P aeruginosa from sputum and paired cough aerosols were indistinguishable by molecular typing. In four cases the same genotype was isolated from ambient room air. Approximately 70% of viable aerosols collected during voluntary coughing were of particles ⩽3.3 μm aerodynamic diameter. P aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans were cultivated from respiratory particles in this size range. Positive room air samples were associated with high total counts in cough aerosols (p = 0.003).

Pigs infected with TGEV often suffer secondary infection by other pathogens, which aggravates the severity of diarrhea, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that persistent TGEV infection stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can more easily adhere to generating cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary targets of TGEV and ETEC infections. We found that TGEV can persistently infect porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and cause EMT, consistent with multiple changes in key cell characteristics. Infected cells display fibroblast-like shapes; exhibit increases in levels of mesenchymal markers with a corresponding loss of epithelial markers; have enhanced expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNAs; and demonstrate increases in migratory and invasive behaviors. Additional experiments showed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via TGF-β is critical for the TGEV-mediated EMT process. Cellular uptake is also modified in cells that have undergone EMT. TGEV-infected cells have higher levels of integrin α5 and fibronectin and exhibit enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces ETEC K88 adhesion and inhibits the expression of integrin α5 and fibronectin. Overall, these results suggest that TGEV infection induces EMT in IPEC-J2 cells, increasing the adhesion of ETEC K88 in the intestine and facilitating dual infection. IMPORTANCE Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea and is often followed by secondary infection by other pathogens. In this study, we showed that persistent TGEV infection induces an EMT in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and enhances the adhesion of the secondary pathogen ETEC K88. Additional experiments suggest that integrin α5 and fibronectin play an important role in TGEV-enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces the expression of integrin α5 and fibronectin and also reduces ETEC K88 adhesion. We conclude that TGEV infection triggers EMT and facilitates dual infection.

Therefore, we hypothesised the ability of these viruses, as possible vaccine candidates, in conferring protection in specific pathogen free (SPF) Domestic Shorthair as well as in conventional purebred British Shorthair cats. In SPF cats, after two oronasal and two intramuscular vaccinations with two weeks intervals, both vaccine candidates provided 100% protection against lethal homologous challenge with the highly virulent FIPV DF-2 strain. In contrast, the conventional purebred British Shorthair cats did not develop protection when they were immunised with the same vaccination regimes. In these groups 100% of the PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i immunised animals developed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Prolonged survival was observed in 40% of the animals, while 60% showed fulminant disease course. Genetic and more probably immunological differences between the SPF and non-SPF purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment.

From biochemical and morphological lines of evidence, we have proposed that Sec12p is localized to the ER by two mechanisms: static retention in the ER and dynamic retrieval from the early Golgi compartment. We have also shown that Rer1p, a membrane protein in the Golgi, is required for correct localization of Sec12p. In the present study, we have performed a systematic analysis to determine the ER localization signals in Sec12p corresponding to these two mechanisms. Both the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Sec12p show the ability to localize the protein to the ER. The effect of the TMD is potent and sufficient by itself for the ER localization and is strongly dependent on Rer1p. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain shows a moderate ER-localization capability which is independent of Rer1p. The rate of mannosyl modification has been measured to distinguish between retention and retrieval. The cytoplasmic domain significantly delays the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the TMD shows only a subtle retardation in the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi but strictly prevents the transport beyond there. From these observations, we conclude that the TMD mainly acts as the retrieval signal and the cytoplasmic domain contains the retention signal.

Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease. METHODS: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded. Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry. The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice. RESULTS: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality. These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P < 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05) into the CNS. Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P < 0.05). Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α or cytolytic activity. FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis.

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIV–SIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained. This survey also provided clues that silent codon changes, in particular from G-to-A, determine the subtype-specific sequence signatures.","Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated.","['Several_hypotheses', 'the_A-count', 'HIV-1']","['Several hypotheses', 'the A-count', 'HIV-1']",Several hypotheses,the A-count,HIV-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 4-year-old, female Asian palm civet was found dead by the owner. At necropsy, large amount of adipose tissue was found in the subcutis and in the peritoneal cavity. Most of the pancreas appeared red, translucent. Hepatomegaly, discoloration of the liver were evident, with multifocal areas of degeneration, characterized by white nodular lesions. Histologically, the pancreas showed severe interstitial and perilobular necrosis and extensive haemorrhages, with separation of the interstitium, mild reactive inflammation at the periphery of the pancreatic lobules. Liver showed multifocal foci of vacuolar degeneration, lipidic accumulation, sometimes associated to hepatocyte necrosis. A diagnosis of acute severe hemorrhagic-necrotizing pancreatitis (or acute pancreatic necrosis) associated with pancreatic and hepatic lipidosis was made. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first case report of acute lethal pancreatitis in an Asian palm civet.

It has been hypothesized that some features of their innate immune system may enable bats to trigger an efficient early immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a first line defense within the innate immune system and lie directly at the host–pathogen interface in targeting specific microbe-molecular patterns. However, the direction and strength of selection acting on TLRs are largely unknown for bats. Here, we studied the selection on viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 based on sequence data of 21 bat species. The major part (63 %) of the TLR8 gene evolved under purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. We also found evidence for persistent positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites (7 %), especially when compared to viral TLR evolution of other mammals. All of these putatively positively selected codons were located in the ligand-binding ectodomain, some coincidenced or were in close proximity to functional sites, as suggested by the crystallographic structure of the human TLR8. This might contribute to the inter-species variation in the ability to recognize molecular patterns of viruses. TLR8 evolution within bats revealed that branches leading to ancestral and recent lineages evolved under episodic positive selection, indicating selective selection pressures in restricted bat lineages. Altogether, we found that the TLR8 displays extensive sequence variation within bats and that unique features separate them from humans and other mammals.

It has been proposed that peptides having propensity to interact with membrane interfaces might exert broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses. To test this hypothesis, in this contribution we have analyzed the antiviral effects of peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region and the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41, which display different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity. Our data support the virucidal activity of a region that combines hydrophobic-at-interface membrane-proximal external region aromatics with hydrophobic residues of the transmembrane domain, and contains the absolutely conserved (679)LWYIK/R(683) sequence, proposed to embody a “cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus” motif. We further sought to correlate the antiviral activity of these peptides and their effects on membranes that mimic lipid composition and biophysical properties of the viral envelope. The data revealed that peptides endowed with virucidal activity were membrane active and induced permeabilization and fusion of virus-like lipid vesicles. In addition, they modulated lipid packing and miscibility of laterally segregated liquid domains, two properties that depend on the high cholesterol content of the viral membrane. Thus, the overall experimental evidence is consistent with a pattern of HIV inhibition that involves direct alteration of the physical chemistry of the virus membrane. Furthermore, the sequence-dependent effects observed might guide the development of new virucidal peptides.","To test this hypothesis, in this contribution we have analyzed the antiviral effects of peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region and the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41, which display different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity.","['this_contribution', 'the_antiviral_effects', 'peptides', 'the_membrane-proximal_external_region', 'the_transmembrane_domain', 'the_envelope_glycoprotein_subunit_gp41', 'different_degrees', 'interfacial_hydrophobicity']","['this contribution', 'the antiviral effects', 'peptides', 'the membrane-proximal external region', 'the transmembrane domain', 'the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41', 'different degrees', 'interfacial hydrophobicity']",this contribution,the antiviral effects,peptides,the membrane-proximal external region,the transmembrane domain,the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41,different degrees,interfacial hydrophobicity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Schematically, effector T cells specific for self-antigens exist normally, but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory T cells. As a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self-antigens, autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation. Conversely, by a procedure known as T-cell vaccination, autologous effector T cells re-injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression. Numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non-infected T4 cells. Such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin, the most likely, but not the only one, being the envelope protein gp120. Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases. Its purpose would be to prevent T-cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in HIV-seropositive patients. Apart from its potential therapeutic value, this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.","Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases.","['effector_T_cells', 'autoimmunopathic_activity', 'HIV-seropositive_patients', 'experimental_study', 'autoimmunity', 'human_autoimmune_diseases']","['effector T cells', 'autoimmunopathic activity', 'HIV-seropositive patients', 'experimental study', 'autoimmunity', 'human autoimmune diseases']",effector T cells,autoimmunopathic activity,HIV-seropositive patients,experimental study,autoimmunity,human autoimmune diseases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, increasing sectors of the population have expressed hesitancy about participating in such programs, leading to the re-emergence of vaccine preventable diseases. In this study we rely on a recreancy hypothesis to test the association between confidence in the government and local hospitals and the willingness to take the vaccine. Methods A secondary analysis of a survey that used a large sample of the U.S. population conducted in October 2009 was used (N = 968). Results The results indicate that 36.1% of the respondents expressed willingness to be vaccinated. Those with the greatest trust in the government were the most likely to be vaccinated (43.4%), and those least confident were the least willing (15.8%). From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures. The results indicate that public compliance with vaccination plans in health crisis requires the development of social and institutional trust.",In this study we rely on a recreancy hypothesis to test the association between confidence in the government and local hospitals and the willingness to take the vaccine.,"['this_study', 'a_recreancy_hypothesis', 'the_association', 'confidence', 'the_government_and_local_hospitals', 'the_willingness', 'the_vaccine']","['this study', 'a recreancy hypothesis', 'the association', 'confidence', 'the government and local hospitals', 'the willingness', 'the vaccine']",this study,a recreancy hypothesis,the association,confidence,the government and local hospitals,the willingness,the vaccine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) grown in Sac(-) cells, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) grown in CrFK cells, all budded exclusively into smooth-walled, tubulovesicular membranes located intermediately between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, identical to the so-called budding compartment previously identified for MHV. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of the infected cells showed that all four M proteins accumulated in a perinuclear region. Immunogold microscopy localized MHV M and IBV M in the budding compartment; in addition, a dense labeling in the Golgi complex occurred, MHV M predominantly in trans-Golgi cisternae and trans-Golgi reticulum and IBV M mainly in the cis and medial Golgi cisternae. The corresponding M proteins of the four viruses, when independently expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus system, also accumulated in the perinuclear area. Quantitative pulse-chase analysis of metabolically labeled cells showed that in each case the majority of the M glycoproteins carried oligosaccharide side chains with Golgi-specific modifications within 4 h after synthesis. Immunoelectron microscopy localized recombinant MHV M and IBV M to the same membranes as the respective proteins in coronavirus-infected cells, with the same cis-trans distribution over the Golgi complex.

Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets—the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli—speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1(HXB2) replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1(NL4-3) containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1(NL4-3) Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1(NL4-3). HIV-1(NL4-3) variants were capable of CD4(+) host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1(NL4-3), but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle.

The zoonotic Hendra virus (HeV), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, utilizes the attachment protein (G) and the fusion protein (F) to perform these critical functions. Upon triggering, the trimeric F protein undergoes a large, irreversible conformation change to drive membrane fusion. Previously, we have shown that the transmembrane (TM) domain of the F protein, separate from the rest of the protein, is present in a monomer-trimer equilibrium. This TM-TM association contributes to the stability of the prefusion form of the protein, supporting a role for TM-TM interactions in the control of F protein conformational changes. To determine the impact of disrupting TM-TM interactions, constructs expressing the HeV F TM with limited flanking sequences were synthesized. Coexpression of these constructs with HeV F resulted in dramatic reductions in the stability of F protein expression and fusion activity. In contrast, no effects were observed when the HeV F TM constructs were coexpressed with the nonhomologous parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) fusion protein, indicating a requirement for specific interactions. To further examine this, a TM peptide homologous to the PIV5 F TM domain was synthesized. Addition of the peptide prior to infection inhibited infection with PIV5 but did not significantly affect infection with human metapneumovirus, a related virus. These results indicate that targeted disruption of TM-TM interactions significantly impact viral fusion protein stability and function, presenting these interactions as a novel target for antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses require virus-cell membrane fusion to release the viral genome and replicate. The viral fusion protein triggers from the pre- to the postfusion conformation, an essentially irreversible change, to drive membrane fusion. We found that small proteins containing the TM and a limited flanking region homologous to the fusion protein of the zoonotic Hendra virus reduced protein expression and fusion activity. The introduction of exogenous TM peptides may displace a TM domain, disrupting native TM-TM interactions and globally destabilizing the fusion protein. Supporting this hypothesis, we showed that a sequence-specific transmembrane peptide dramatically reduced viral infection in another enveloped virus model, suggesting a broader inhibitory mechanism. Viral fusion protein TM-TM interactions are important for protein function, and disruption of these interactions dramatically reduces protein stability.","Supporting this hypothesis, we showed that a sequence-specific transmembrane peptide dramatically reduced viral infection in another enveloped virus model, suggesting a broader inhibitory mechanism.","['that a_sequence-specific_transmembrane_peptide dramatically reduced viral_infection', 'another_enveloped_virus_model', 'a_broader_inhibitory_mechanism']","['that a sequence-specific transmembrane peptide dramatically reduced viral infection', 'another enveloped virus model', 'a broader inhibitory mechanism']",that a sequence-specific transmembrane peptide dramatically reduced viral infection,another enveloped virus model,a broader inhibitory mechanism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFNα/β production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFNα/β production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFNα/β production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFNα than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88-independent stimulus, consistent with CD200's known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells.

Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth.

Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8–9 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition.

MHV-A59 virions use as a receptor a 110- to 120-kDa glycoprotein (MHVR) in the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of glycoproteins (G. S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K.

The role of virus-receptor interactions in determining the species specificity of MHV-A59 was examined by comparing the binding of virus and antireceptor antibodies to cell lines and intestinal brush border membranes (BBM) from many species. Polyclonal antireceptor antiserum (anti-MHVR) raised by immunization of SJL/J mice with BALB/c BBM recognized MHVR specifically in immunoblots of BALB/c BBM but not in BBM from adult SJL/J mice that are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, indicating a major difference in epitopes between MHVR and its SJL/J homolog which does not bind MHV (7). Anti-MHVR bound to plasma membranes of MHV-susceptible murine cell lines but not to membranes of human, cat, dog, monkey, or hamster cell lines. Cell lines from these species were resistant to MHV-A59 infection, and only the murine cell lines tested were susceptible. Pretreatment of murine fibroblasts with anti-MHVR prevented binding of radiolabeled virions to murine cells and prevented virus infection. Solid-phase virus-binding assays and virus overlay protein blot assays showed that MHV-A59 virions bound to MHVR on intestinal BBM from MHV-susceptible mouse strains but not to proteins on intestinal BBM from humans, cats, dogs, pigs, cows, rabbits, rats, cotton rats, or chickens. In immunoblots of BBM from these species, both polyclonal and monoclonal antireceptor antibodies that block MHV-A59 infection of murine cells recognized only the murine CEA-related glycoprotein and not homologous CEA-related glycoproteins of other species. These results suggest that MHV-A59 binds to a mouse-specific epitope of MHVR, and they support the hypothesis that the species specificity of MHV-A59 infection may be due to the specificity of the virus-receptor interaction.","These results suggest that MHV-A59 binds to a mouse-specific epitope of MHVR, and they support the hypothesis that the species specificity of MHV-A59 infection may be due to the specificity of the virus-receptor interaction.","['These_results', 'MHV', 'A59', 'binds', 'a_mouse-specific_epitope', 'MHVR', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_species_specificity', 'the_virus-receptor_interaction']","['These results', 'MHV', 'A59', 'binds', 'a mouse-specific epitope', 'MHVR', 'the hypothesis', 'the species specificity', 'the virus-receptor interaction']",These results,MHV,A59,binds,a mouse-specific epitope,MHVR,the hypothesis,the species specificity,the virus-receptor interaction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of lines of evidence suggest that this interaction induces exaggerated inflammatory, cytokine and tissue remodeling responses. We hypothesized that the 2′-5′OAS/RNase L system, an innate immune antiviral pathway, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these exaggerated responses. To test this hypothesis we characterize the activation of 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) in lungs from mice exposed to CS and viral PAMPs/live virus, alone and in combination. We also evaluated the inflammatory and remodeling responses induced by CS and virus/viral PAMPs in lungs from RNase L null and wild type mice.

Dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV is consistently to have more severe clinical presentations and pulmonary lesions than infection with PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. However, it is not known if dual infections with PCV2 and PRRSV in different infection order may lead to different clinical symptoms in the host. To mimic the possible field conditions, swine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV in vitro simultaneously or with one virus 18 h earlier than the other. The cell viability, cytopathic effects, antigen-containing rates, phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities, cytokine profiles (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-α) and FasL transcripts were determined, analyzed, and compared to prove the hypothesis. RESULTS: A marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-α expression level was revealed in AMs inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously and in AMs inoculated with PCV2 first then PRRSV 18 h later, but not in AMs inoculated with PRRSV first then PCV2 18 h later. Transient decrease in phagocytosis but constant reduction in microbicidal capability in AMs in the group inoculated with PCV2 alone and constant decrease in phagocytosis and microbicidal capability in AMs in all PRRSV-inoculated groups were noted. The levels of IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-α, and FasL transcripts in AMs in all groups with dual inoculation of PCV2 and PRRSV were significantly increased regardless of the infection orders as compared with infection by PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. CONCLUSIONS: Swine AMs infected with PCV2 first then PRRSV later or infected with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously displayed marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-α expression level. The different inoculation orders of PCV2 and PRRSV in AMs leading to different results in viral antigen positivity, cytopathology, and cytokine profile may explain, at least partially, the underlying mechanism of the enhanced pulmonary lesions in PRDC exerted by dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV and the variable clinical manifestations of PRDC-affected pigs in the field.","The cell viability, cytopathic effects, antigen-containing rates, phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities, cytokine profiles (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-α) and FasL transcripts were determined, analyzed, and compared to prove the hypothesis.","['The_cell_viability', 'cytopathic_effects', 'antigen-containing_rates', 'phagocytotic_and_microbial_killing_capabilities', 'cytokine_profiles', '_', 'TNF-α', 'IFN-α', 'FasL_transcripts', 'the_hypothesis']","['The cell viability', 'cytopathic effects', 'antigen-containing rates', 'phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities', 'cytokine profiles', ' ', 'TNF-α', 'IFN-α', 'FasL transcripts', 'the hypothesis']",The cell viability,cytopathic effects,antigen-containing rates,phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities,cytokine profiles, ,TNF-α,IFN-α,FasL transcripts,the hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNK-phosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae induced the release of distinct CC and CXC, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines and growth factors by human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae time-dependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser(63/73)-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNFα. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release.

Because alpha herpesviruses spread along synaptic circuits, and infected neurons exhibit altered electrophysiology and increased spontaneous firing, we hypothesized that alpha herpesviruses use activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms for egress and spread from neurons. To address this hypothesis, we used a compartmentalized primary neuron culture system to measure egress and spread of pseudorabies virus (PRV), pharmacological and optogenetics approaches to modulate neuronal firing activity, and a live-cell fluorescence microscopy assay to directly visualize the exocytosis of individual virus particles from infected neurons. Using tetrodotoxin to silence neuronal activity, we observed no inhibition of virus spread, and using potassium chloride or optogenetics to elevate neuronal activity, we also show no increase in virus spread. Using a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to directly measure virus egress from infected neurons, we observed no association between virus particle exocytosis and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we observed virus particle exocytosis occurs in association with constitutive secretory Rab GTPases, Rab6a and Rab8a, not Rab proteins that are associated with the Ca2+-regulated secretory pathway in neurons, Rab3a and Rab11a. Therefore, we conclude that alpha herpesvirus egress and spread is independent of neuronal activity and Ca2+ signaling because virus particle exocytosis uses constitutive secretory mechanisms in neurons.Author SummaryAlpha herpesviruses, including important human pathogens Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2, and Varicella-Zoster Virus, are among the very few viruses that naturally infect the nervous system. These viruses cause recurrent herpetic and zosteriform lesions, peripheral neuropathies, and deadly or debilitating central nervous system diseases. Many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral egress and spread remain unknown, particularly in the context of specialized neuronal cell biology. Our results indicate that elevated firing activity of infected neurons is not functionally or mechanistically linked to virus egress and spread; therefore, therapies targeting peripheral neuropathic symptoms, elevated neuronal activity, and synaptic vesicle secretory mechanisms are unlikely to affect virus spread in the nervous system.","Because alpha herpesviruses spread along synaptic circuits, and infected neurons exhibit altered electrophysiology and increased spontaneous firing, we hypothesized that alpha herpesviruses use activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms for egress and spread from neurons.","['alpha', 'synaptic_circuits', 'infected_neurons_exhibit', 'electrophysiology', 'spontaneous_firing', 'alpha', 'activity-dependent_synaptic_vesicle-like_regulated_secretory_mechanisms', 'egress', 'neurons']","['alpha', 'synaptic circuits', 'infected neurons exhibit', 'electrophysiology', 'spontaneous firing', 'alpha', 'activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms', 'egress', 'neurons']",alpha,synaptic circuits,infected neurons exhibit,electrophysiology,spontaneous firing,alpha,activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms,egress,neurons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTIs currently relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT). It is conceivable, however, that these diagnostic methods also yield positive results if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT. Positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. The existence of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has not been established. We hypothesized that asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated by current diagnostic methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted at the Erasmus MC–Sophia Children's Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Asymptomatic children (n = 405) and children with RTI symptoms (n = 321) aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from July 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011. Clinical data, pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens, and serum samples were collected. The primary objective was to differentiate between colonization and symptomatic infection with M. pneumoniae by current diagnostic methods, especially real-time PCR. M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 21.2% (95% CI 17.2%–25.2%) of the asymptomatic children and in 16.2% (95% CI 12.2%–20.2%) of the symptomatic children (p = 0.11). Neither serology nor quantitative PCR nor culture differentiated asymptomatic carriage from infection. A total of 202 children were tested for the presence of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. Finally, longitudinal sampling showed persistence of M. pneumoniae in the URT for up to 4 mo. Fifteen of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae and 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae in this longitudinal follow-up tested negative after 1 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study has limitations, such as a single study site and limited sample size, our data indicate that the presence of M. pneumoniae in the URT is common in asymptomatic children. The current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection.

Recently, influenza virus-like sequences were identified in bats; however, the viruses could not be cultured. This discovery aroused great interest in understanding the evolutionary history and pandemic potential of bat-influenza. Using synthetic genomics, we were unable to rescue the wild type bat virus, but could rescue a modified bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1). This modified bat-influenza virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in mice, resulting in severe disease. Additional studies using a bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA of A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) showed that the PR8 HA and NA contributed to the pathogenicity in mice. Unlike other influenza viruses, engineering truncations hypothesized to reduce interferon antagonism into the NS1 protein didn't attenuate bat-influenza. In contrast, substitution of a putative virulence mutation from the bat-influenza PB2 significantly attenuated the virus in mice and introduction of a putative virulence mutation increased its pathogenicity. Mini-genome replication studies and virus reassortment experiments demonstrated that bat-influenza has very limited genetic and protein compatibility with Type A or Type B influenza viruses, yet it readily reassorts with another divergent bat-influenza virus, suggesting that the bat-influenza lineage may represent a new Genus/Species within the Orthomyxoviridae family. Collectively, our data indicate that the bat-influenza viruses recently identified are authentic viruses that pose little, if any, pandemic threat to humans; however, they provide new insights into the evolution and basic biology of influenza viruses.","Unlike other influenza viruses, engineering truncations hypothesized to reduce interferon antagonism into the NS1 protein","['other_influenza_viruses', 'engineering_truncations', 'interferon_antagonism', 'the_NS1_protein']","['other influenza viruses', 'engineering truncations', 'interferon antagonism', 'the NS1 protein']",other influenza viruses,engineering truncations,interferon antagonism,the NS1 protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess the effect of azithromycin on the duration of respiratory episodes in young children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, hypothesising that it reduces the duration of the symptomatic period. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children aged 1–3 years, who were diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort; a birth cohort consisting of the general Danish population of Zealand, including Copenhagen. Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of ≥50 breaths per min; fever of ≥39°C; C-reactive protein concentration of ≥476·20 nmol/L [≥50 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verified by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297. Findings Between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 asthma-like episodes in 72 children (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo). The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3·4 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7·7 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a significant shortening of the episode of 63·3% (95% CI 56·0–69·3; p<0·0001). The effect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0·0001). We noted no differences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in final analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0·30), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment. Interpretation Azithromycin reduced the duration of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting that this drug could have a role in acute management of exacerbations. Further research is needed to disentangle the inflammatory versus antimicrobial aspects of this relation.

Because a variety of bacteria, parasites, viruses, and toxins that associate with the endoplasmic reticulum enter host cells by a cholesterol-dependent route, we tested the hypothesis that autophagy is triggered when microbes engage components of lipid raft domains. As the intracellular respiratory pathogen L. pneumophila or the extracellular uropathogen FimH(+) Escherichia coli entered macrophages by a cholesterol-sensitive mechanism, they immediatezly resided in vacuoles rich in glycosylphosphatidylinositol moieties and the autophagy enzyme Atg7. As expected for autophagosomes, the vacuoles sequentially acquired the endoplasmic reticulum protein BiP, the autophagy markers Atg8 and monodansyl-cadaverine, and the lysosomal protein LAMP-1. A robust macrophage response to the pathogens was cholesterol-dependent, since fewer Atg7-rich vacuoles were observed when macrophages were pretreated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or filipin.

Recent studies suggest that toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and that the reason for corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory diseases is related to the anti-inflammatory activities of corticosteroids through the reduction of NF-κB. We hypothesized that the administration of TLR ligands in combination with corticosteroid causes ONFH and that transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH. The aim of the study was to evaluate (1) the incidence of ONFH in rats after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands together with methylprednisolone (MPSL) and (2) whether transcription factors contribute to the development of ONFH. Male Wistar rats (n=148) were divided into five groups as follows: Group 1: Saline+MPSL, Group 2: Imiquimod+Saline, Group 3: Imiquimod+MPSL, Group 4: CpG-C+MPSL, Group 5: Imiquimod+BAY11-7082+MPSL. As a result, ONFH was observed in 0 of 12 rats in Group 1, in 1 of 10 in Group 2, in 6 of 12 in Group 3, in 4 of 12 in Group 4, in 0 of 9 in Group 5. MPSL treatment did not significantly affect IRF7 activity, whereas NF-κB activity was significantly repressed in Group 2 and Group 3. Furthermore, the repression in interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activity by BAY11-7082 interfered with the development of ONFH simultaneously with the MPSL treatment-induced repression in NF-κB activity. In conclusion, in the present study, corticosteroid treatment after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands caused ONFH. Repression in NF-κB activity by corticosteroid treatment boosted the development of ONFH.","Recent studies suggest that toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and that the reason for corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory diseases is related to the anti-inflammatory activities of corticosteroids through the reduction of NF-κB.

It has also been shown that cluster (short-interval) DNA vaccination regimen generates potent immune responses in a minimal timeframe. Thus, in the current study we hypothesize that the cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination will generate significant antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell infiltrates in E7-expressing tumors in tumor-bearing mice, leading to an increase in apoptotic tumor cell death.

We also observed that cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination in the presence of tumor generates significantly higher E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses in the systemic circulation as well as in the tumors. In addition, this vaccination regimen also led to significantly lower levels of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells and myeloid suppressor cells compared to vaccination with CRT DNA in peripheral blood and in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in an increase in apoptotic tumor cell death.

This study tested the hypothesis that the infection causes negligible impact on pigs’ growth performance in terms of feed conversion efficiency, daily feed intake, daily growth, age on reaching 100 kg bodyweight and overall feed intake. A sample of 1955 pigs originating from 43 breeding herds was classified into five infection status groups; seronegative pigs (n = 887); seropositive pigs (n = 874); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 33 kg and 60 kg (n = 123); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 61 kg and 80 kg (n = 34) and pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 81 kg and 100 kg (n = 37). Each pig had daily recordings of feed intake and bodyweight from 33 kg to 100 kg. Marginal effects of the virus infection on the outcomes were estimated by multi-level linear regression, which accounted for known fixed effects (breed, birthdate, average daily feed intake and growth phase) and random effects (cluster effects of pig and herd). RESULTS: The seropositive and virus positive pigs had decreased (P value<0.05) growth performance compared to seronegative pigs even though feed intake was not decreased. Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirement and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg bodyweight. The effects were more marked (P value<0.03) in pigs infected at a younger age and lasted a longer period. Despite increased feed intake observed, their growth rates were lower and they took more time to reach 100 kg bodyweight compared to the seronegative pigs.

TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling.

The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood‐sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus.

Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes’ true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.","Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH).","['genomes', 'CUB', 'selection', 'translational_efficiency', 'accuracy', 'the_translational_efficiency_hypothesis', 'TEH']","['genomes', 'CUB', 'selection', 'translational efficiency', 'accuracy', 'the translational efficiency hypothesis', 'TEH']",genomes,CUB,selection,translational efficiency,accuracy,the translational efficiency hypothesis,TEH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we identified transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), whose expression does correlate with SARS-CoV infection in the upper lobe of the lung. In Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2, large syncytia were induced by SARS-CoV infection. Further, the lysosome-tropic reagents failed to inhibit, whereas the heptad repeat peptide efficiently inhibited viral entry into cells, suggesting that TMPRSS2 affects the S protein at the cell surface and induces virus-plasma membrane fusion. On the other hand, production of virus in TMPRSS2-expressing cells did not result in S-protein cleavage or increased infectivity of the resulting virus. Thus, TMPRSS2 affects the entry of virus but not other phases of virus replication. We hypothesized that the spatial orientation of TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein is a key mechanism underling this phenomenon. To test this, the TMPRSS2 and S proteins were expressed in cells labeled with fluorescent probes of different colors, and the cell-cell fusion between these cells was tested. Results indicate that TMPRSS2 needs to be expressed in the opposing (target) cell membrane to activate S protein rather than in the producer cell, as found for influenza A virus and metapneumoviruses. This is the first report of TMPRSS2 being required in the target cell for activation of a viral fusion protein but not for the S protein synthesized in and transported to the surface of cells. Our findings suggest that the TMPRSS2 expressed in lung tissues may be a determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity at the initial site of SARS-CoV infection.",We hypothesized that the spatial orientation of TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein is a key mechanism underling this phenomenon.,"['the_spatial_orientation', 'TMPRSS2_vis-a-vis_S_protein', 'a_key_mechanism', 'this_phenomenon']","['the spatial orientation', 'TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein', 'a key mechanism', 'this phenomenon']",the spatial orientation,TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein,a key mechanism,this phenomenon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution.

We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino- 1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms. Further, ceramide accumulation reveals this cycle by upsetting the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic and/ or disrupting retention by altering bilayer dynamics.",We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids.,"['the_Golgi_complex', 'part', 'specific_interactions', 'protein_transmembrane_domains', 'membrane_lipids']","['the Golgi complex', 'part', 'specific interactions', 'protein transmembrane domains', 'membrane lipids']",the Golgi complex,part,specific interactions,protein transmembrane domains,membrane lipids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood, and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the use of a rapid viral detection test for children with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Emergency Departments (EDs) changes patient management and resource use in the ED, compared to not using a rapid viral detection test. We hypothesized that rapid viral testing reduces antibiotic use in the ED as well as reduces the rate of ancillary testing and length of ED visits. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 1, 2014), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (15 July 2014), EMBASE.com (1988 to July 2014), HealthStar (1966 to 2009), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to July 2014), CAB Abstracts (1973 to July 2014), CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007) and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality, and extract data. We obtained missing data from trial authors. We expressed differences in rate of investigations and antibiotic use as risk ratios (RRs), and expressed difference in ED length of visits as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: No new trials were identified in this 2014 update. We included four trials (three RCTs and one quazi‐RCT), with 759 children in the rapid viral testing group and 829 in the control group. Three out of the four studies were comparable in terms of young age of participants, with one study increasing the age of inclusion up to five years of age. All studies included either fever or respiratory symptoms as inclusion criteria (two required both, one required fever or respiratory symptoms, and one required only fever). All studies were comparable in terms of exclusion criteria, intervention, and outcome data. In terms of risk of bias, one study failed to utilize a random sequence generator, one study did not comment on completeness of outcome data, and only one of four studies included allocation concealment as part of the study design. None of the studies definitively blinded participants. Rapid viral testing resulted in a trend toward decreased antibiotic use in the ED, but this was not statistically significant. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group, but no effect on length of ED visits, or blood or urine testing in the ED. No study made mention of any adverse effects related to viral testing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support routine rapid viral testing to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Rapid viral testing may or may not reduce rates of antibiotic use, and other investigations (urine and blood testing); these studies do not provide enough power to resolve this question. However, rapid viral testing does reduce the rate of chest X‐rays in the ED.

Natural selection has favored these viruses to be retained in the phloem to facilitate acquisition and transmission by aphids. We show that treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate with sodium sulfite reduces transmission of the purified virus by aphids. Transmission electron microscopy data indicated no gross change in virion morphology due to treatments. However, treated virions were not acquired by aphids through the hindgut epithelial cells and were not transmitted when injected directly into the hemocoel. Analysis of virus preparations using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed a number of host plant proteins co-purifying with viruses, some of which were lost following sodium sulfite treatment. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we show data suggesting that several of the virus-associated host plant proteins accumulated to higher levels in aphids that were fed on CYDV-infected plants compared to healthy plants. We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a) that sodium sulfite treatment disrupts critical virion-host protein interactions required for aphid transmission, or (b) that host infection with CYDV modulates phloem protein expression in a way that is favorable for virus uptake by aphids. Importantly, the genes coding for the plant proteins associated with virus may be examined as targets in breeding cereal crops for new modes of virus resistance that disrupt phloem-virus or aphid-virus interactions.","We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a)","['two_hypotheses', 'these_observations']","['two hypotheses', 'these observations']",two hypotheses,these observations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time. Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013-2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first. Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400-700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints. Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication.

However, subjective sensation of nasal patency may be more associated with activation of cold receptors by inspired air than with respiratory effort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether subjective nasal patency correlates with nasal mucosal temperature in healthy subjects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two healthy adults were recruited for this study. Subjects first completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and a unilateral visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify subjective nasal patency. A miniaturized thermocouple sensor was then used to record nasal mucosal temperature bilaterally in two locations along the nasal septum: at the vestibule and across from the inferior turbinate head. RESULTS: The range of temperature oscillations during the breathing cycle, defined as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory temperatures, was greater during deep breaths (ΔT(exp-insp) = 6.2 ± 2.6°C) than during resting breathing (ΔT(exp-insp) = 4.2 ± 2.3°C) in both locations (p < 10(−13)). Mucosal temperature measured at the right vestibule had a statistically significant correlation with both right-side VAS score (Pearson r = −0.55, p=0.0076) and NOSE score (Pearson r = −0.47, p=0.028). No other statistically significant correlations were found between mucosal temperature and subjective nasal patency scores. Nasal mucosal temperature was lower in the first cavity to be measured, which was the right cavity in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation. A possible correlation was found between subjective nasal patency scores and nasal mucosal temperature, but our results were inconsistent. The higher temperature in the left cavity suggests that the sensor irritated the nasal mucosa, affecting the correlation between patency scores and mucosal temperature. Future studies should consider non-contact temperature sensors to prevent mucosa irritation.","The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation.","['the_common_experience', 'airflow_sensation', 'deep_breaths', 'the_hypothesis', 'mucosal cooling', 'a_central_role']","['the common experience', 'airflow sensation', 'deep breaths', 'the hypothesis', 'mucosal cooling', 'a central role']",the common experience,airflow sensation,deep breaths,the hypothesis,mucosal cooling,a central role,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI− viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI− mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI−, but not with WT rSV5. Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system.

We hypothesized that while asymptomatic carriage would not increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and graft loss, severe infection would. METHODS: All lung transplant cases between January 2000 and July 2013 performed at our center were reviewed for respiratory viral samples. Each isolation of virus was classified according to clinical level of severity: asymptomatic, symptomatic without pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Multivariate Cox modeling was employed to assess the impact of CARV isolation on progression to CLAD and graft loss. RESULTS: 4408 specimens were collected from 563 total patients with 139 patients producing 324 virus positive specimens in 245 episodes of CARV infection. Overall, the risk of CLAD was elevated by viral infection (HR 1.64, p < 0.01). This risk, however, was due to viral pneumonia alone (HR 3.94, p < 0.01), without significant impact from symptomatic viral infection (HR 0.97, p = 0.94) nor from asymptomatic viral infection (HR 0.99, p = 0.98). The risk of graft loss was not increased by asymptomatic CARV infection (HR 0.74, p = 0.37) nor symptomatic CARV infection (HR 1.39, p = 0.41). Viral pneumonia did, however, significantly increase the risk of graft loss (HR 2.78, p < 0.01).

Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.","We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum.","['the_hypothesis', 'energy_metabolism', 'its_endocrine_regulation', 'the_first_10_d', 'life', 'calves', 'either_colostrum', 'a_milk-based_formula', 'a_similar_nutrient_composition', 'bioactive_substances']","['the hypothesis', 'energy metabolism', 'its endocrine regulation', 'the first 10 d', 'life', 'calves', 'either colostrum', 'a milk-based formula', 'a similar nutrient composition', 'bioactive substances']",the hypothesis,energy metabolism,its endocrine regulation,the first 10 d,life,calves,either colostrum,a milk-based formula,a similar nutrient composition,bioactive substances,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this including issues of genetics, physiology, nutrition and management, and these factors have been investigated at the animal, organ and cellular level at critical time points of the productive life of dairy cows. This paper reviews the physiological events and their causes and consequences affecting fertility in dairy cows and summarises these in a downloadable poster. We consider the following points to have the greatest negative impact on fertility and that they need to be prioritised in efforts to ameliorate the problem (others have been included in the review). Firstly, minimise negative energy balance and resolve any infection of the post partum uterus. Secondly, expression and detection of oestrus followed by insemination with high quality semen (day 0). Thirdly, ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Fourthly, an early increase in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum (days 3–7).

A 33.5 kilobase (kb) nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is in the 100–300 kb range. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps towards DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of the size constraints on RNP entities and the role of genome size in virus adaptation. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20–34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with the acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) encoded in the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in a monophyletic subset of nidoviruses. However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region including unannotated domains, and overall 41.1-kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, as well as key replicative domains. These domains may include functionally relevant substitutions rarely or never before observed in highly conserved sites of RdRp, NiRAN, ExoN and 3CLpro. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts, e.g. Ankyrin and Fibronectin type II, which might modulate virus-host interactions. PSCNV's greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features–impressive in themselves–attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.","However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes.","['However , apparent_constraints', 'the_size', 'ORF1b', 'other_key_replicative_enzymes', 'further_expansion', 'these_viral_RNA_genomes']","['However , apparent constraints', 'the size', 'ORF1b', 'other key replicative enzymes', 'further expansion', 'these viral RNA genomes']","However , apparent constraints",the size,ORF1b,other key replicative enzymes,further expansion,these viral RNA genomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcomes of FeLV infection in domestic cats vary according to host susceptibility, virus strain, and infectious challenge dose. Jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi) are small wild felids from South and Central America. We previously reported on FeLV infections in jaguarundis. We hypothesized here that the outcomes of FeLV infection in P. yagouaroundi mimic those observed in domestic cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the population of jaguarundis at Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo for natural FeLV infection and resulting outcomes. METHODS: We investigated the jaguarundis using serological and molecular methods and monitored them for FeLV-related diseases for 5 years. We retrieved relevant biological and clinical information for the entire population of 23 jaguarundis held at zoo. Post-mortem findings from necropsies were recorded and histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed for FeLV-positive samples. For sample prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare frequencies between infected and uninfected animals. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: In total, we detected evidence of FeLV exposure in four out of 23 animals (17%; 95% CI 5–39%). No endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) sequences were detected. An intestinal B-cell lymphoma in one jaguarundi was not associated with FeLV. Two jaguarundis presented FeLV test results consistent with an abortive FeLV infection with seroconversion, and two other jaguarundis had results consistent with a progressive infection and potentially FeLV-associated clinical disorders and post-mortem changes. Phylogenetic analysis of env revealed the presence of FeLV-A, a common origin of the virus in both animals (100% identity) and the closest similarity to FeLV-FAIDS and FeLV-3281 (98.4% identity), originally isolated from cats in the USA.

EV-D68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen; however, due to lack of a permissive animal model for EV-D68, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against EV-D68 has been hampered. Recently, it was shown that EV-D68 has a strong affinity for α2,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) and we have shown previously that α2,6-linked SAs are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection. Here, we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated EV-D68 strains (VANBT/1 and MO/14/49), along with the historical prototype Fermon strain (ATCC), to infect cotton rats. We found that cotton rats are permissive to EV-D68 infection without virus adaptation. The different strains of EV-D68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody (NA) upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization. Infection with the VANBT/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology. Intramuscular immunization with live VANBT/1 or MO/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses, but a moderate heterologous NA response. We showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of NA against VANBT/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy. VANBT/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from VANBT/1 challenge, but induced strong pulmonary Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology, indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization. In conclusion, our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis, immune response, anti-viral therapies and vaccines against EV-D68 infection.","Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection.","['cotton', 'rats', 'a_potential_model', 'EV-D68_infection']","['cotton', 'rats', 'a potential model', 'EV-D68 infection']",cotton,rats,a potential model,EV-D68 infection,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. RESULTS: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.","Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.","['Structural_similarities', 'ascovirus_and_ichnovirus_particles', 'the_biology', 'their_transmission', 'ichnoviruses', 'ascoviruses', 'molecular_evidence', 'this_hypothesis']","['Structural similarities', 'ascovirus and ichnovirus particles', 'the biology', 'their transmission', 'ichnoviruses', 'ascoviruses', 'molecular evidence', 'this hypothesis']",Structural similarities,ascovirus and ichnovirus particles,the biology,their transmission,ichnoviruses,ascoviruses,molecular evidence,this hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, P<0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls.

A number of neurotropic viruses have been found to invade the brain through the OB. There is growing evidence that microscopic particles of toxic dusts can propagate from the nasal epithelium to the OB and further into the brain. These harmful agents impair cellular elements of the brain. Apparently, cells in the OB are the most affected, as they are the first to encounter viral infections and toxic particles. It is well known that neuronal and glial progenitors are continuously generated from neuronal stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult brain and then migrate predominantly into the OB. Therefore, it is feasible to suggest that substitution of injured or dead cells in the OB by new-born neurons, differentiating from progenitors, plays a role in protecting the OB neuronal microcircuits from destruction. Furthermore, some cytokines and chemokines released in response to infection and/or intoxication can modulate different stages of neurogenesis (proliferation, migration, and differentiation). We hypothesize that continuous neurogenesis in the olfactory system throughout adulthood evolved as a protective mechanism to prevent impairment of the most ancient but vitally important sensory system. In addition, differentiation of a substantial portion of progenitors to glial cells, including macrophages and microglia, may create an additional barrier to exogenous agents on their way deep to the brain.",We hypothesize that continuous neurogenesis in the olfactory system throughout adulthood evolved as a protective mechanism to prevent impairment of the most ancient but vitally important sensory system.,"['continuous_neurogenesis', 'the_olfactory_system', 'adulthood', 'a_protective_mechanism', 'impairment', 'the_most_ancient_but_vitally_important_sensory_system']","['continuous neurogenesis', 'the olfactory system', 'adulthood', 'a protective mechanism', 'impairment', 'the most ancient but vitally important sensory system']",continuous neurogenesis,the olfactory system,adulthood,a protective mechanism,impairment,the most ancient but vitally important sensory system,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. ISG15 can be covalently attached to proteins, analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors. Specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their C-termini and substrate proteins. The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15. RESULTS: We have cloned and expressed 22 human DUBs, representing the major clades of the USP protease family. Utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and ISG15, we have identified USP2, USP5 (IsoT1), USP13 (IsoT3), and USP14 as ISG15-reactive proteases, in addition to the bona fide ISG15-specific protease USP18 (UBP43). USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB, and its ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: By evolutionary standards, ISG15 is a newcomer among the UbLs and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin. Functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice.","The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15.","['The_tail_regions', 'ubiquitin', 'ISG15', 'promiscuous_deubiquitinating_proteases', '( DUBs', 'both_ubiquitin', 'ISG15']","['The tail regions', 'ubiquitin', 'ISG15', 'promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases', '( DUBs', 'both ubiquitin', 'ISG15']",The tail regions,ubiquitin,ISG15,promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases,( DUBs,both ubiquitin,ISG15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are interested in testing the hypothesis that programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting can be used to control cellular gene expression. Toward this end, a computer program was designed to search large DNA databases for consensus −1 ribosomal frameshift signals. The results demonstrated that consensus programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals can be identified in a substantial number of chromosomally encoded mRNAs and that they occur with frequencies from two- to sixfold greater than random in all of the databases searched. A preliminary survey of the databases resulting from the computer searches found that consensus frameshift signals are present in at least 21 homologous genes from different species, 2 of which are nearly identical, suggesting evolutionary conservation of function. We show that four previously described missense alleles of genes that are linked to human diseases would disrupt putative programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals, suggesting that the frameshift signal may be involved in the normal expression of these genes. We also demonstrate that signals found in the yeast RAS1 and the human CCR5 genes were able to promote significant levels of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting.

It contains a highly conserved hydrophobic region (amino acids 524 to 539) located 24 amino acids downstream of the N terminus of the Ebola virus GP2 subunit. Comparison of this region with the structural features of the transmembrane subunit of avian retroviral GPs suggests that the conserved Ebola virus hydrophobic region may, in fact, serve as the fusion peptide. To test this hypothesis directly, we introduced conservative (alanine) and nonconservative (arginine) amino acid substitutions at eight positions in this region of the GP2 molecule. The effects of these mutations were deduced from the ability of the Ebola virus GP to complement the infectivity of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking the receptor-binding G protein. Some mutations, such as Ile-to-Arg substitutions at positions 532 (I532R), F535R, G536A, and P537R, almost completely abolished the ability of the GP to support VSV infectivity without affecting the transport of GP to the cell surface and its incorporation into virions or the production of virus particles. Other mutations, such as G528R, L529A, L529R, I532A, and F535A, reduced the infectivity of the VSV-Ebola virus pseudotypes by at least one-half. These findings, together with previous reports of liposome association with a peptide corresponding to positions 524 to 539 in the GP molecule, offer compelling support for a fusion peptide role for the conserved hydrophobic region in the Ebola virus GP.","To test this hypothesis directly, we introduced conservative (alanine) and nonconservative (arginine) amino acid substitutions at eight positions in this region of the GP2 molecule.","['conservative_(alanine', 'nonconservative_(arginine)_amino_acid_substitutions', 'eight_positions', 'this_region', 'the_GP2_molecule']","['conservative (alanine', 'nonconservative (arginine) amino acid substitutions', 'eight positions', 'this region', 'the GP2 molecule']",conservative (alanine,nonconservative (arginine) amino acid substitutions,eight positions,this region,the GP2 molecule,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process begins when the bacteria aggregate in mucus secretions outside the light organ. The cells eventually leave the aggregate, enter the light organ, and encounter a rich supply of peptides. The need to dissociate from mucus and presumably utilize peptides led us to hypothesize that protease activity is integral to the colonization process. Protease activity associated with whole cells of Vibrio fischeri strain ES114 was identified as the product of a putative cell membrane-associated aminopeptidase (PepN). To characterize this activity, the aminopeptidase was cloned, overexpressed, and purified. Initial steady-state kinetic studies revealed that the aminopeptidase has broad activity, with a preference for basic and hydrophobic side chains and k(cat) and K(m) values that are lower and smaller, respectively, than those of Escherichia coli PepN. A V. fischeri mutant unable to produce PepN is significantly delayed in its ability to colonize squid within the first 12 h, but eventually it establishes a wild-type colonization level. Likewise, in competition with the wild type for colonization, the mutant is outcompeted at 12 h postinoculation but then competes evenly by 24 h. Also, the PepN-deficient strain fails to achieve wild-type levels of cells in aggregates, suggesting an explanation for the initial colonization delay.

The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent downstream open reading frames encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and downstream open reading frames affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the −1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by >4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a “golden mean” model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins.","Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the −1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins.","['three_different_strategies', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_−1_PRF_signals', 'coronaviruses', 'the_correct_ratios', 'downstream-encoded_proteins']","['three different strategies', 'the hypothesis', 'the −1 PRF signals', 'coronaviruses', 'the correct ratios', 'downstream-encoded proteins']",three different strategies,the hypothesis,the −1 PRF signals,coronaviruses,the correct ratios,downstream-encoded proteins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year.

High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the prototypical inflammatory disease of the CNS and is characterized by widely distributed inflammatory demyelinating plaques that can involve the brain, spinal cord and/or optic nerves. Optic neuritis (ON), inflammatory injury of the optic nerve that frequently occurs in patients with MS, has been the focus of intense study in part given the readily accessible nature of clinical outcome measures. Exploring the clinical and pathological features of ON in relation to other inflammatory demyelinating conditions of the CNS, namely MS and neuromyelitis optica, provides an opportunity to glean common and distinct mechanisms of disease. Emerging data from clinical studies along with various animal models involving ON implicate innate and adaptive immune responses directed at glial targets, including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and aquaporin 4. Resolution of inflammation in ON is commonly observed both clinically and experimentally, but persistent nerve injury is also one emerging hallmark of ON. One hypothesis seeking evaluation is that, in comparison to other sites targeted in MS, the optic nerve is a highly specialized target within the CNS predisposing to unique immunologic processes that generate ON.

Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear. It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and into the CNS. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.","Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS.","['VNAs', 'the_CNS', 'B_cells', 'the_periphery', 'the_CNS', 'RABV', 'the_CNS']","['VNAs', 'the CNS', 'B cells', 'the periphery', 'the CNS', 'RABV', 'the CNS']",VNAs,the CNS,B cells,the periphery,the CNS,RABV,the CNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus) of different neurovirulences with primary cell cultures of brain immune cells (astrocytes and microglia) and mouse tissues. We found that the level of neurovirulence of the virus correlates with its differential ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 12 [IL-12] p40, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-1β) in astrocytes and microglia and in mouse brains and spinal cords.

Furthermore, the proportion of MHC-heterozygous embryos varied over time, suggesting that non-random fertilization was dependent on an external factor that changed over time. As a higher frequency of heterozygous individuals correlated with an uncontrolled epidemic by MHV (mouse hepatitis virus), we suggested that MHV-infection might have influenced the outcome of fertilization. Here, we present an experiment that tests this hypothesis. We infected randomly chosen mice with MHV and sham-infected control mice five days before pairing. We recovered the two-cell embryos from the oviduct, cultured them until the blastocyst stage, and determined the genotype of each resulting blastocyst by polymerase chain reaction. We found the pattern that we expected from our previous experiments: virus-infected mice produced more MHC-heterozygous embryos than sham-infected ones.

By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole primary data source. Integrating various sources of information, however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed reconstructions of transmission trees.

Because sP-sel induces a hypercoagulable state through PSGL-1 pathway to generate tissue factor-positive MPs, we hypothesized that the increase in plasma sP-sel levels can be a self-rescue response in hosts against the LT-mediated suppression of the coagulation system. In agreement with our hypothesis, our results indicated that compared with wild-type mice, Selp(−/−) and Selplg(−/−) mice were more sensitive to LT. In addition, the recombinant sP-sel treatment markedly ameliorated LT-mediated pathogenesis and reduced mortality. As a result, elicitation of circulating sP-sel is potentially a self-rescue response, which is beneficial to host recovery from an LT-induced hypocoagulation state.

ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular response.","This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response.","['This_observation', 'the_hypothesis', 'virion_binding', 'entry', 'the_spike_glycoprotein', '( GP(1,2', 'the_primary_stimulus', 'an_initial_response']","['This observation', 'the hypothesis', 'virion binding', 'entry', 'the spike glycoprotein', '( GP(1,2', 'the primary stimulus', 'an initial response']",This observation,the hypothesis,virion binding,entry,the spike glycoprotein,"( GP(1,2",the primary stimulus,an initial response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In PBS-treated SJL/J mice, the number of remyelinating axons per square millimeter of lesion area increased significantly 3 and 5 weeks after lysolecithin injection in the spinal cord. However, methylprednisolone or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), SCH94.03, developed for its ability to promote remyelination in the Theiler’s virus murine model of demyelination, further increased the number of remyelinating axons per lesion area at 3 weeks by a factor of 2.6 and 1.9, respectively, but did not increase the ratio of myelin sheath thickness to axon diameter or the number of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in the lesion. After 3 weeks, the number of remyelinating axons in the methylprednisolone or mAb SCH94.03 treatment groups was similar to the spontaneous remyelination in the 5 week PBS control-treated group, indicating that these treatments promoted remyelination by increasing its rate rather than its extent.

However, the impact of natural colds on children with asthma in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well defined.

Methods We studied 53 children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan, during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for 1 year.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults.","['these_hypotheses', 'fitting an_age-structured_mathematical_model', 'epidemic_data', 'six_countries', 'strong_age_dependence', 'the_probability', 'clinical_symptoms', 'around_20%', '10s', 'over_70%']","['these hypotheses', 'fitting an age-structured mathematical model', 'epidemic data', 'six countries', 'strong age dependence', 'the probability', 'clinical symptoms', 'around 20%', '10s', 'over 70%']",these hypotheses,fitting an age-structured mathematical model,epidemic data,six countries,strong age dependence,the probability,clinical symptoms,around 20%,10s,over 70%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span. METHODS: Here we collected 361 peri-centenarian individuals (age ≥94 for female and age ≥90 for male) and 342 geographically matched controls (age 22-53, mean 35.0 ± 12.0) from Han Chinese. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was determined by PCR and genotype was called by separating the PCR products in agarose gel. RESULTS: A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that there was absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population.

Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.","We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect.","['Vivo-Morpholinos', 'specific_regions', '3′_or_5′_untranslated_regions', 'JEV', 'an_experimental_model', 'JE']","['Vivo-Morpholinos', 'specific regions', '3′ or 5′ untranslated regions', 'JEV', 'an experimental model', 'JE']",Vivo-Morpholinos,specific regions,3′ or 5′ untranslated regions,JEV,an experimental model,JE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TGF-β expression in acute hantavirus infection. RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β2 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30–39 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-β1 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-β2 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-β1/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: High serum CRP and low serum TGF-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease.

Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are the first cells that influenza virus encounters upon entering the alveolus. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, which in turn induce damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are well known to regulate repair of damaged alveolar epithelium by stimulating cell migration and proliferation. Recently, TGF-α/EGFR signaling has also been shown to regulate innate immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells. However, little is known about whether HGF/c-Met signaling alters the innate immune responses and whether the innate immune responses in AECs are regulated by HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR. We hypothesized that HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR would regulate innate immune responses to influenza A virus infection in human AECs. We found that recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) and rhTGF-α stimulated primary human AECs to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly and IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 moderately. Influenza infection stimulated the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF by AECs plated on rat-tail collagen through EGFR activation likely by TGF-α released from AECs and through c-Met activated by HGF secreted from lung fibroblasts. HGF secretion by fibroblasts was stimulated by AEC production of prostaglandin E(2) during influenza infection.

Although several vaccines against these viruses are commercially available there is room for improvement, especially in the case of PRRSV. The ability of arteriviruses to counteract the immune response is thought to decrease the efficacy of the current modified live virus vaccines. We have recently shown that the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of EAV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) is important for the inhibition of innate immune activation during infection. A vaccine virus lacking PLP2 DUB activity may therefore be more immunogenic and provide improved protection against subsequent challenge than its DUB-competent counterpart. To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two groups were vaccinated, either with DUB-positive (n =9) or DUB-negative (n =9) recombinant EAV. The third group (n =2) was not vaccinated. All horses were subsequently challenged with the virulent KY84 strain of EAV. Both vaccine viruses proved to be replication competent in vivo. In addition, the DUB-negative virus provided a similar degree of protection against clinical disease as its DUB-positive parental counterpart. Owing to the already high level of protection provided by the parental virus, a possible improvement due to inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Taken together, the data obtained in this study warrant further in vivo investigations into the potential of using DUB-mutant viruses for the improvement of arterivirus vaccines.","To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups.","['this_hypothesis', 'twenty_Shetland_mares', 'three_groups']","['this hypothesis', 'twenty Shetland mares', 'three groups']",this hypothesis,twenty Shetland mares,three groups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On this basis, we hypothesized that ACE-2 would be protective against experimental lung fibrogenesis and might be downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. In lung biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, ACE-2 mRNA and enzyme activity were decreased by 92% (P < 0.01) and 74% (P < 0.05), respectively. ACE-2 mRNA and activity were also decreased similarly in the lungs of bleomycin-treated rats and C57-BL6 mice. In mice exposed to low doses of bleomycin, lung collagen accumulation was enhanced by intratracheal administration of either ACE-2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or the peptide DX(600), a competitive inhibitor of ACE-2 (P < 0.05). Administration of either ACE-2 siRNA or DX(600) significantly increased the ANG II content of mouse lung tissue above the level induced by bleomycin alone. Coadministration of the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin blocked the DX(600)-induced increase in lung collagen. Moreover, purified recombinant human ACE-2, delivered to mice systemically by osmotic minipump, attenuated bleomycin-induced lung collagen accumulation.

Methods Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group).

Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named ‘hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients.

Approximately 63 amino acid residues encoded in HCV render this channel sensitive to inhibitors, making p7 a promising target for novel therapies. HCV p7 protein forms a small membrane known as viroporin, and is essential for effective self-assembly of large channels that conduct cation assembly and discharge infectious virion particles. METHOD: In this study, we screened drugs and flavonoids known to disrupt translation and production of HCV proteins, targeted against the active site of p7 residues of HCV genotype 3 (GT3) (isolatek3a) and HCV genotype 4a (GT4) (isolateED43). Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative structure–activity relationship and docking interaction study. RESULTS: The drug NB-DNJ formed the highest number of hydrogen bond interactions with both modeled p7 proteins with high interaction energy, followed by BIT225. A flavonoid screen demonstrated that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), nobiletin, and quercetin, have more binding modes in GT3 than in GT4. Thus, the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential. This structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds, confirming p7 as a new target in the rapidly increasing era of HCV.","We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential.","['the_inhibitors', 'viral_p7', 'a_new_class', 'potent_agents', 'further_confirmation', 'vitro', 'vivo']","['the inhibitors', 'viral p7', 'a new class', 'potent agents', 'further confirmation', 'vitro', 'vivo']",the inhibitors,viral p7,a new class,potent agents,further confirmation,vitro,vivo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, irreversible and debilitating lung disease showing fibroblast/myofibroblast expansion and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the interstitium leading to breathing difficulty. Our previous observation revealed a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We hypothesize that Cordyceps has beneficial effects on lung fibrosis and the objective of this study is to explore the target(s) of Cordyceps in the relief of lung fibrosis in animal and cell models and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms. Material and methods A rat model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis and a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction were employed in the studies. Results Reduction of infiltration of inflammatory cells, deposition of fibroblastic loci and collagen, formation of reactive oxygen species, and production of cytokines, as well as recovery from imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1, were observed in fibrotic rats after treatment with Cordyceps in preventive (from the day of BLM administration) and therapeutic (from 14 days after BLM) regimens. In a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction, the human lung epithelial A549 acquired a mesenchymal phenotype and an increase of vimentin expression with a concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. This epithelial–mesenchymal transition could be partially reverted by cordycepin, a major component of Cordyceps.

In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent- dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium binding studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (Kd = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals.

The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life.

However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture.

Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5′ to 3′ folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding.

The part-worth values for the trip product elements are expected to depend on a number of traveler characteristics. The predictors hypothesized are city travel experience, general modal preference, socio-economic status, and car ownership. In the survey, the combinations of trip attributes differed between the two subgroups of leisure and business travelers. The leisure travelers rated three levels of mode, length of stay, and price, but only one level of the hotel category. The business travelers were shown four mode alternatives and only two levels for each of the other trip product elements. The conjoint measurements were elaborated by fitting an Extended Bradley–Terry Model. Demonstrating the application of the EBTM is the main purpose of the paper. The EBTM offers several advantages over the more popular versions of conjoint analysis. It correctly treats ties and allows for simultaneous estimation of the trip package (‘object’) parameters, object covariates (trip attributes), subject covariates (traveler characteristics) and their interactions. For both the business and the leisure travelers, the mode of transport dominated the assessment of a city trip package. For leisure tourists, e.g., switching from train 2nd class to an economy flight boosted the trip package more than twice as much as replacing train for bus. A variation of the package price was much more important for the leisure than for the business travelers. The socio-economic status proved to be an important factor and was particularly influential among the business travelers. In the leisure tourists' sub-sample age was not only important for valuing the mode of transport, but had a preferential impact for all trip components. Finally, the limitations of this demonstration study that discourage extrapolation to city travelers in general are emphasized.","The predictors hypothesized are city travel experience, general modal preference, socio-economic status, and car ownership.","['The_predictors', 'city_travel_experience', 'general_modal_preference', 'socio-economic_status', 'car_ownership']","['The predictors', 'city travel experience', 'general modal preference', 'socio-economic status', 'car ownership']",The predictors,city travel experience,general modal preference,socio-economic status,car ownership,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning, whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations. These limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles. Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection. Depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment. Moreover, data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia, reduced bodily iron stores, conservation/withdrawal behavior, hypervigilance and anorexia. By shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world, the Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm, whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function.","Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection.","['studies', 'risk_alleles', 'depression', 'PubMed', 'Ovid_MEDLINE', 'data', 'the_hypothesis', 'risk', 'alleles', 'depression', 'the_human_genome', 'these_alleles', 'promote', 'an_integrated_suite', 'immunological_and_behavioral_responses']","['studies', 'risk alleles', 'depression', 'PubMed', 'Ovid MEDLINE', 'data', 'the hypothesis', 'risk', 'alleles', 'depression', 'the human genome', 'these alleles', 'promote', 'an integrated suite', 'immunological and behavioral responses']",studies,risk alleles,depression,PubMed,Ovid MEDLINE,data,the hypothesis,risk,alleles,depression,the human genome,these alleles,promote,an integrated suite,immunological and behavioral responses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. RESULTS: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor. Putative factors may be geographic variations in specific virus strains and rate of vaccination. Knowledge of these factors and the geographical distributions of these infections can inform recommendations for testing, management and prevention. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association of these factors with FIV and FeLV.","Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar.","['both_infections', 'North_America', 'a_working_hypothesis', 'their_geographic_distributions']","['both infections', 'North America', 'a working hypothesis', 'their geographic distributions']",both infections,North America,a working hypothesis,their geographic distributions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Often no pathogen is detected and it is unclear whether this is because pathogens are absent in some patients or the investigations used fail to detect them. The hypothesis that AIDS related diarrhoea is usually due to an infection, which can be identified by a simple diagnostic strategy based on the results of intensive investigation of a cohort of such patients, was investigated. METHODS: 155 patients with AIDS and chronic diarrhoea underwent contemporaneous examination of stools, duodenal, jejunal, and rectal biopsy specimens and duodenal aspirate for bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens. A decision tree analysis was used to determine the best sequential diagnostic strategy for clinicians. RESULTS: 128 of 155 patients investigated (83%) had at least one potential pathogen. The presenting clinical features could not predict the presence or site of the pathogens. Stool analysis identified the most pathogens (93 of 199, 47%). Rectal biopsy was essential for the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and adenovirus. Duodenal biopsy was as helpful as jejunal biopsy and detected some treatable pathogens missed by other methods. Electron microscopy, impression smears, and duodenal aspirate yielded little extra information. If gut biopsy was reserved for patients without a stool pathogen, some treatable pathogens would have been missed. CONCLUSION: Most patients with AIDS and chronic diarrhoea have at least one gut pathogen, which can be identified by stool analysis and light microscopic examination of duodenal and rectal biopsies.

We examined the pathogenic effects of the viruses in chicken embryos and the size and morphology of the virus particles, performed phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene and complete genomic sequences, and examined the antibody responses against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The results suggested that the viruses I0623/17 and I0710/17 were avian coronaviruses and were identified as pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), with greatest similarity to IBV. Further investigations of the antigenicity, complete genome organization, substitutions in multiple genes, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants showed obvious differences between PhCoV and IBV in terms of antigenicity, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants. The close genetic relationship, but obvious differences between PhCoVs and IBVs suggested the IBVs could be the ancestors of PhCoVs, and that PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks may have evolved independently from IBVs circulating in the specific region by adaption in pheasants. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the S1 gene fragments of the two PhCoVs isolated in the current study, as well as PhCoVs isolated in the UK and selected IBV strains. Such analyses indicated different evolution patterns and different tissue tropisms between PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks.

Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinant FMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A(24) Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers were further compared to 2 naïve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers. Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response–such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells–were significantly overrepresented. Differential gene expression was significantly correlated between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (biological correlation +0.97), indicating a similar transcriptome profile across these groups.

Previous studies demonstrate that SM is acquired by a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway, although paradoxically, this pathway is dispensable for bacterial replication. This finding suggests that other lipid transport mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of host SM. In this work, we interrogated the role of specific components of BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways to define their contribution in SM acquisition during infection. We found that C. trachomatis hijacks components of both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways for SM acquisition but that the SM obtained from these separate pathways is being utilized by the pathogen in different ways. We show that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts only one of the three known BFA targets, GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. The Arf1/GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition is essential for inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not required for bacterial replication. In contrast, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts CERT, a lipid transfer protein that is a key component in non-vesicular ER to trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (the precursor for SM), for C. trachomatis replication. We demonstrate that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner, VAP-A, and SM synthases, SMS1 and SMS2, to the inclusion and propose that these proteins establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion. We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability.

Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information. RESULTS: We present a new method, Iterative HFold, for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction. Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of IPknot, and with about 35% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of HotKnots V2.0 while being significantly faster.

The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 °C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 °C (3.7 min), 80 °C (2.4 min), and 90 °C (2.3 min) compared with 60 °C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 °C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.","Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces.","['outbreak_investigations', 'the_virus', 'contaminated_feed', 'contaminated_feed_surfaces']","['outbreak investigations', 'the virus', 'contaminated feed', 'contaminated feed surfaces']",outbreak investigations,the virus,contaminated feed,contaminated feed surfaces,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.","Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses.","['the_relative_contributions', 'these_three_alternative_hypotheses']","['the relative contributions', 'these three alternative hypotheses']",the relative contributions,these three alternative hypotheses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms.","Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma.","['the_role', 'respiratory_viruses', 'asthma', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', 'our_recent_findings', 'HI', 'IV', 'allergens', 'protection', 'experimental_asthma']","['the role', 'respiratory viruses', 'asthma', 'the hygiene hypothesis', 'our recent findings', 'HI', 'IV', 'allergens', 'protection', 'experimental asthma']",the role,respiratory viruses,asthma,the hygiene hypothesis,our recent findings,HI,IV,allergens,protection,experimental asthma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia: although viruses are the most common etiologic agent, the severity of clinical symptoms associated with bacterial pneumonia and increasing antibiotic resistance makes bacterial pneumonia a major public health concern. Bacterial pneumonia can follow upper respiratory viral infection and complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of influenza-related deaths. In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions. We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT. However, it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in pneumonia etiology. The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co-infection, increased carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia has been established.","In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i)","['this_review', 'the_following_hypotheses', '( i']","['this review', 'the following hypotheses', '( i']",this review,the following hypotheses,( i,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BASIGIN controls tumour metabolism, particularly glycolysis by facilitating lactic acid export through the two monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4. However, before being recognized as a co-carrier of MCTs, BASIGIN was described as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Early on, a model emerged in which, tumour cells use the extracellular domain of BASIGIN to recognize and stimulate neighbouring fibroblasts to produce MMPs. However, this model has remained hypothetical since a direct link between BASIGIN and MMPs production has not yet been clearly established. To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma. By using co-culture experiments of either human or mouse fibroblasts and tumour cell lines we showed, contrary to what has been abundantly published, that the disruption of BASIGIN in tumour cells and in MEFs has no action on the production of MMPs. Our findings do not support the notion that the pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated via induction of MMPs. Therefore, we propose that to date, the strongest pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated through the control of fermentative glycolysis.","To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma.","['the_BASIGIN/MMP_hypothesis', 'BASIGIN_knockouts', 'three_human_tumour_cell_lines', 'glioma', 'colon', 'lung_adenocarcinoma']","['the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis', 'BASIGIN knockouts', 'three human tumour cell lines', 'glioma', 'colon', 'lung adenocarcinoma']",the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis,BASIGIN knockouts,three human tumour cell lines,glioma,colon,lung adenocarcinoma,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The microtubule-associated molecular motor, cytoplasmic dynein, has been implicated in the retrograde movement of Ad. We hypothesized that cytoplasmic dynein constituted the primary mode of association of Ad with microtubules. To evaluate this hypothesis, an Ad-microtubule binding assay was established in which microtubules were polymerized with taxol, combined with Ad in the presence or absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and centrifuged through a glycerol cushion. The addition of purified bovine brain MAPs increased the fraction of Ad in the microtubule pellet from 17.3% ± 3.5% to 80.7% ± 3.8% (P < 0.01). In the absence of tubulin polymerization or in the presence of high salt, no Ad was found in the pellet. Ad binding to microtubules was not enhanced by bovine brain MAPs enriched for tau protein or by the addition of bovine serum albumin. Enhanced Ad-microtubule binding was also observed by using a fraction of MAPs purified from lung A549 epithelial cell lysate which contained cytoplasmic dynein. Ad-microtubule interaction was sensitive to the addition of ATP, a hallmark of cytoplasmic dynein-dependent microtubule interactions. Immunodepletion of cytoplasmic dynein from the A549 cell lysate abolished the MAP-enhanced Ad-microtubule binding. The interaction of Ad with both dynein and dynactin complexes was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation.

Work-related critical incidents may induce post-traumatic stress symptoms or even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression and may negatively affect health care practitioners’ behaviors toward patients. Nurses and doctors often cope by working part time or switching jobs. Hospital administrators and health care practitioners themselves may underestimate the effects of work-related critical incidents. Relevant online databases were searched for original research published from inception to 2009 and manual searches of the Journal of Traumatic Stress, reference lists, and the European Traumatic Stress Research Database were conducted. Two researchers independently decided on inclusion and study quality. Effect sizes were estimated using standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Consistency was evaluated, using the I 2-statistic. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Eleven studies, which included 3866 participants, evaluated the relationship between work-related critical incidents and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Six of these studies, which included 1695 participants, also reported on the relationship between work-related critical incidents and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Heterogeneity among studies was high and could not be accounted for by study quality, character of the incident, or timing of data collection. Pooled effect sizes for the impact of work-related critical incidents on post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression were small to medium.

However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi also plays a role in antiviral mechanism in mammalian cells. To combat RNAi-mediated antiviral responses, many viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSR) to facilitate their replication. VSRs have been widely studied for plant and insect viruses, but only a few have been defined for mammalian viruses currently. We identified a novel VSR from coronaviruses, a group of medically important mammalian viruses including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and showed that the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of coronaviruses suppresses RNAi triggered by either short hairpin RNAs or small interfering RNAs in mammalian cells. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is closely related to SARS-CoV in the family Coronaviridae and was used as a coronavirus replication model. The replication of MHV increased when the N proteins were expressed in trans, while knockdown of Dicer1 or Ago2 transcripts facilitated the MHV replication in mammalian cells. These results support the hypothesis that RNAi is a part of the antiviral immunity responses in mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE RNAi has been well known to play important antiviral roles from plants to invertebrates. However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi is also involved in antiviral response in mammalian cells. An important indication for RNAi-mediated antiviral activity in mammals is the fact that a number of mammalian viruses encode potent suppressors of RNA silencing. Our results demonstrate that coronavirus N protein could function as a VSR through its double-stranded RNA binding activity. Mutational analysis of N protein allowed us to find out the critical residues for the VSR activity. Using the MHV-A59 as the coronavirus replication model, we showed that ectopic expression of SARS-CoV N protein could promote MHV replication in RNAi-active cells but not in RNAi-depleted cells. These results indicate that coronaviruses encode a VSR that functions in the replication cycle and provide further evidence to support that RNAi-mediated antiviral response exists in mammalian cells.",These results support the hypothesis that RNAi is a part of the antiviral immunity responses in mammalian cells.,"['These_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'RNAi', 'a_part', 'the_antiviral_immunity_responses', 'mammalian_cells']","['These results', 'the hypothesis', 'RNAi', 'a part', 'the antiviral immunity responses', 'mammalian cells']",These results,the hypothesis,RNAi,a part,the antiviral immunity responses,mammalian cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that postnatal maturation causes developmental change in brainstem efferent airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) within the rostral nucleus ambiguus (rNA) that project to the airways, and in pulmonary afferent fibers that terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Ferrets aged 7, 14, 21 and 42 days received intrapulmonary injection of Cholera toxin β subunit (CT-b), a transganglionic retrograde tracer. Five days later, their brainstem was processed for dual immunolabeling of CT-b and the cholinergic marker, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT). CT-b labeled AVPNs and CT-b labeled afferent fiber optical density were analyzed. There was a significantly higher CT-b labeled cell number within the rNA at the youngest compared to older ages. All efferent CT-b labeled cells expressed ChAT. Optical density of CT-b labeled afferent fibers was also higher at 7 compared to 14 days. We conclude that the number of efferent AVPNs and afferent fiber optical density both diminish over the second postnatal week.

Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones.","['The_results', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_clones', 'topical_antiseptics', 'transmission', 'endemic_clones']","['The results', 'support', 'the hypothesis', 'the clones', 'topical antiseptics', 'transmission', 'endemic clones']",The results,support,the hypothesis,the clones,topical antiseptics,transmission,endemic clones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples were obtained from suspected SARS patients with major clinical symptoms and a significant history of close contact with infected patients. Total RNAs were extracted in a 96-well format, together with pig kidney epithelial (PK-15) cells as an internal control for extraction efficiency. PCR inhibitors were removed by ethanol precipitation, and a PCR for the pig β-actin gene was used as a positive control for all clinical samples. Samples were analyzed by a reverse transcriptase PCR assay. Northern blot analysis was performed to demonstrate differences in subgenomic transcripts of the virus, and a real-time quantitative PCR was employed to compare the sensitivities of two loci (1b and N). The detection rate of the assay reached 44.4% on day 9 after the onset of the disease. The diagnostic PCR amplifying the N gene gave an average of a 26.0% (6.3 to 60.0%) stronger intensity signal than that for the 1b gene.

Because elderly individuals are vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections, these microbial agents may be considered important comorbidities that could potentiate an already existing and tenuous inflammatory condition in the brain, accelerating cognitive decline, particularly if the cellular and molecular mechanisms can be defined. Researchers have recently demonstrated that triggering inflammation in the brain exacerbates tau pathological characteristics in animal models. Herein, we explore whether inflammation induced via viral infection, compared with inflammation induced via bacterial lipopolysaccharide, modulates AD-like pathological features in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infectious agents may act as a comorbidity for AD. Our study shows that infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation significantly exacerbates tau pathological characteristics, with chronic inflammation leading to impairments in spatial memory. Tau phosphorylation was increased via a glycogen synthase kinase-3β–dependent mechanism, and there was a prominent shift of tau from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble fraction. During chronic inflammation, we found that inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity with lithium reduced tau phosphorylation and the accumulation of insoluble tau and reversed memory impairments. Taken together, infectious agents that trigger central nervous system inflammation may serve as a comorbidity for AD, leading to cognitive impairments by a mechanism that involves exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics.","Herein, we explore whether inflammation induced via viral infection, compared with inflammation induced via bacterial lipopolysaccharide, modulates AD-like pathological features in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infectious agents may act as a comorbidity for AD.","['Herein', 'inflammation', 'viral_infection', 'inflammation', 'bacterial_lipopolysaccharide', 'AD-like_pathological_features', 'the_3xTg-AD_mouse_model', 'evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'infectious_agents', 'a_comorbidity', 'AD']","['Herein', 'inflammation', 'viral infection', 'inflammation', 'bacterial lipopolysaccharide', 'AD-like pathological features', 'the 3xTg-AD mouse model', 'evidence', 'the hypothesis', 'infectious agents', 'a comorbidity', 'AD']",Herein,inflammation,viral infection,inflammation,bacterial lipopolysaccharide,AD-like pathological features,the 3xTg-AD mouse model,evidence,the hypothesis,infectious agents,a comorbidity,AD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that counteract the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN also functions to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(−)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(−) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-deficient (IFNAR(−/−)) BMMs. ExoN(−) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(−) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to those of untreated samples. However, ExoN(−) virus generated from IFN-β-pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(−) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest murine hepatitis virus (MHV) ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response, and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity. IMPORTANCE CoVs encode multiple antagonists that prevent or disrupt an efficient innate immune response. Additionally, no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines currently exist for human CoV infections. Therefore, the study of CoV innate immune antagonists is essential for understanding how CoVs overcome host defenses and to maximize potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we sought to determine the contributions of nsp14 ExoN activity in the induction of and resistance to the innate immune response. We show that viruses lacking nsp14 ExoN activity are more sensitive than wild-type MHV to restriction by exogenous IFN-β and that viruses produced in the presence of an antiviral state are less capable of establishing a subsequent viral infection.

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1°C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.","It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world.","['exhibits', 'seasonality', 'changing_temperatures', 'the_coming_months', 'transmission_patterns', 'the_world']","['exhibits', 'seasonality', 'changing temperatures', 'the coming months', 'transmission patterns', 'the world']",exhibits,seasonality,changing temperatures,the coming months,transmission patterns,the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARγ2). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPARγ2 expression in either ON(+ )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group.

Therefore, I reviewed the literature on LPAIV infections in wild waterbirds. The virulence of LPAIV was assessed in 17 studies on experimental infections and nine studies on natural infections. Reported evidence for virulence were reductions in return rate, feeding rate, body weight, long-range movement and reproductive success, as well as pathological changes in infected organs. However, major caveats in studies of experimental infections were unnatural route of LPAIV inoculation, animal husbandry not simulating natural stressors and low sensitivity of clinical assessment. Major caveats in studies of natural infections were incomplete measurement of LPAIV infection burden, quasi-experimental design and potential misclassification of birds. After taking these caveats into account, the only remaining evidence for virulence was that presence and intensity of LPAIV infection were negatively correlated with body weight. Based on this correlation, together with the demonstrated LPAIV tropism for the intestinal tract, I hypothesize that LPAIV reduces digestive tract function, and suggest how future studies could be directed to test this hypothesis.","Based on this correlation, together with the demonstrated LPAIV tropism for the intestinal tract, I hypothesize that LPAIV reduces digestive tract function, and suggest how future studies could be directed to test this hypothesis.","['this_correlation', 'the_demonstrated_LPAIV_tropism', 'the_intestinal_tract', 'LPAIV', 'digestive_tract_function', 'future_studies']","['this correlation', 'the demonstrated LPAIV tropism', 'the intestinal tract', 'LPAIV', 'digestive tract function', 'future studies']",this correlation,the demonstrated LPAIV tropism,the intestinal tract,LPAIV,digestive tract function,future studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity. Trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and Nagana in livestock in sub-Saharan endemic areas. In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.","Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice.","['trypanosome_infection', 'the_onset', 'CIA', 'specifically dampening specific_B-cell_responses', 'II_collagen_antibody_titers', 'DBA/1_prone_mice']","['trypanosome infection', 'the onset', 'CIA', 'specifically dampening specific B-cell responses', 'II collagen antibody titers', 'DBA/1 prone mice']",trypanosome infection,the onset,CIA,specifically dampening specific B-cell responses,II collagen antibody titers,DBA/1 prone mice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-seven rats reached the experimental end point at 3 mo after xenotransplantation and were euthanized for tissue harvest.

This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics.","We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved.","['the_structural_similarity', 'complementarity', 'these_trimeric_collectins', 'the_trimeric_viral_fusion_proteins']","['the structural similarity', 'complementarity', 'these trimeric collectins', 'the trimeric viral fusion proteins']",the structural similarity,complementarity,these trimeric collectins,the trimeric viral fusion proteins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia.

Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). METHODS: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.

For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved.

Results HBoV1 was detected in NPAs from 10% of patients and 17% of controls. Adjusted for age, gender and the presence of other viruses, HBoV1 was not associated with RTI. In the HBoV1-positive NPAs, at least one other virus was detected in 75% and the virus appeared alone in 25%. Adjusted for age and gender, the detection of HBoV1 as the sole virus was associated with RTI, but not with LRTI. Viraemia was found only in children with RTI. The study showed that it was associated with RTI and LRTI. A high HBoV1-load was associated with LRTI, but not with RTI. No interactions between HBoV1 and other infectious agents were found. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group. However, HBoV1 is common in healthy children.","Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group.","['Conclusions Our_data support', 'the_hypothesis', 'RTI', 'children', 'detection', 'HBoV1', 'viraemia', 'high_viral_load', 'RTI', 'LRTI', 'this_age_group']","['Conclusions Our data support', 'the hypothesis', 'RTI', 'children', 'detection', 'HBoV1', 'viraemia', 'high viral load', 'RTI', 'LRTI', 'this age group']",Conclusions Our data support,the hypothesis,RTI,children,detection,HBoV1,viraemia,high viral load,RTI,LRTI,this age group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime. CONCLUSION: There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of isolation facilities. With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised.","Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary.","['differences', 'geography', 'population_density', 'national response', 'adherence', 'recommendations']","['differences', 'geography', 'population density', 'national response', 'adherence', 'recommendations']",differences,geography,population density,national response,adherence,recommendations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of RSV cbDVGs. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced a specific cbDVG based on variations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a common site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs generated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome are critical determinants of the location of cbDVG generation and, therefore, this is not a stochastic process. Most importantly, these findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome.Author summaryCopy-back defective viral genomes (cbDVGs) regulate infection and pathogenesis of Mononegavirales. cbDVG are believed to arise from random errors that occur during virus replication and the predominant hypothesis is that the viral polymerase is the main driver of cbDVG generation.

We identified specific nucleotides that when modified altered cbDVG generation at this position, and we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced cbDVGs based on mutations in this sequence.

Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-α supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-α responses.","We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection.","['this_hypothesis', 'pDC_functions', 'vivo', 'LCMV_infection', 'a_coordinated_downregulation', 'infant pDC maturation', 'activation', 'function', 'adult', 'vitro_activation_capacity', 'infant_pDCs', 'the_expression', 'the_E2-2_pDC_master_regulator', 'critical_downstream_antiviral_genes', 'MyD88', 'TLR7/TLR9', 'NF-κB', 'IRF7', 'IRF8', 'vivo', 'baseline', 'LCMV_infection']","['this hypothesis', 'pDC functions', 'vivo', 'LCMV infection', 'a coordinated downregulation', 'infant pDC maturation', 'activation', 'function', 'adult', 'vitro activation capacity', 'infant pDCs', 'the expression', 'the E2-2 pDC master regulator', 'critical downstream antiviral genes', 'MyD88', 'TLR7/TLR9', 'NF-κB', 'IRF7', 'IRF8', 'vivo', 'baseline', 'LCMV infection']",this hypothesis,pDC functions,vivo,LCMV infection,a coordinated downregulation,infant pDC maturation,activation,function,adult,vitro activation capacity,infant pDCs,the expression,the E2-2 pDC master regulator,critical downstream antiviral genes,MyD88,TLR7/TLR9,NF-κB,IRF7,IRF8,vivo,baseline,LCMV infection,,,,,,,,

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host’s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus.

We hypothesized that non-HTX CHD infants with CD will also have increased postoperative morbidity, particularly respiratory complications. METHODS: Sixty-three infants with non-HTX CHD undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled. Tests commonly used to assess for CD, nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurements and nasal epithelial ciliary motion (CM) assessment, were obtained. Baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Non-HTX CHD infants exhibited a high prevalence of abnormal CM (32%) and low nNO (39%). This was not correlated with demographics or surgical complexity. Infants with abnormal CM had increased odds of requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (OR 6.5, CI 1.5–29.4, P = 0.016) and respiratory medication use (OR 4.4, CI 1.5–13.3, P = 0.01). In contrast, infants with low nNO showed evidence of abnormal pre- and postoperative systolic function (40% vs. 4%; P = 0.004, and 34% vs. 13%; P = 0.056, respectively) and had higher odds of acquiring infections (OR 4.9, CI 1.4–17, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Non-HTX CHD infants with abnormal CM showed increased postoperative morbidity associated with poor respiratory outcomes. In contrast, low nNO correlated with reduced hemodynamic function. These findings suggest screening for abnormal CM may allow perioperative interventions to reduce pulmonary morbidities. Whether low nNO may prognosticate poor hemodynamic function warrants further investigation.","We hypothesized that non-HTX CHD infants with CD will also have increased postoperative morbidity, particularly respiratory complications.","['that_non-HTX_CHD_infants', 'CD', 'postoperative_morbidity', 'particularly_respiratory_complications']","['that non-HTX CHD infants', 'CD', 'postoperative morbidity', 'particularly respiratory complications']",that non-HTX CHD infants,CD,postoperative morbidity,particularly respiratory complications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of them do not have tRNAs, their translation relies on hosts' tRNA pools. Over the course of evolution, viruses needed to optimally exploit cellular processes of their host. Thus, codon usage of a virus should coevolve with its host to efficiently and rapidly replicate. Some viruses can invade a broad spectrum of hosts (BSTVs), while others can invade a narrow spectrum only (NSTVs). Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts. We compare the patterns of codon usage in 255 virus genomes to test this hypothesis. Our results show that NSTVs have a higher degree of matching to their hosts' tRNA pools than BSTVs. Further, analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) infers that codon usage bias of NSTVs is relatively stronger than that of BSTVs. Thus, codon usage of NSTVs tends to better match their host than that of BSTVs. This supports the hypothesis that viruses adapt to the expression system of their host(s).","Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts.","['the_hypothesis', 'that similarity', 'codon_usage_preference', 'the_degree', 'BSTVs', 'their_hosts', 'NSTVs', 'few_hosts']","['the hypothesis', 'that similarity', 'codon usage preference', 'the degree', 'BSTVs', 'their hosts', 'NSTVs', 'few hosts']",the hypothesis,that similarity,codon usage preference,the degree,BSTVs,their hosts,NSTVs,few hosts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS2 coliphage was used as a surrogate for pathogenic viruses. A viral droplet test system was constructed, and the size distribution of viral droplets loaded directly onto respirators was characterized using an aerodynamic particle sizer. The sizes ranged from 0.5 to 15 μm, and the sizes of the majority of the droplets were the range from 0.74 to 3.5 μm. The results also showed that the droplet test system generated similar droplet concentrations (particle counts) at different respirator locations. The test system was validated by studying the relative efficiencies of decontamination of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and UV irradiation with droplets containing MS2 virus on filtering facepiece respirators. It was hypothesized that more potent decontamination treatments would result in corresponding larger decreases in the number of viable viruses recovered from the respirators. Sodium hypochlorite doses of 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter with a 10-min decontamination period resulted in approximately 3- to 4-log reductions in the level of MS2 coliphage.

The viral envelope serves several functions, including protecting the RNA or DNA molecule(s), evading recognition by the immune system, and facilitating virus entry. Despite these commonalities, viral envelopes come in a wide variety of shapes and configurations. The evolution of the viral envelope is made more puzzling by the fact that nonenveloped viruses are able to infect a diverse range of hosts across the tree of life. We reviewed the entry, transmission, and exit pathways of all (101) viral families on the 2013 International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) list. By doing this, we revealed a strong association between the lack of a viral envelope and the presence of a cell wall in the hosts these viruses infect. We were able to propose a new hypothesis for the existence of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, in which the latter represent an adaptation to cells surrounded by a cell wall, while the former are an adaptation to animal cells where cell walls are absent. In particular, cell walls inhibit viral entry and exit, as well as viral transport within an organism, all of which are critical waypoints for successful infection and spread.

The first part addresses the many and not exclusive mechanisms leading to demyelination in the central nervous system. Although the hypothesis that a primary oligodendrocyte or myelin injury induces a secondary immune response in the central nervous system is still a matter of debate, most recent advances underline the influence of a primary immune response against myelin antigen(s), with a diversity of potential targets. Whereas multiple sclerosis was long considered as a T cell-mediated disease, the role of B lymphocytes is now increasingly recognized, and the influence of antibodies on tissue damage actively investigated. The second part of the review describes the axonal consequences of demyelination. Segmental demyelination results in conduction block or slowing of conduction through adaptative responses, notably related to modifications in the distribution of voltage gated sodium channels along the denuded axon. If demyelination persists, these changes, as well as the loss of trophic and metabolic support, will lead to irreversible axonal damage and loss. In this respect, favouring early myelin repair, during a window of time when axonal damage is still reversible, might pave the way for neuroprotection.","Although the hypothesis that a primary oligodendrocyte or myelin injury induces a secondary immune response in the central nervous system is still a matter of debate, most recent advances underline the influence of a primary immune response against myelin antigen(s), with a diversity of potential targets.","['the_hypothesis', 'a_primary_oligodendrocyte', 'myelin_injury', 'a_secondary_immune_response', 'the_central_nervous_system', 'a_matter', 'debate', 'most_recent_advances', 'the_influence', 'a_primary_immune_response', 'myelin', 'antigen(s', 'a_diversity', 'potential_targets']","['the hypothesis', 'a primary oligodendrocyte', 'myelin injury', 'a secondary immune response', 'the central nervous system', 'a matter', 'debate', 'most recent advances', 'the influence', 'a primary immune response', 'myelin', 'antigen(s', 'a diversity', 'potential targets']",the hypothesis,a primary oligodendrocyte,myelin injury,a secondary immune response,the central nervous system,a matter,debate,most recent advances,the influence,a primary immune response,myelin,antigen(s,a diversity,potential targets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial “danger detector.” pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3–Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain.

To understand how cellular conditions control capsid trafficking, we have tracked the subcellular fate of recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) vectors using confocal immunofluorescence, three-dimensional infection analysis, and subcellular fractionation. Here we report that a population of rAAV2 virions enters the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus after infection, whereas empty capsids are excluded from nuclear entry. Remarkably, after subcellular fractionation, virions accumulating in nucleoli were found to retain infectivity in secondary infections. Proteasome inhibitors known to enhance transduction were found to potentiate nucleolar accumulation. In contrast, hydroxyurea, which also increases transduction, mobilized virions into the nucleoplasm, suggesting that two separate pathways influence vector delivery in the nucleus. Using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, we then evaluated whether nucleolar proteins B23/nucleophosmin and nucleolin, previously shown to interact with AAV2 capsids, affect trafficking and transduction efficiency. Similar to effects observed with proteasome inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of nucleophosmin potentiated nucleolar accumulation and increased transduction 5- to 15-fold. Parallel to effects from hydroxyurea, knockdown of nucleolin mobilized capsids to the nucleoplasm and increased transduction 10- to 30-fold. Moreover, affecting both pathways simultaneously using drug and siRNA combinations was synergistic and increased transduction over 50-fold. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that rAAV2 virions enter the nucleus intact and can be sequestered in the nucleolus in stable form. Mobilization from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic sites likely permits uncoating and subsequent gene expression or genome degradation. In summary, with these studies we have refined our understanding of AAV2 trafficking dynamics and have identified cellular parameters that mobilize virions in the nucleus and significantly influence AAV infection.","Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that rAAV2 virions enter the nucleus intact and can be sequestered in the nucleolus in stable form.","['these_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'rAAV2_virions', 'the_nucleus', 'stable_form']","['these results', 'the hypothesis', 'rAAV2 virions', 'the nucleus', 'stable form']",these results,the hypothesis,rAAV2 virions,the nucleus,stable form,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives This study investigated serum concentrations of IP-10 in healthy individuals who developed acute respiratory infection (ARI). The hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and detection of viral pathogens. Study design Data come from a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of mindfulness meditation or exercise on ARI (Clinical Trials ID: NCT01654289). Healthy adults ages 30–69 were followed for a single season for ARI incidence and severity. This trial is ongoing, and the investigators are still blinded. When a participant reported ARI symptoms, nasal swab and lavage for PCR-based viral identification and blood samples were collected within the first 72h of ARI symptoms. Serum IP-10 concentrations were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc., Quantikine ELISA, Minneapolis, MN). ARI severity was measured using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) until the ARI episode resolved. Results Serum IP-10 concentrations from 225 ARI episodes correlated with ARI global severity (rho 0.28 [95% CI: 0.15–0.39]; p <0.001). IP-10 concentrations were higher with an ARI in which a viral pathogen was detected compared to no viral pathogen detected (median 366pg/ml [IQR: 227–486] vs 163pg/ml [IQR: 127–295], p <0.0001). Influenza infections had higher IP-10 concentrations than coronavirus, enterovirus or rhinovirus, and paramyxovirus. Conclusion Serum IP-10 concentration correlates with ARI global severity.

CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vβ chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vβ 14. Although Vβ8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vβ8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles.

No randomised controlled trials involving acute exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis have been published to our knowledge. We hypothesised that azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. Methods We did this parallel-group, double-dummy, double-blind, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial in three Australian and one New Zealand hospital between April, 2012, and August, 2016. We enrolled children aged 1–19 years with radiographically proven bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. At the start of an exacerbation, children were randomly assigned to oral suspensions of either amoxicillin–clavulanate (22·5 mg/kg, twice daily) and placebo or azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) and placebo for 21 days. We used permuted block randomisation (stratified by age, site, and cause) with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was resolution of exacerbation (defined as a return to baseline) by 21 days in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of −20%. We assessed several secondary outcomes including duration of exacerbation, time to next exacerbation, laboratory, respiratory, and quality-of-life measurements, and microbiology. This trial was registered with the Australian/New Zealand Registry (ACTRN12612000010897). Findings We screened 604 children and enrolled 236. 179 children had an exacerbation and were assigned to treatment: 97 to amoxicillin–clavulanate, 82 to azithromycin). By day 21, 61 (84%) of 73 exacerbations had resolved in the azithromycin group versus 73 (84%) of 87 in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group. The risk difference showed non-inferiority (−0·3%, 95% CI −11·8 to 11·1). Exacerbations were significantly shorter in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group than in the azithromycin group (median 10 days [IQR 6–15] vs 14 days [8–16]; p=0·014). Adverse events were attributed to the trial medication in 17 (21%) of 82 children in the azithromycin group versus 23 (24%) of 97 in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group (relative risk 0·9, 95% CI 0·5 to 1·5). Interpretation By 21 days of treatment, azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin–clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with non-severe bronchiectasis. In some patients, such as those with penicillin hypersensitivity or those likely to have poor adherence, azithromycin provides another option for treating exacerbations, but must be balanced with risk of treatment failure (within a 20% margin), longer exacerbation duration, and the risk of inducing macrolide resistance.

Virus budding is a poorly understood process that challenges current models of vesicle formation. Here, a plausible mechanism for arenavirus budding is presented, building on recent evidence that viral proteins embed in the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane. Experimental results confirm that viral protein is associated with increased membrane curvature, whereas a mathematical model is used to show that localized increases in curvature alone are sufficient to generate viral buds. The magnitude of the protein-induced curvature is calculated from the size of the amphipathic region hypothetically removed from the inner membrane as a result of translation, with a change in membrane stiffness estimated from observed differences in virion deformation as a result of protein depletion. Numerical results are based on experimental data and estimates for three arenaviruses, but the mechanisms described are more broadly applicable.

The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200–222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200–222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.","Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200–222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues.","['our_previous_studies', 'the_hypothesis', 'a_narrow_wavelength_window', 'the_far-UVC_region', 'around_200–222_nm', 'bacteria', 'damaging_cells', 'tissues']","['our previous studies', 'the hypothesis', 'a narrow wavelength window', 'the far-UVC region', 'around 200–222 nm', 'bacteria', 'damaging cells', 'tissues']",our previous studies,the hypothesis,a narrow wavelength window,the far-UVC region,around 200–222 nm,bacteria,damaging cells,tissues,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species. Information regarding host susceptibility to virus infection was collected to classify the cross-species infection propensity between hosts. Evolutionary divergence matrices and a sequence similarity scoring program were used to determine the distance and similarity of receptor sequences. The discriminant analysis was validated with cross-validation methods. The results showed that the primary structure of the receptor protein influences host susceptibility to cross-species viral infections. Pair-wise distance, relative distance, and sequence similarity showed the best accuracy in identifying the susceptible group. Based on the results of the discriminant analysis, we constructed ViCIPR (http://lcbb3.snu.ac.kr/ViCIPR/home.jsp), a server-based tool to enable users to easily extract the cross-species infection propensities of specific viruses using a simple two-step procedure. Our sequence-based approach suggests that it may be possible to identify virus transmission between hosts without requiring complex structural analysis. Due to a lack of available data, this method is limited to viruses whose receptor use has been determined. However, the significant accuracy of predictive variables that positively and negatively influence virus transmission suggests that this approach could be improved with further analysis of receptor sequences.","In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species.","['this_study', 'a_computational_framework', 'the_probability', 'virus_transmission', 'potential_hosts', 'the_hypothesis', 'virus_infection', 'differences', 'cell-receptor_sequences', 'species']","['this study', 'a computational framework', 'the probability', 'virus transmission', 'potential hosts', 'the hypothesis', 'virus infection', 'differences', 'cell-receptor sequences', 'species']",this study,a computational framework,the probability,virus transmission,potential hosts,the hypothesis,virus infection,differences,cell-receptor sequences,species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The location and properties of the FPs in the spike (S) glycoproteins of different coronaviruses (CoV) have not yet been determined. Through amino acid sequence analysis of S proteins of representative CoVs, we identified a common region as a possible FP (pFP) that shares the characteristics of FPs of class I viral fusion proteins, including high Ala/Gly content, intermediate hydrophobicity, and few charged residues. To test the hypothesis that this region contains the CoV FP, we systemically mutated every residue in the pFP of Middle East respiratory syndrome betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) and found that 11 of the 22 residues in the pFP (from G953 to L964, except for A956) were essential for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. The synthetic MERS-CoV pFP core peptide ((955)IAGVGWTAGL(964)) induced extensive fusion of liposome membranes, while mutant peptide failed to induce any lipid mixing. We also selectively mutated residues in pFPs of two other β-CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Although the amino acid sequences of these two pFPs differed significantly from that of MERS-CoV and each other, most of the pFP mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV also failed to mediate membrane fusion, suggesting that these pFPs are also the functional FPs. Thus, the FPs of 3 different lineages of β-CoVs are conserved in location within the S glycoproteins and in their functions, although their amino acid sequences have diverged significantly during CoV evolution. IMPORTANCE Within the class I viral fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses, the FP is the critical mediator of fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes leading to virus infection. FPs from within a virus family, like influenza viruses or human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), tend to share high amino acid sequence identity. In this study, we determined the location and amino acid sequences of the FPs of S glycoproteins of 3 β-CoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MHV, and demonstrated that they were essential for mediating cell-cell fusion and virus entry. Interestingly, in marked contrast to the FPs of influenza and HIV, the primary amino acid sequences of the FPs of β-CoVs in 3 different lineages differed significantly. Thus, during evolution the FPs of β-CoVs have diverged significantly in their primary sequences while maintaining the same essential biological functions.

PRRS was recognized in 1987 and within a few years became pandemic causing an estimated yearly $600,000 economic loss in the USA with comparative losses in most other countries. The causative agent is a single-stranded, positive-sense enveloped arterivirus (PRRSV) that infects macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Despite the discovery of PRRSV in 1991 and the publication of >2,000 articles, the control of PRRS is problematic. Despite the large volume of literature on this disease, the cellular and molecular mechanisms describing how PRRSV dysregulates the host immune system are poorly understood. We know that PRRSV suppresses innate immunity and causes abnormal B cell proliferation and repertoire development, often lymphopenia and thymic atrophy. The PRRSV genome is highly diverse, rapidly evolving but amenable to the generation of many mutants and chimeric viruses for experimental studies.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002–2003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN−) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN− CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN− population as compared to ExoN+. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.",All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function.,"['All_genetic_and_biochemical_data support', 'the_hypothesis', 'nsp14-ExoN']","['All genetic and biochemical data support', 'the hypothesis', 'nsp14-ExoN']",All genetic and biochemical data support,the hypothesis,nsp14-ExoN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection, axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice, infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment. In this scenario, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model).","We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination.","['axonal_damage', 'inflammatory_cells', 'sites', 'Wallerian_degeneration', 'demyelination']","['axonal damage', 'inflammatory cells', 'sites', 'Wallerian degeneration', 'demyelination']",axonal damage,inflammatory cells,sites,Wallerian degeneration,demyelination,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs. We have further hypothesized that the immunogenicity of highly conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) may be reduced or eliminated by their very weak or absent interactions with germline antibodies and immune responses leading to the elicitation of bnAbs may not be initiated and/or sustained. Even if such responses are initiated, the maturation pathways are so extraordinarily complex that prolonged periods of time may be required for elicitation of bnAbs with defined unique sequences. We provided the initial evidence supporting this antibody germline/maturation hypothesis, which prompted a number of studies to design vaccine immunogens that could bind putative germline predecessors of known bnAbs and to explore complex B cell lineages. However, guiding the immune system through the exceptionally complex antibody maturation pathways to elicit known bnAbs remains a major challenge. Here, we discuss studies exploring the antibody germline/maturation hypothesis as related to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 and present our recent data demonstrating the existence of germline-like precursors of VRC01 antibodies in a human cord blood IgM library.","Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs.","['germline_antibodies', 'the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein', '( Env', 'the_highly_somatically_mutated_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs']","['germline antibodies', 'the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein', '( Env', 'the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs']",germline antibodies,the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein,( Env,the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses. DISCUSSION: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days. During winter viral season, more than 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1189 infants. First year follow-up has been completed on over 95% percent of participants from the first year of enrollment. With ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes, the INSPIRE study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma.",Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses.,"['Nested_case-control_studies', 'other_primary_and_secondary_hypotheses']","['Nested case-control studies', 'other primary and secondary hypotheses']",Nested case-control studies,other primary and secondary hypotheses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In-host genetic diversity could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures such as host-switching events. Multiple new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples just within the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emergent human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of nearly 950×(454 sequencing) and 38,000×(Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the unpassaged samples and could quickly shift to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert coded for three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells, and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were “selected” from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.","Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were “selected” from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.","['Analysis', 'the_deep_sequencing_data', 'genotypes', 'each_sample', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_mutations', 'passaged_strains', 'a_pre-existing_pool', 'de_novo_mutation', 'subsequent_population_fixation']","['Analysis', 'the deep sequencing data', 'genotypes', 'each sample', 'the hypothesis', 'the mutations', 'passaged strains', 'a pre-existing pool', 'de novo mutation', 'subsequent population fixation']",Analysis,the deep sequencing data,genotypes,each sample,the hypothesis,the mutations,passaged strains,a pre-existing pool,de novo mutation,subsequent population fixation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most specimens were extensively autolysed, restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation.

The molecular characterization of viruses, based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene, allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red fox’s as feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and one stone marten’s as newCPV-2b type. The genetic similarity found between the FPLV viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in Portugal and publicly available comparable sequences, suggests a closer genetic relatedness among FPLV circulating in Portugal. Although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established, this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread, potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species, such as the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus).","Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR","['signs', 'active_disease', 'the_hypothesis', 'fragments', 'real-time_PCR']","['signs', 'active disease', 'the hypothesis', 'fragments', 'real-time PCR']",signs,active disease,the hypothesis,fragments,real-time PCR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and IPD in Ontario, Canada, using several complementary methodological tools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated a total number of 38,501 positive influenza tests in Central Ontario and 6,191 episodes of IPD in the Toronto/Peel area, Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 1995 and 3 October 2009, reported through population-based surveillance. We assessed the relationship between the seasonal wave forms for influenza and IPD using fast Fourier transforms in order to examine the relationship between these two pathogens over yearly timescales. We also used three complementary statistical methods (time-series methods, negative binomial regression, and case-crossover methods) to evaluate the short-term effect of influenza dynamics on pneumococcal risk. Annual periodicity with wintertime peaks could be demonstrated for IPD, whereas periodicity for influenza was less regular. As for long-term effects, phase and amplitude terms of pneumococcal and influenza seasonal sine waves were not correlated and meta-analysis confirmed significant heterogeneity of influenza, but not pneumococcal phase terms. In contrast, influenza was shown to Granger-cause pneumococcal disease. A short-term association between IPD and influenza could be demonstrated for 1-week lags in both case-crossover (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.10 [1.02–1.18]) and negative binomial regression analysis (incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.09 [1.05–1.14]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that influenza influences bacterial disease incidence by enhancing short-term risk of invasion in colonized individuals. The absence of correlation between seasonal waveforms, on the other hand, suggests that bacterial disease transmission is affected to a lesser extent.

This issue has received more and more attentions from academics. This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission. METHODS: The Eulerian–Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The dose–response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants. The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions. An in-flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation. A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors. A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system. RESULTS: The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols, significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin. The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered. The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers. CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important. For future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control.

Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.","From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences.","['this_hitherto_undescribed_relationship', 'the_gene_sequences', 'this_report', 'such_relationships', 'these_sequences', 'a_barrier', 'large_scale_sequence_alterations', 'override', 'such_characteristics', 'inbuilt', 'the_DNA_sequences']","['this hitherto undescribed relationship', 'the gene sequences', 'this report', 'such relationships', 'these sequences', 'a barrier', 'large scale sequence alterations', 'override', 'such characteristics', 'inbuilt', 'the DNA sequences']",this hitherto undescribed relationship,the gene sequences,this report,such relationships,these sequences,a barrier,large scale sequence alterations,override,such characteristics,inbuilt,the DNA sequences,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this process, particles acquire the outer capsid proteins and a transient envelope. Previous immunocytochemical and biochemical studies have suggested that a rotavirus nonstructural glycoprotein, NS28, encoded by genome segment 10, is a transmembrane RER protein and that about 10,000 Mr of its carboxy terminus is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the RER. We have used in vitro binding experiments to examine whether NS28 serves as a receptor that binds subviral particles and mediates the budding process. Specific binding was observed between purified simian rotavirus SA11 single-shelled particles and RER membranes from SA11-infected monkey kidney cells and from SA11 gene 10 baculovirus recombinant-infected insect cells. Membranes from insect cells synthesizing VP1, VP4, NS53, VP6, VP7, or NS26 did not possess binding activity. Comparison of the binding of single-shelled particles to microsomes from infected monkey kidney cells and from insect cells indicated that a membrane-associated component(s) from SA11-infected monkey kidney cells interfered with binding. Direct evidence showing the interaction of NS28 and its nonglycosylated 20,000-Mr precursor expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and single-shelled particles was obtained by cosedimentation of preformed receptor-ligand complexes through sucrose gradients. The domain on NS28 responsible for binding also was characterized. Reduced binding of single-shelled particles to membranes was seen with membranes treated with (i) a monoclonal antibody previously shown to interact with the C terminus of NS28, (ii) proteases known to cleave the C terminus of NS28, and (iii) the Enzymobead reagent. VP6 on single-shelled particles was suggested to interact with NS28 because (i) a monoclonal antibody to the subgroup I epitope on VP6 reduced particle binding, (ii) a purified polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant baculovirus-produced VP6 reduced ligand binding, and (iii) a monoclonal antibody to a conserved epitope on VP6 augmented ligand binding.

During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season.

Because effective therapies are lacking, early identification and mitigation of risk factors is a pragmatic approach to improve outcomes. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the most pervasive risk factor for CLAD, but diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy, which carries risks. We hypothesized that gene expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellet (CP) could replace biopsy and inform on mechanisms of CLAD. METHODS We performed RNA sequencing on BAL CPs from 219 lung transplant recipients with A-grade ACR (n = 61), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (n = 58), infection (n = 41), or no rejection/infection (n = 59). Differential gene expression was based on absolute fold difference >2.0 and Benjamini-adjusted p-value ≤0.05. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resource for pathway analyses. For classifier modeling, samples were randomly split into training (n = 154) and testing sets (n = 65). A logistic regression model using recursive feature elimination and 5-fold cross-validation was trained to optimize area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS Differential gene expression identified 72 genes. Enriched pathways included T-cell receptor signaling, natural killer cell–mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction. A 4-gene model (AUC = 0.72) and classification threshold defined in the training set exhibited fair performance in the testing set; accuracy was 76%, specificity 82%, and sensitivity 60%. In addition, classification as ACR was associated with worse CLAD-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.29–4.53).

While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less well studied and their potential roles in fungal dimorphism were largely unknown. Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P<0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1(KO), dcl-2(KO), dcl(DKO) and qde-2(KO) deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 (KD), supporting regulatory function of milRNAs.

The model accounts for stochastic interaction between bacteria and cells of the immune system and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection of individual hosts within a population. Model output is the dose–response relation and the dose-dependent distribution of time until response, where response is the onset of symptoms. The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium. Results indicate a median infectious dose of about 23 organisms, which is higher than previously thought, and an average incubation period of between 3 and 7 days depending on dose.

To test this hypothesis, we constructed 3 recombinant baculoviruses: Bac-P1 expressing P1; Bac-3CD expressing 3CD; and Bac-P1-3CD co-expressing P1 and 3CD. RESULTS: Both single infection by Bac-P1-3CD and co-infection by Bac-P1 and Bac-3CD resulted in correct cleavage of P1 to yield individual proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, while the former approach yielded higher VLP production. In the cells, the structural proteins self-assembled into clusters of virus-like particles (VLP) resembling the authentic EV71 particle aggregates. After ultracentrifugation purification, the dispersed VLPs were indistinguishable from the authentic virus in size, appearance, composition and surface epitopes, as determined by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling.

We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells.

In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412–419 (epitope I) and 434–446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection.

The relationship between cough and the severity of asthma is ill defined. A study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that, in children with asthma who cough as a major part of their asthma symptoms, cough receptor sensitivity (CRS) is heightened during an acute severe exacerbation of asthma but not in the non-acute phase and airway calibre or its change correlates with CRS. METHODS: Spirometric measurements and the capsaicin CRS test were performed on children admitted to hospital for an acute severe exacerbation of asthma. Nasal secretions were tested for viruses. The children were grouped into those who usually cough with asthma episodes and those who do not. The tests were repeated 7-10 days and 4-6 weeks later. The CRS outcome measure used was the concentration of capsaicin required to stimulate two (Cth) and five coughs (C5). RESULTS: The CRS of the group who coughed (n = 15) was significantly higher than those who did not cough (n = 16) (mean difference log Cth 0.77 mumol (95% CI 0.35 to 1.18), C5 0.72 mumol (95% CI 0.26 to 1.18)) during acute asthma but not after the exacerbation. CRS was not significantly different between groups based on the presence of a viral infection. Neither forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) nor its change correlated with CRS nor its change.

Air samplers are used to collect, identify, and quantify bioaerosols. Studies comparing the performances of air samplers have typically used a culture approach or have targeted a specific microorganism in laboratory settings. The objective of this study was to use environmental field samples to compare the efficiencies of 3 high-airflow-rate samplers for describing bioaerosol diversity using a next-generation sequencing approach. Two liquid cyclonic impactors and one electrostatic filter dry sampler were used in four wastewater treatment plants to target bacterial diversity and in five dairy farms to target fungal diversity. The dry electrostatic sampler was consistently more powerful in collecting more fungal and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Substantial differences in OTU abundances between liquid and dry sampling were revealed. The majority of the diversity revealed by dry electrostatic sampling was not identified using the cyclonic liquid impactors. The findings from this work suggest that the choice of a bioaerosol sampler should include information about the efficiency and ability of samplers to cover microbial diversity. Although these results suggest that electrostatic filters result in better coverage of the microbial diversity among the tested air samplers, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. While it is difficult to determine a single universally optimal air sampler, this work provides an in-depth look at some of the considerations that are essential when choosing an air sampler for studying the microbial ecology of bioaerosols. IMPORTANCE Associating bioaerosol exposure and health problems is challenging, and adequate exposure monitoring is a priority for scientists in the field. Conclusions that can be drawn from bioaerosol exposure studies are highly dependent on the design of the study and the methodologies used. The air sampling strategy is the first methodological step leading to an accurate interpretation of what is present in the air.

Microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation, but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critical role in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS. METHODS: The impact of CSF1R signaling during West Nile virus infection was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of neurotropic infection. Pharmacological inactivation of CSF1R was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging neuropathogen. The subsequent effect of CSF1R antagonism on virologic control was assessed by measuring mortality and viral titers in the CNS and peripheral organs. Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric-based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells. RESULTS: Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal WNV infection and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery. CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co-stimulatory signals on peripheral and CNS antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by depleting CNS cellular sources, which limited local reactivation of CNS-infiltrating virus-specific T cells and reduced viral clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following neurotropic viral infection. These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, which has been investigated as a therapeutic for neurodegenerative conditions, in which neuroinflammation is a contributing factor.

For efficient delivery, adenoviruses expressing the siRNAs were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered siRNAs was investigated in BHK-21 cells. When cells treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged with RABV, there was 88.35±2.4% and 41.52±9.3% reduction in RABV multiplication in infected cells with siRNAs targeting RABV-N and L genes, respectively. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR revealed knockdown of both RABV-N and L gene transcripts, however, significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N.

An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template.

Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution.

We hypothesized that such an excessive response to respiratory tract viral infection is caused by host factors reflected in pre-existing increased bronchial responsiveness. Objective We sought to compare bronchial responsiveness and lung function in 1-month-old neonates who later develop acute severe bronchiolitis with those who do not. Methods We measured infant lung function (n = 402) and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (n = 363) using the raised-volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique before any respiratory symptoms in 1-month-old neonates from the Copenhagen Prospective Study of Asthma in Childhood birth cohort born to mothers with asthma. The children were prospectively monitored for respiratory symptoms and given a diagnosis of acute severe bronchiolitis according to a fixed algorithm. Results Thirty-four (8.5%) infants had acute severe bronchiolitis before 2 years of age, 21 (62%) were hospitalized, and 23 (67%) of the cases were associated with respiratory syncytial virus. Children who later had acute severe bronchiolitis irrespective of viral species had a 2.5-fold increased responsiveness to methacholine (provocative dose of methacholine producing a 15% decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure [PD15]) at age 1 month compared with control subjects (median PD15 in cases vs control subjects, 0.13 vs 0.33 μmol; P = .01), whereas differences in baseline airflow were not significant for forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, −0.18 vs −0.01; P = .36) and forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, −0.37 vs −0.09; P = .13).

LPV binding to the highly susceptible human B-lymphoma cell line BJA-B K88 is specific, saturable, and noncooperative. Binding occurs very fast, with an association rate constant (k1) of 6.7 x 10(7) M-1s-1, and is of high affinity, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.9 x 10(-12) M; and the virus-receptor complex is stable, with a half life of 70 min. The binding affinities of receptors on four other highly, moderately, or weakly susceptible human B-lymphoma cell lines were similar, with up to twofold variation around a mean Kd value of 3 x 10(-12) M, suggesting the presence of the same LPV receptor on all of these cell lines. This view is further supported by the finding that in all cases a terminal sialic acid is necessary for LPV binding. Tunicamycin has been shown to drastically induce LPV susceptibility and LPV binding in weakly and moderately susceptible B-lymphoma cell lines (O.T. Keppler, M. Herrmann, M. Oppenländer, W. Meschede, and M. Pawlita, J. Virol. 68:6933-6939, 1994). The hypothesis that the constitutively expressed and tunicamycin-induced LPV receptors are identical is strengthened by our finding that both receptor types displayed the same high affinity. LPV susceptibility of different B-lymphoma cell lines was correlated with receptor number but not with receptor affinity. The numbers of receptors per cell on highly and moderately susceptible cell lines ranged from 2,000 to 400 and were directly proportional to LPV susceptibility.

Transient co-transfection assays indicated that Egr-1 negatively regulated the transcription of both full-length and intron-removed ICP22 promoters. The same assays also revealed that Egr-1 repressed ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4) promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but showed less inhibition when the intron was removed. Histone deacetylation was not involved in this regulation since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not exhibit any effect on Egr-1-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Egr-1 reduced the binding of Sp1 to the promoters and that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 in the presence of Egr-1. These results suggested that the multifunctional transcription factor Egr-1 can repress HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression through the recruitment of co-repressor Nab2 and reduction of Sp1 occupancy, and thus may play a critical role in HSV-1 gene silencing during latency.","Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression.","['Five_copies', 'early_growth_response_gene', 'the_intron', 'HSV-1', '( infected cell protein', 'No._22)_gene', 'the_hypothesis', 'Egr-1', 'the_viral_gene_expression']","['Five copies', 'early growth response gene', 'the intron', 'HSV-1', '( infected cell protein', 'No. 22) gene', 'the hypothesis', 'Egr-1', 'the viral gene expression']",Five copies,early growth response gene,the intron,HSV-1,( infected cell protein,No. 22) gene,the hypothesis,Egr-1,the viral gene expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis.","['TGEV', 'a_“bottom_up_scenario', 'the_traditional_“top_down”_hypothesis']","['TGEV', 'a “bottom up scenario', 'the traditional “top down” hypothesis']",TGEV,a “bottom up scenario,the traditional “top down” hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA polymerases (RNA(pol)) generate enormous genetic and consequent antigenic heterogeneity permitting both viruses and cellular pathogens to evade host defences. Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules – including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors – that viruses co-opt for cell entry.

Crazy because he decided to test in a human being a hypothesis based mainly in the traditional belief that people who had acquired cowpox from the udders of a cow were thereafter resistant to smallpox, a quite devastating disease, and lucky because (even considering that he did not know this at that time) he succeeded to induce protection against a pathogen through the induction of an immune response directed against a different agent. Not only was he able to protect the young man but he took the first step towards the development of a vast new field, vaccination. It is acceptable to say that Jenner was lucky because he succeeded in promoting protection against smallpox using a cowpox virus and this induction of protection in a cross-reactive way is believed to be quite rare. Nevertheless, more and more examples of cross-reactive immune responses are being described and we are beginning to admit that cross-reactivity is far more common and important than we used to think. Here we review cross-reactivity in the immune system and the plasticity of T cell recognition. Based on the existence of T cell receptor promiscuous recognition and cross-recognition of conserved viral immunodominant epitopes, we propose two approaches to develop wide spectrum viral vaccines. The first one is based on the identification, characterization, and cloning of immunodominant viral epitopes able to stimulate responses against different viruses. The produced peptides could then be purified and serve as a basis for vaccine therapies. A second strategy is based on the identification of conserved patterns in immunodominant viral peptides and the production of synthetic peptides containing the amino acid residues necessary for MHC anchoring and TCR contact. Although we are still far from a complete knowledge of the cross-reactivity phenomenon in the immune system, the analysis of immunodominant viral epitopes and the identification of particular “viral patterns” seems to be important steps towards the development of wide spectrum viral vaccines.","Crazy because he decided to test in a human being a hypothesis based mainly in the traditional belief that people who had acquired cowpox from the udders of a cow were thereafter resistant to smallpox, a quite devastating disease, and lucky because (even considering that he did not know this at that time) he succeeded to induce protection against a pathogen through the induction of an immune response directed against a different agent.","['a_hypothesis', 'the_traditional_belief', 'people', 'cowpox', 'the_udders', 'a_cow', 'smallpox', 'a_quite_devastating_disease', 'that_time', 'protection', 'a_pathogen', 'the_induction', 'an_immune_response', 'a_different_agent']","['a hypothesis', 'the traditional belief', 'people', 'cowpox', 'the udders', 'a cow', 'smallpox', 'a quite devastating disease', 'that time', 'protection', 'a pathogen', 'the induction', 'an immune response', 'a different agent']",a hypothesis,the traditional belief,people,cowpox,the udders,a cow,smallpox,a quite devastating disease,that time,protection,a pathogen,the induction,an immune response,a different agent,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One puzzle is that the potential repertoire greatly exceeds the realized diversity of naïve T cells within any individual. We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of “evolutionary sloppiness.” Another immunological puzzle is why mice and humans have similar repertoires even though humans have over 1000-fold more T cells. We discuss how the idea of the “protecton,” the smallest unit of protection, might explain this discrepancy and estimate the size of “protecton” based on available precursor frequencies data. We then consider T cell cross-reactivity – the ability of a T cell clone to respond to more than one epitope. We extend existing calculations to estimate the extent of expected cross-reactivity between the responses to different pathogens.

We demonstrated that better discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks by network entropy than by other topological metrics.

The recent discovery of a counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system composed of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas has led us to examine the role of this vasoprotective axis on such disorders. Objectives: We hypothesized that Ang-(1–7) treatment would exert protective effects against PF and PH. Methods: Lentiviral packaged Ang-(1–7) fusion gene or ACE2 cDNA was intratracheally administered into the lungs of male Sprague Dawley rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received bleomycin (2.5 mg/kg). In a subsequent study, animals were administered monocrotaline (MCT, 50 mg/kg). Measurements and Main Results: In the PF study, bleomycin administration resulted in a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which was associated with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. The lungs of these animals also exhibited excessive collagen deposition, decreased expression of ACE and ACE2, increased mRNA levels for transforming growth factor β and other proinflammatory cytokines, and increased protein levels of the AT(1)R. Overexpression of Ang-(1–7) significantly prevented all the above-mentioned pathophysiological conditions. Similar protective effects were also obtained with ACE2 overexpression. In the PH study, rats injected with MCT developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, all of which were attenuated by Ang-(1–7) overexpression. Blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1–7) against MCT-induced PH.

Mixed infections with Chlamydia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may result in generation of persistent chlamydial infections. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established. RESULTS: Infected cultures were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and re-infection experiments. By IF, Chlamydia-infected cells showed normal inclusions after 39 hpi. Dual infections with Chlamydia abortus revealed a heterogenous mix of inclusion types including small inclusions consisting of aberrant bodies (ABs), medium-sized inclusions consisting of ABs and reticulate bodies and normal inclusions. Only aberrant inclusions were observable in dual infection experiments with Chlamydia pecorum and PEDV. TEM examinations of mixed infections with Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum revealed aberrant chlamydial inclusions containing reticulate-like, pleomorphic ABs, which were up to 2 μm in diameter. No re-differentiation into elementary bodies (EBs) was detected. In re-infection experiments, co-infected cells produced fewer EBs than monoinfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirm that PEDV co-infection alters the developmental cycle of member species of the family Chlamydiaceae, in a similar manner to other well-described persistence induction methods. Interestingly, this effect appears to be partially species-specific as Chlamydia pecorum appears more sensitive to PEDV co-infection than Chlamydia abortus, as evidenced by TEM and IF observations of a homogenous population of aberrant inclusions in PEDV - Chlamydia pecorum co-infections.","To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established.","['an_in_vitro_model', 'dual_infection', 'cell_culture-adapted_PEDV', 'Chlamydia_abortus', 'Chlamydia_pecorum', 'Vero_cells']","['an in vitro model', 'dual infection', 'cell culture-adapted PEDV', 'Chlamydia abortus', 'Chlamydia pecorum', 'Vero cells']",an in vitro model,dual infection,cell culture-adapted PEDV,Chlamydia abortus,Chlamydia pecorum,Vero cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history.","['inference', 'visualization', 'hypothesis_testing', 'phylogeographic_history']","['inference', 'visualization', 'hypothesis testing', 'phylogeographic history']",inference,visualization,hypothesis testing,phylogeographic history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside of ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion.","['MHV-ExoN-AA', 'genetic_pathways', 'AA', 'DE', 'reversion']","['MHV-ExoN-AA', 'genetic pathways', 'AA', 'DE', 'reversion']",MHV-ExoN-AA,genetic pathways,AA,DE,reversion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An essential step in membrane remodeling is membrane fission, in which an initially continuous membrane surface is divided into multiple, separate compartments. The established view has been that membrane fission requires proteins with conserved structural features such as helical scaffolds, hydrophobic insertions, and polymerized assemblies. In this review we discuss these structure-based fission mechanisms and highlight recent findings from several groups that support an alternative, structure-independent mechanism of membrane fission. This mechanism relies on lateral collisions among crowded, membrane-bound proteins to generate sufficient steric pressure to drive membrane vesiculation. As a stochastic process, this mechanism contrasts with the paradigm that deterministic protein structures are required to drive fission, raising the prospect that many more proteins may participate in fission than previously thought. Paradoxically, our recent work suggests that intrinsically disordered domains may be among the most potent drivers of membrane fission, owing to their large hydrodynamic radii and substantial chain entropy. This stochastic view of fission also suggests new roles for the structure-based fission proteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that in addition to driving fission directly, the canonical fission machines may facilitate the enrichment and organization of bulky disordered protein domains in order to promote membrane fission by locally amplifying protein crowding.","Specifically, we hypothesize that in addition to driving fission directly, the canonical fission machines may facilitate the enrichment and organization of bulky disordered protein domains in order to promote membrane fission by locally amplifying protein crowding.","['addition', 'fission', 'the_canonical_fission_machines', 'the_enrichment', 'organization', 'bulky_disordered_protein_domains', 'order', 'membrane_fission', 'protein']","['addition', 'fission', 'the canonical fission machines', 'the enrichment', 'organization', 'bulky disordered protein domains', 'order', 'membrane fission', 'protein']",addition,fission,the canonical fission machines,the enrichment,organization,bulky disordered protein domains,order,membrane fission,protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies. To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations. They were panned against different HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG). Despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived IgM antibody repertoire, no enrichment for binders of Envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against RBD and sG; one of the selected monoclonal antibodies (against the RBD) was of high (nM) affinity with only few somatic mutations. These results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 compared to SARS CoV and Hendra virus. HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens.",We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs,"['the_germline_antibodies', 'the_mature_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs']","['the germline antibodies', 'the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs']",the germline antibodies,the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene mutations that disturb this turnover process may cause skin diseases. Human GASDERMIN A (GSDMA) is frequently silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and its overexpression has been reported to induce apoptosis. GSDMA has also been linked with airway hyperresponsiveness in genetic association studies. The function of GSDMA in the skin was deduced by dominant mutations in mouse gasdermin A3 (Gsdma3), which caused skin inflammation and hair loss. However, the mechanism for the autosomal dominance of Gsdma3 mutations and the mode of Gsdma3’s action remain unanswered. RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress. We showed that Gsdma3 is regulated by intramolecular fold-back inhibition, which is disrupted by dominant mutations in the C-terminal domain. The unmasked N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondrial via mitochondrial importer receptor Tom70, where it interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 and causes increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 as well as pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genetic mutations in the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 are gain-of-function mutations which unmask the N-terminal functional domain of Gsdma3. Gsdma3 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress through mitochondrial targeting.

The increase in BE in C57BL/6NJ mice was associated with a decrease in transcription of genes enriched for myelination in the striatum.

Following a three-week recovery period, mice were trained for BE in an intermittent, limited access procedure. Cuprizone induced similar weight loss in both substrains and sexes that recovered within 48 h after removal of the cuprizone diet. Surprisingly, cuprizone reduced BE in male but not female C57BL/6NJ mice while having no effect in C57BL/6J mice. Cuprizone also reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) at seven weeks post-cuprizone removal while having no effect on myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at this time point.

This Vpu function is intrinsically linked to its channel-like structure, which enables it to interfere with homologous transmembrane structures in infected cells. Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K+ channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane. Here, we found that the efficiency of Vpu-mediated viral release is inversely correlated with membrane potential polarization.

As a proof of concept, we show that HIV-1 release can be accelerated by externally imposed depolarization alone. Our findings identify the trigger of Vpu-mediated release as a manifestation of the general principle of depolarization-stimulated exocytosis.","Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K+ channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane.","['Vpu', 'host_background_K+_channels', 'Vpu', 'viral_release', 'destabilizing the_electric_field', 'a_budding_membrane']","['Vpu', 'host background K+ channels', 'Vpu', 'viral release', 'destabilizing the electric field', 'a budding membrane']",Vpu,host background K+ channels,Vpu,viral release,destabilizing the electric field,a budding membrane,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of needed breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the lab. In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today’s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues.",The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies.,"['The_importance', 'understanding', 'the_dynamics', 'zoonotic_pathogens', 'their_reservoir_hosts', 'a_tool', 'assess', 'risk_factors', 'spillover', 'hypotheses', 'treatment_and/or_intervention_strategies']","['The importance', 'understanding', 'the dynamics', 'zoonotic pathogens', 'their reservoir hosts', 'a tool', 'assess', 'risk factors', 'spillover', 'hypotheses', 'treatment and/or intervention strategies']",The importance,understanding,the dynamics,zoonotic pathogens,their reservoir hosts,a tool,assess,risk factors,spillover,hypotheses,treatment and/or intervention strategies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) has been demonstrated to be the cause of PMWS. However, other factors are needed for full development of the syndrome, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection has been suggested to be one of them. Twenty-four conventional 5-week-old pigs were distributed in four groups: control (n = 5), PRRSV inoculated (n = 5), PCV2 inoculated (n = 7), and PRRSV and PCV2 inoculated (n = 7). The two groups inoculated with PRRSV showed growth retardation. Pigs inoculated with both PRRSV and PCV2 had increased rectal temperature. One of these pigs developed wasting, had severe respiratory distress, and died. The most important microscopic lesion in pigs inoculated with PCV2 was lymphocyte depletion with histiocytic infiltration of the lymphoid organs, more severe and in a wider range of tissues in doubly inoculated pigs. Interstitial pneumonia was observed in the three inoculated groups. PCV2 nucleic acid was found by in situ hybridization in larger amounts and in a wider range of lymphoid tissues in PRRSV- and PCV2-inoculated than in PCV2-inoculated pigs. TaqMan PCR was performed to quantify the PCV2 loads in serum during the experiment. PCV2 loads were higher in doubly inoculated pigs than in pigs inoculated with PCV2 alone. These findings indicate that severe disease can be reproduced in conventional 5-week-old pigs by inoculation of PRRSV and PCV2.

Genetic evolution analysis indicates that all swine influenza viruses (SIVs) possessed full-length PA-X prior to 1985, but since then SIVs with truncated PA-X have gradually increased and become dominant, implying that truncation of this protein may contribute to the adaptation of influenza virus in pigs.

Viral infections trigger anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) responses by stimulating endosomal and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). However, viruses have also evolved many strategies to counteract IFN responses. Are there intracellular danger signals that enhance immune responses to viruses? During infection, viruses place a heavy demand on the protein folding machinery of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To survive ER stress, host cells mount an unfolded protein response (UPR) to decrease ER protein load and enhance protein-folding capacity. Viruses also directly elicit the UPR to enhance their replication. Increasing evidence supports an intersection between the host UPR and inflammation, in particular the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. The UPR directly activates pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription factors and dramatically enhances cytokine production in response to viral PRR engagement. Additionally, viral PRR engagement may stimulate specific pathways within the UPR to enhance cytokine production. Through these mechanisms, viral detection via the UPR and inflammatory cytokine production are intertwined. Consequently, the UPR response is perfectly poised to act as an infection-triggered “danger” signal. The UPR may serve as an internal “co-stimulatory” signal that (1) provides specificity and (2) critically augments responses to overcome viral subterfuge.

N- and C-terminal domains may harbor enzymatic functions important for viral mRNA synthesis, including capping enzymes or cap-snatching endoribonucleases. In the present study, we have employed a large-scale mutagenesis approach to map functionally relevant residues in these regions. The main targets were acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic residues (Lys and Arg) known to form catalytic and binding sites of capping enzymes and endoribonucleases. A total of 149 different mutants were generated and tested in the Lassa virus replicon system. Nearly 25% of evolutionarily highly conserved acidic and basic side chains were dispensable for function of L protein in the replicon context. The vast majority of the remaining mutants had defects in both transcription and replication. Seven residues (Asp-89, Glu-102, Asp-119, Lys-122, Asp-129, Glu-180, and Arg-185) were selectively important for mRNA synthesis. The phenotype was particularly pronounced for Asp-89, Glu-102, and Asp-129, which were indispensable for transcription but could be replaced by a variety of amino acid residues without affecting genome replication. Bioinformatics disclosed the remote similarity of this region to type IIs endonucleases. The mutagenesis was complemented by experiments with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin, demonstrating dependence of viral transcription from the cellular mRNA pool.

In addition to its broad antiviral activity, GRFT is stable at high temperature and at a broad pH range, displays little toxicity and immunogenicity, and is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Native GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer that binds to viral envelope glycoproteins and has displayed mid-picomolar activity in cell-based anti-HIV assays. Previously, we have engineered and analyzed several monomeric forms of this lectin (mGRFT) with anti-HIV EC(50) values ranging up to 323 nM. Based on our previous analysis of mGRFT, we hypothesized that the orientation and spacing of the carbohydrate binding domains GRFT were key to its antiviral activity. RESULTS: Here we present data on engineered tandem repeats of mGRFT (mGRFT tandemers) with antiviral activity at concentrations as low as one picomolar in whole-cell anti-HIV assays. mGRFT tandemers were analyzed thermodynamically, both individually and in complex with HIV-1 gp120. We also demonstrate by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy that mGRFT tandemers do not aggregate HIV virions. This establishes that, although the intra-virion crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins is likely integral to their activity, the antiviral activity of these lectins is not due to virus aggregation caused by inter-virion crosslinking. CONCLUSIONS: The engineered tandemer constructs of mGRFT may provide novel and powerful agents for prevention of infection by HIV and other enveloped viruses.

As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25–36 months, 37–48 months, 49–60 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, sex, and age × sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age × sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49–60 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1.00, and the angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles were sharp.

However, utilization of modified unstable antigens may be insufficient for potent T-cell cross-presentation by APCs, a mechanism that requires high levels of the antigenic protein. Therefore, we hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine utilizing a combination of proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions of an antigen in a prime/boost regimen may provide the most efficient CTL response. To address this hypothesis, we utilized conserved proteosome-resistant influenza A virus proteins M1 and NS1. Unstable versions of these polypeptides were constructed by destroying their 3-D structure via truncations or short insertions into predicted alpha-helical structures. These modified polypeptides were stabilized in the presence of the proteosome inhibitor MG132, strongly suggesting that they are degraded via a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Importantly, with both M1 and NS1antigens, homologous DNA vaccination with a mixture of unstable and proteosome-resistant wt forms of these proteins resulted in significantly higher CTL activity than vaccination with either wt or degradable forms. The most dramatic effect was seen with NS1, where homologous immunization with a mixture of these two forms was the only regimen that produced a notable elevation of CTL response, compared to vaccination with the wt NS1. Additionally, for M1 protein, heterologous vaccination utilizing the unstable form as prime and wild type form as boost, demonstrated significant augmentation of the CTL response. These data indicate that combining proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant forms of an antigen during vaccination is advantageous.","Therefore, we hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine utilizing a combination of proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions of an antigen in a prime/boost regimen may provide the most efficient CTL response.","['a_recombinant_vaccine', 'a_combination', 'proteosome-sensitive_and_proteosome-resistant_versions', 'an_antigen', 'a_prime/boost_regimen', 'the_most_efficient_CTL_response']","['a recombinant vaccine', 'a combination', 'proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions', 'an antigen', 'a prime/boost regimen', 'the most efficient CTL response']",a recombinant vaccine,a combination,proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions,an antigen,a prime/boost regimen,the most efficient CTL response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate potential changes in the oligomerization of virion-associated envelope proteins, we performed SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions but without thermal denaturation. This revealed the presence of SDS-resistant trimers of E1 in the context of cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc) as well as in the context of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). The formation of E1 trimers was found to depend on the coexpression of E2. To further understand the origin of E1 trimer formation, we coexpressed in bacteria the transmembrane (TM) domains of E1 (TME1) and E2 (TME2) fused to reporter proteins and analyzed the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As expected for strongly interacting TM domains, TME1–TME2 heterodimers resistant to SDS were observed. These analyses also revealed homodimers and homotrimers of TME1, indicating that such complexes are stable species. The N-terminal segment of TME1 exhibits a highly conserved GxxxG sequence, a motif that is well documented to be involved in intramembrane protein-protein interactions. Single or double mutations of the glycine residues (Gly354 and Gly358) in this motif markedly decreased or abrogated the formation of TME1 homotrimers in bacteria, as well as homotrimers of E1 in both HCVpp and HCVcc systems. A concomitant loss of infectivity was observed, indicating that the trimeric form of E1 is essential for virus infectivity. Taken together, these results indicate that E1E2 heterodimers form trimers on HCV particles, and they support the hypothesis that E1 could be a fusion protein. IMPORTANCE HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 play an essential role in virus entry into liver cells as well as in virion morphogenesis. In infected cells, these two proteins form a complex in which E2 interacts with cellular receptors, whereas the function of E1 remains poorly understood. However, recent structural data suggest that E1 could be the protein responsible for the process of fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Here we investigated the oligomeric state of HCV envelope glycoproteins. We demonstrate that E1 forms functional trimers after virion assembly and that in addition to the requirement for E2, a determinant for this oligomerization is present in a conserved GxxxG motif located within the E1 transmembrane domain. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement of E1E2 heterodimer complexes likely occurs during the assembly of HCV particles to yield a trimeric form of the E1E2 heterodimer. Gaining structural information on this trimer will be helpful for the design of an anti-HCV vaccine.","Taken together, these results indicate that E1E2 heterodimers form trimers on HCV particles, and they support the hypothesis that E1 could be a fusion protein.","['these_results', 'E1E2_heterodimers', 'trimers', 'HCV_particles', 'the_hypothesis', 'E1', 'a_fusion_protein']","['these results', 'E1E2 heterodimers', 'trimers', 'HCV particles', 'the hypothesis', 'E1', 'a fusion protein']",these results,E1E2 heterodimers,trimers,HCV particles,the hypothesis,E1,a fusion protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Prospective study of 890 ambulatory older persons without dementia who underwent annual clinical evaluations to examine change in the rate of mobility over time. RESULTS: In a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for age, sex, and education, mobility declined about 0.12 unit/year, and higher levels of respiratory muscle strength were associated with a slower rate of mobility decline (estimate 0.043, SE 0.012, p < 0.001). Respiratory muscle strength remained associated with the rate of change in mobility even after controlling for lower extremity strength (estimate 0.036, SE 0.012, p = 0.004). In a model that included terms for respiratory muscle strength, lower extremity strength and physical activity together, all three were independent predictors of mobility decline in older persons. These associations remained significant even after controlling for body composition, global cognition, the development of dementia, parkinsonian signs, possible pulmonary disease, smoking, joint pain and chronic diseases.

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that medical students receive insufficient training on correct methods for donning and doffing PPE. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students on clinical rotations at two teaching hospitals to determine the type of training they received in PPE technique. The students performed simulations of contaminated PPE removal with fluorescent lotion on gloves and were assessed for correct PPE technique and skin and/or clothing contamination. To obtain additional information on PPE training during medical education, residents, fellows, and attending physicians completed written questionnaires on PPE training received during medical school and on knowledge of PPE protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Of 27 medical students surveyed, only 11 (41%) reported receiving PPE training, and none had received training requiring demonstration of proficiency. During simulations, 25 of 27 (92.5%) students had one or more lapses in technique and 12 (44%) contaminated their skin with fluorescent lotion. For 100 residents, fellows and attending physicians representing 67 different medical schools, only 53% reported receiving training in use of PPE and only 39% selected correct donning and doffing sequence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need for development of effective strategies to train medical students in correct use of PPE.

Such episodes are termed acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The etiology of an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is induced by respiratory viral infections. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was tested for viral nucleic acid using polymerase chain reaction. Results Only 1 of the 14 patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia exhibited evidence of respiratory syncytial virus B, and 2 patients exhibited evidence of cytomegalovirus. Seven patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

The Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study is an observational cohort study designed to explore the role of the lung microbiome and genome in these two diseases. This article describes the design and rationale for the GRADS study sarcoidosis protocol. The study addresses the hypothesis that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription. The goal is to enroll 400 participants, with a minimum of 35 in each of 9 clinical phenotype subgroups prioritized by their clinical relevance to understanding of the pathobiology and clinical heterogeneity of sarcoidosis. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis undergo a baseline visit with self-administered questionnaires, chest computed tomography, pulmonary function tests, and blood and urine testing. A research or clinical bronchoscopy with a research bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed to obtain samples for genomic and microbiome analyses. Comparisons will be made by blood genomic analysis and with clinical phenotypic variables. A 6-month follow-up visit is planned to assess each participant’s clinical course. By the use of an integrative approach to the analysis of the microbiome and genome in selected clinical phenotypes, the GRADS study is powerfully positioned to inform and direct studies on the pathobiology of sarcoidosis, identify diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, and provide novel molecular phenotypes that could lead to improved personalized approaches to therapy for sarcoidosis.",The study addresses the hypothesis that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription.,"['The_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'distinct_patterns', 'sarcoidosis_phenotypes', 'changes', 'systemic_inflammatory_responses', 'peripheral_blood_changes', 'gene_transcription']","['The study', 'the hypothesis', 'distinct patterns', 'sarcoidosis phenotypes', 'changes', 'systemic inflammatory responses', 'peripheral blood changes', 'gene transcription']",The study,the hypothesis,distinct patterns,sarcoidosis phenotypes,changes,systemic inflammatory responses,peripheral blood changes,gene transcription,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of norovirus outbreaks are caused by genogroup II.4 (GII.4). Novel GII.4 strains emerge every 2 to 4 years and replace older variants as the dominant norovirus. Novel variants emerge through a combination of recombination, genetic drift, and selection driven by population immunity, but the exact mechanism of how or where is not known. We detected two previously unknown novel GII.4 variants, termed GII.4 UNK1 and GII.4 UNK2, and a diverse norovirus population in fecal specimens from immunocompromised individuals with diarrhea after they had undergone bone marrow transplantation. We hypothesized that immunocompromised individuals can serve as reservoirs for novel norovirus variants. To test our hypothesis, metagenomic analysis of viral RNA populations was combined with a full-genome bioinformatic analysis of publicly available GII.4 norovirus sequences from 1974 to 2014 to identify converging sites. Variable sites were proportionally more likely to be within two amino acids (P < 0.05) of positively selected sites. Further analysis using a hypergeometric distribution indicated that polymorphic site distribution was random and its proximity to positively selected sites was dependent on the size of the norovirus genome and the number of positively selected sites.In conclusion, random mutations may have a positive impact on driving norovirus evolution, and immunocompromised individuals could serve as potential reservoirs for novel GII.4 strains. IMPORTANCE Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in the United States. Every 2 to 3 years novel norovirus variants emerge and replace dominant strains. The continual emergence of novel noroviruses is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic drift, population immunity, and recombination, but exactly how this emergence occurs remains unknown. In this study, we identified two novel GII.4 variants in immunocompromised bone marrow transplant patients. Using metagenomic and bioinformatic analysis, we showed that most genetic polymorphisms in the novel variants occur near 0 to 2 amino acids of positively selected sites, but the distribution of mutations was random; clustering of polymorphisms with positively selected sites was a result of genome size and number of mutations and positively selected sites. This study shows that immunocompromised patients can harbor infectious novel norovirus variants, and although mutations in viruses are random, they can have a positive effect on viral evolution.",We hypothesized that immunocompromised individuals can serve as reservoirs for novel norovirus variants.,"['immunocompromised_individuals', 'reservoirs', 'novel_norovirus_variants']","['immunocompromised individuals', 'reservoirs', 'novel norovirus variants']",immunocompromised individuals,reservoirs,novel norovirus variants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
