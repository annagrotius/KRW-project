Hypothesis Generation Project
=============================
A knowledge graph tool that can aid a researcher in generating new hypothesis ideas from data related to coronavirus research.

## Introduction
This project is by Marta Turek, Anna de Groot, and Marcin Michorzewski and is for the course Knowledge Representation on the Web at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, taught by Ilaria Tiddi and Albert Moreno. The work in this project develops a hypothesis ontology that is used to build a knowledge graph with sources on the web. A Web API application is built around a use case that demonstrates the ontology model. Our research question investigates how the knowledge graph can aid a researcher towards generating new hypothesis ideas.
