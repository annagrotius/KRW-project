One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity. To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of AMD or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce low-level inflammation. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities as well as increased total bile acid concentrations in serum and midzonal hepatocellular necrosis were observed only in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats. The time interval between AMD and LPS administration was critical: AMD injected 16 h before LPS led to liver injury, whereas AMD injected 2–12 h before LPS failed to cause this response. The increase in ALT activity in AMD/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with AMD as well as LPS. The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of AMD were not affected by LPS coexposure. Serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was significantly increased by LPS and was slightly prolonged by AMD. In Hepac1c7 cells, addition of TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and its primary metabolite, mono-N-desethylamiodarone. In vivo inhibition of TNF signaling by etanercept attenuated the AMD/LPS-induced liver injury in rats. In summary, AMD treatment during modest inflammation induced severe hepatotoxicity in rats, and TNF contributed to the induction of liver injury in this animal model of idiosyncratic AMD-induced liver injury.",""

However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015–2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00ffa3530324046dc0a390400a4d1fe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cce1c9e3b81c4d14e53f9d39b5afce0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0edba78b832cc842058db8be733bbae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f2ba7aa9687b604017b3077a63a1390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f9289f380d9b7625dfe08632e6c78d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11defaa04d07acfaedb1b7b374556f2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29b0bc428a1572c3f5b1bce46d97f5f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c73b8c78ff1798744702ee0c4dea8f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b0370fd1eb10f3b9b6bce41ad62c40d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e988d5453230c7a15e9d8210afd12b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a61fa77ee64d16ec7bd72f11d288215, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b0683ba0b6ea8789d630144ce5dc7c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f7e7edfee26912438b0d05612c6a02f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b90195f640e82c7e0fa89431c031659, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f095ba567c21e69ece6ad993caf87a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/616f4a6352fd462a59c0dd0fac7e5844, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69a10187a59f3a73a71eaad669eff264, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c38de8779aeef8d7aff921ad004066c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72d6beef20b9d98eb20859fc90783f59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d8cbff257092e1b02aa8f0fb2120289, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8918870b43bc88716304fab3de99c44d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9251941d3392b045c65235e849f9d5a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/990588aa75bcb154f51f7162e0f541b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c309018c5e741493ea599829f35685f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a93e1eae2b8bf13d0c91e04346f926dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa7c3a13adab4a37b71d8c4a723d636f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc8e92a056e81ecbebe8f88d925500cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1f33d29c3cf921acddc8b9c41d26203, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2785c44fcd4a6f2e6471b6433a37f7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2b88e048cbc64b78a52d5956c7012cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3447d5328d7b9958c13eff3ae94250a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3e0a5a2925ff2392b745016ed8115b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4b49faa5fe7384a8ca80d941042daf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5c94424a544e3bf2a7c9afdef4e1a60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8ab21058902218d4f916c2f6edd0e48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5e15702543e0ab77fa609e762bcd8b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e957429ec325212f9b25038d0397f042, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb7aef7cb88468cd84ff5103a45c55da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f35b21771f927fca01d5c9e34c89ef9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f9c5891812b400e51130912fbc59d2"

Cell lysis occurred 24 h post-infection and was shown by a decreased neutral red uptake. UV inactivation of the influenza virus, or the addition of anti-influenza antibodies suppressed the virus-induced macrophage lysis. Inversely, pretreatment of swine alveolar macrophages by a phagocytosis inhibitor, namely cytochalasin B, increased the cell susceptibility to virus-induced lysis. The present in vitro studies support the hypothesis that defects in pulmonary antibacterial mechanisms associated with influenza infections are partly due to a direct toxic effect of the virus on alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, the studies show that virus-induced macrophage lysis is influenced by specific humoral immune responses and by modifications in microfilament cell functions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3576b70c2ff9fc3bf49947811752a42c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52ddc6c75d028bc171043fba29456af6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/731f4c6eb2d7a2f8389a5129a28f5c58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c569a451b465c4741a0ce0f74b20d91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c0566bf1f2308213d4d6f0a23cf70d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f72a0994c13d2756c0b87c61b655c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a75ea4f0dc7e14ef4f25238bd9a9d036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7f79c70ee4628b4e84efd073e283fb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1210295fc2d9d57b77872c08c245c24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b43f5e5332997958fd6aec024379d01c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3e4a94dca16bba1ab6f8c1d1888e873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c804f9ed7a5b0898bcd866ffd8f46da5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9c57a1f40b736122c90d15170a2ddf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da7ef07c45b2aa3f078454e335f167da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dab70237cd64fd3605097c82f0029660, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e28289cb7a87980b8badfd73344136e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e54e8eb860490183778d94fef4d29969, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea9846c445804a32b30e769afaba07cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f67811088f5414a12606a903fe72a91f"

This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of cross-protective antibodies acquired by older individuals during previous exposures to H1N1 viruses. However, this hypothesis could not be empirically tested. To address this question, we compared viral replication and the development of the immune response in naïve young adult and aged female rhesus macaques infected with A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (CA04) virus. We show higher viral loads in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal and ocular swabs in aged animals, suggesting increased viral replication in both the lower and upper respiratory tracts. T cell proliferation was higher in the BAL fluid but delayed and reduced in peripheral blood in aged animals. This delay in proliferation correlated with a reduced frequency of effector CD4 T cells in old animals. Aged animals also mobilized inflammatory cytokines to higher levels in the BAL fluid. Finally, we compared changes in gene expression using microarray analysis of BAL fluid samples. Our analyses revealed that the largest difference in host response between aged and young adult animals was detected at day 4 postinfection, with a significantly higher induction of genes associated with inflammation and the innate immune response in aged animals. Overall, our data suggest that, in the absence of preexisting antibodies, CA04 infection in aged macaques is associated with changes in innate and adaptive immune responses that were shown to correlate with increased disease severity in other respiratory disease models.",""

During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spread—linear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms. Although this study did not provide a definitive assessment of airborne spread of PEDv, we believe the findings justify additional research to investigate this potential mechanism of transmission.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0034d36af590f9595bc837f42f070e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f786a9ea6db9082a406bdeb72e94caf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5058513a7a51712b4a2e18885d1e7e51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57fbdeaf30751ca5938aebbd7bd05601, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/864759da21fd9241cfe8b319c9ef21f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eac173a6cc852f6b1fe0e3dbacc2b29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c40bb12b67078f52fa1fe667cc17287d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d761cd7be443f16f7682bde260676b84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e13e58200fcdc8a8eb14d6435f110ad4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4b1851c9d8ff7b96a5a9945c77de8e2"

Trophoblasts produce numerous immunomodulators that play a role in placental development and pregnancy maintenance. We hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise pregnancy. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the expression of representative pro-(TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, and GM-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); CD134, a secondary co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells (FIV primary receptor); the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (FIV co-receptor); SDF-1α, the chemokine ligand to CXCR4; and FIV gag in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. METHODS: We used an anti-cytokeratin antibody in immunohistochemistry to identify trophoblasts selectively, collected these cells using laser capture microdissection, and extracted total RNA from the captured cell populations. Real time, reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify gene expression. RESULTS: We detected IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and CXCR4 in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. Expression of cytokines increased from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. A clear, pro-inflammatory microenvironment was not evident in trophoblasts from FIV-infected queens at either stage of pregnancy. Reproductive failure was accompanied by down-regulation of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. CD134 was not detected in trophoblasts, and FIV gag was detected in only one of ten trophoblast specimens collected from FIV-infected queens. CONCLUSION: Feline trophoblasts express an array of pro-and anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increases from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. Non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. The detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare, suggesting that the high rate of reproductive failure in FIV-infected queens was not a direct result of viral replication in trophoblasts. The influence of placental immune cells on trophoblast function and pregnancy maintenance in the FIV-infected cat requires additional study.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0034446ad90c818268a04ecedf621d21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00871425f497257e35eb3b6cb124d138, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01d1b67f4cf69d82166e952609bff7b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/061b2df0b3bb94c9753f36a9a73734cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f74faa09ee0c9233d9c12b478a86f4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b70ec29cd3593c1fd119b05e88d79d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26402c886a9c71d0145d44111b2a6208, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a75fbb85ebdcd7ac3679c6ef1a46b53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30ea1df6412a0db9cf7d73b80b30d69d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30f1b6cf44b7a0ff5e81f219db771b60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/333a8a552597d653905a9e61b47de884, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34d718eac3d811b12e94d48a219fbefb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41efc22f4985ec63694c33e62c5febbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4458b2bebb0765dfe8f8a1f0b0f0e9bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c9fe2d83059fdc1537881c19aaf4149, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ede7c633cd02adc9da1628357d276c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d3bc69c55de1bd3220a3c70ddce8069, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/629f3670c8215102dd6bb11d2fa6a860, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/676560610219e195d0d776d8a48440cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/682e0e7c5d65df7c9878a234e257e803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f3a9135530ae7361de09e2d2b6c37a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7189e9e263a2243ea56307f168feba82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75214fe1c43f273118c16ebacb6ad376, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a028ed8fa26f5987477fee518692a28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd4d233d9a9d2b5bd8e19b9a8c86967, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96c0f4c584432d60e4197bc9bf28a9ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fcced2f6658206c0361bd1280715f4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a069f8af5096545e09b17136b760954b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0c4e17efba1475d5c3f7c17cd17db58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0ec3573388f888728558ecc8082a551, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b12d6fe4e5d26c17761ce93b088246bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1fee0079db5393853c60fa94430b17b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baef14ede6ea4630a580a790130c8604, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbbb6fe5f42694434c095f43be21baa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf63f9c5afad1a718dbf3778e87d2f10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d61a5e2f2a73009de4f0e6a2740cdb8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7a1eed340b8bddca6f36a0ccf77a958, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da21abdd0321d6ce97d871eab53bb5c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8de6145c991a9038ff9c635b97b673b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e927964afdfe8e613b912dd1316908e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9f1c8dc93a06d8fdb1cc540fd3af73d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb8996fcdc7bcda620584f7f5e7c5149"

To address this question, we analyzed the frameshifting sequence elements from animal or plant virus in yeast and Escherichia coli. Frameshifting efficiencies varied in yeast, but not in E. coli, depending on the specific conformation of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) RNA pseudoknot. Similar changes in frameshifting efficiencies were observed in yeast, but not in E. coli, for the mutations in frameshifting sequence elements from cereal yellow dwarf virus serotype RPV (CYDV-RPV). The differential response of MMTV or CYDV-RPV frameshifting signal to prokaryotic and eukaryotic translational machineries implies that ribosome pausing alone is insufficient to mediate frameshifting, and additional events including specific interaction between ribosome and RNA structural element are required for efficient frameshifting. These results supports the hypothesis that frameshifting occurs by a specific interaction between ribosome and frameshifting signal.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ea3c32afcbd0820e9cdd0cd315704fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17db6bfd8f74b2ed642916edd7575b7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3620c09d24c159b3673795f3f1f201dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3de8cce73a982e6fd210b26bbd9ce401, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48ce95d92887e2bb58a34b842fc70e3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a46331fd5bccde926e94b5a3d2db21b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d43d29fbf447c6a82d97bef1180f556, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d9ea6844bbc65521c4fb1f79fbe7ab4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51bb407b1875bfc7da0a144c5d164d28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51c995a0f2ac82079df793cfa193dfb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54434d9a1d2d34639062abef41e7de8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/592fbc5662248ea682d58c643d880331, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e28a73e7d5cd5921bac046955d3dbd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60ed98ce43269e0bb8de796a5e202f90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/654d5848c5f0ea05f8f9749d1ac4de8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6aeccf681dcec792b047105d32f06a9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b05168401549bddf83472fea74fd86a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c06dd89eca3119a1ec62804b5c0357f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/702663606b388c601433bd859acb5d4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81729b4f0c57648bba494a5d836ebc30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81c6dc1a2106d931e0ec8b0373f387c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89ef4564d9dcf4ae7bc652dcf1832e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d1b98a0498d21e93c0e7225d4327ba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fbce63b5a7eeee602f0b975c884a82e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91de39afe621beab686cdea9144310ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97e2de18aff0dd493df66acb413a8a85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d2264665c3a5abb6c1d0ce4023b6d6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae87ae4f789f07d1b2f1222287ffda84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d34e7383f703120efcd2acc27cf564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd8d2db4d573d62031c19e3997443d01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce6d3d6e1e53780a924ffc3589e1bcfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf65fbab7953a2c96d8e58631323a8e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5e27d28dcc1bb898fe6f346f1127a1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dca24b406d8e9be49f112932c76eb9c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5811be638f3810957b0082e22fa883a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa369b261dec88c9b98fd1edb9483866, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc40d2fc06e388be6eac64eef1547571"

Methods A join-count spatial statistic study was conducted and the given hypothetical processes of the spread of SARS in Beijing were tested using various definitions of ‘joins’. Results The spatial statistics showed that of the six diffusion processes, the highest negative autocorrelation occurred in the doctor-number model (M-5) and the lowest negative autocorrelation was found in the population-amount model (M-3). The results also showed that in the whole 29-day research period, about hour or more days experienced a significant degree of contagion. Conclusions Spatial analysis is helpful in understanding the spatial diffusion process of an epidemic. The geographical relationships were important during the early phase of the SARS epidemic in Beijing. The statistic based on the number of doctors was significant and more informative than that of the number of hospitals. It reveals that doctors were important in the spread of SARS in Beijing, and hospitals were not as important as doctors in the contagion period. People are the key to the spread of SARS, but the population density was more significant than the population size, although they were both important throughout the whole period.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1683bd58412736d01679ea94d32c2d83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22aadf873ffc07a7ca33a8c7e1fccec9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22cb677420383b9f546a4216f6813409, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26a5302dc6e80acb6d46c3cdae485789, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ddf6b49a633853f7f621fd45a566d7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34a0af56e6205b8c8c996718d9d354b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4623143917cca1f847bf2eb7b552fc72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49453d06735a5f3c687455f7bee36939, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52929eccd7e8aaaacf465359f22a2812, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56e59c5b4f967cd7254b3d6c3b3953d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68b31ab665326fd0ce37823994215882, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dc5fb20f815f94763c3681870a69326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8de71db6555e8386b064b2e765abcadc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9efa76ef801fc8300ca4a031fd513961, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7fe8073baab46ff56c150b5e72c1f0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa666ec2481dd904e12333e53573e405, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b19edc16a934826bc9099ba08dc2040d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5912508f5029742a663dd66d58977db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d24af50557218d6c0b8b50cc536c2471, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfc9aa762dcb1a8c7694354b76071939, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef70415baa19b35777edc2f4c9ee06ec"

As a first line of defense against respiratory infections, innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), play an important role. Upon infection with RSV, multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize RSV-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount innate immune responses. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) have been identified as important innate receptors to mount type I IFNs during RSV infection. However, type I IFN levels remain surprisingly low during RSV infection despite strong viral replication. The poor induction of type I IFNs can be attributed to the cooperative activity of 2 unique, nonstructural (NS) proteins of RSV, i.e., NS1 and NS2. These viral proteins have been shown to suppress both the production and signaling of type I and III IFNs by counteracting a plethora of key host innate signaling proteins. Moreover, increasing numbers of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are being identified as targets of the NS proteins in recent years, highlighting an underexplored protein family in the identification of NS target proteins. To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NS1 was resolved recently and, remarkably, identified NS1 as a structural paralogue of the RSV matrix protein. Unfortunately, no structural data on NS2 have been published so far. In this review, we briefly describe the PRRs that mount innate immune responses upon RSV infection and provide an overview of the various effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, we discuss the ubiquitination effector functions of NS1 and NS2, which are in line with the hypothesis that the NSD shares features with the canonical 26S proteasome.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00b5a71eb9f414bb1616513e5b213e0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03580c99553e4aeec255d7edfdab0a67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09cc7fa9ad81697a592a24207766c2a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d703c8c9e769f588b147af7e41a02c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e551cd34882cd4ac5a6b2a5f526216f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e773b6e636d6ad6bab52ff063a5b525, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dc1b97087c8826d6e264169fe86c9e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1efe7c80093e24962ce019c1ac2ff924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f1ac9652066d89da113efd4b3dd9809, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30d6075bd34865d153b5355f8f6a9e9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3570965e72b132423fb7bfc326f8f81c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/397e1fbd2e787a1e0571b610ab0de541, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c97d3642c360d19bb93057c8b07efab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/568ab44adc61f5849aaf04c69d49b9fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/569712d4ea2179681d8f4eab8a3c6f1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5995c343e5710672a5661ce38f339163, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a0d7d5f954e9078e9a25fe0a6ec4ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c49985ceb481af87057c6ad3481b81a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c6aef1da5f54112df87798f7c99d0ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5faab29f8b9bd1a512340287369b981e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/636427cf62d8fbbb9532f69278340061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/691e69b716d671867dc9def9b8883040, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a6e4e674ab726e4192be8e7fc3d1f97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a8b16eb38c4626e4e45197418ca8afc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bded1f2fd47a3288008cbd461755665, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e3c85756ccb78163e25233472a92c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92c660a43fe97cca9b49f156dc11ac63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/947e35198c2e9295dbebb0ca3f148b79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94884b730010dbb75a2cbc59f116dacf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a24fef1b357e05855bef33477d6d4679, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a86b0e683840309538845dde992d1d79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abd255c37ec1595d71266300554123d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeaca8c4fa336237eec9318dee39542f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0b3916754593d93530878f46cb3320c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b12c48c66af50408dc9913de2583b9ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bab100f600563ba4ba6b5a356dda6687, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcd6c0419c209c0a9c3d8357c47653cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c58a3bd95ca1061413e86faf0cb9dbcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c73f71580e51f585f1feb6ba72f18715, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c75efd7668a5fe02ec021b9117bc9f63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8423204bccaa9667870acebdd893ff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c84702a88ff43502a64128a12f50c4cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9f15c7ec779a3be4e769dc2ab2612c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d680a050a15fe8679fb091a6ce60329c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc9b0ee9c5a8823e1ad078d8d9880053, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dccd93e14d5a715bf65bbbb6f556c888, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de4f9b35f764170abdee1c7c90e5dfb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0b682861093956d6aa859987dead62b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e379d81d72bb7b4bc6619adabe206b79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3f101599ef9911c282773e7ee1092b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e68511af9635cdec38e86c15ac8aeef0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb0c082a4745555851ec1434f06170d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec66a23f5d93eb8c463aa87ae1b99019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee6da4ee31cb9844a6447238999defd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7e229e8635c58692ea0d22c1b793e63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8b396043537a6ee4a6bc8d9baeb65e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb5311a1da6ff8185887ee4a6ab25dad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbca30b890b1adc217d48d3a36698cea"

This network is thought to accommodate the viral replication machinery and protect it from innate immune detection. We hypothesized that the innate immune response has tools to counteract the formation of these virus-induced replication organelles in order to inhibit virus replication. Here we have investigated the effect of type I interferon (IFN) treatment on the formation of arterivirus-induced membrane structures. Our approach involved ectopic expression of arterivirus nonstructural proteins nsp2 and nsp3, which induce DMV formation in the absence of other viral triggers of the interferon response, such as replicating viral RNA. Thus, this setup can be used to identify immune effectors that specifically target the (formation of) virus-induced membrane structures. Using large-scale electron microscopy mosaic maps, we found that IFN-β treatment significantly reduced the formation of the membrane structures. Strikingly, we also observed abundant stretches of double-membrane sheets (a proposed intermediate of DMV formation) in IFN-β-treated samples, suggesting the disruption of DMV biogenesis. Three interferon-stimulated gene products, two of which have been reported to target the hepatitis C virus replication structures, were tested for their possible involvement, but none of them affected membrane structure formation. Our study reveals the existence of a previously unknown innate immune mechanism that antagonizes the viral hijacking of host membranes. It also provides a solid basis for further research into the poorly understood interactions between the innate immune system and virus-induced replication structures.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b02ba4c406a7608e5d9b4f8cb6b7a9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/108f87e6202d15e2bdc55701cacfbf0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1accfcc40f5560496013be19d240bfa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25785c471f10b657ba60f1006208662c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f59d9c08299da308dfa6ada65d3dde8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31ead599adce89a44f5525d98943c8b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33bc8bb7ed9a38d344e47071b9f04670, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34de28f2d63367aaacbcb23b7d0e90c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/380ad26eed9fc6715acb257f729351f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4952f5d7f791ffff7e9998f24ecf6b6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/508cb4a7f30c8b150dceddb81233cca1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/532547d77e0fe752b424e2d06df73662, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6659cbb1224d71666207b70c325917c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a1b05965a01a276cd9d2278228aa7b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ca4e20fbbe490f9ff615d477b4b3283, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7da2f39a419e20846bb53688da6b0da9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80e02af9981f2deaba947358bdfa6d99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/843b7fb250beb275d8631b0b2f72e128, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a7066757dc418a9145cb529c5a03b38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0191e275cda63a76c7791e37e52cb7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b12de3e617593e7795d69f964079d026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b48f0652cee0fea58784d744a3ed7e8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9da881fa67d0c285628ac6304010683, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9c7947e08bda8b351b0cfe2fde36bd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc08581160e5f7501d76aca3fc64aafd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0d0ae51143e1d3a75af25f95c8bf2dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e301cfb222c7b66d084554f88467fade, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb9d61ba160235b8cf8a5d0baded0527, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec853536a41add3c415fb87a6cdf388a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc722e06ca88586bb1a77e5a63c168bc"

Similar to other class I viral fusion glycoproteins, the F protein has two heptad repeat regions (HRA and HRB) that are important in membrane fusion and can be targeted by antiviral inhibitors. Upon activation of the F protein, HRA refolds from a spring-loaded, crumpled structure into a coiled coil that inserts a hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target membrane and binds to the HRB helices to form a fusogenic hairpin. To investigate how F protein conformational changes are regulated, we mutated in the Sendai virus F protein a highly conserved 10-residue sequence in HRA that undergoes major structural changes during protein refolding. Nine of the 15 mutations studied caused significant defects in F protein expression, processing, and fusogenicity. Conversely, the remaining six mutations enhanced the fusogenicity of the F protein, most likely by helping spring the HRA coil. Two of the residues that were neither located at “a” or “d” positions in the heptad repeat nor conserved among the paramyxoviruses were key regulators of the folding and fusion activity of the F protein, showing that residues not expected to be important in coiled-coil formation may play important roles in regulating membrane fusion. Overall, the data support the hypothesis that regions in the F protein that undergo dramatic changes in secondary and tertiary structure between the prefusion and hairpin conformations regulate F protein expression and activation.",""

Reflecting their importance for host defense, pathogens encode various countermeasures to evade or inhibit these immune effectors. PRRs directly engaged by pathogen inhibitors often evolve under recurrent bouts of positive selection that have been described as molecular ‘arms races.’ Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) was recently identified as a key PRR. Upon binding cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various viruses, cGAS generates the small nucleotide secondary messenger cGAMP to signal activation of innate defenses. Here we report an evolutionary history of cGAS with recurrent positive selection in the primate lineage. Recent studies indicate a high degree of structural similarity between cGAS and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), a PRR that detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), despite low sequence identity between the respective genes. We present comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS1 primate sequences and observe positive selection at nucleic acid binding interfaces and distributed throughout both genes. Our data revealed homologous regions with strong signatures of positive selection, suggesting common mechanisms employed by unknown pathogen encoded inhibitors and similar modes of evasion from antagonism. Our analysis of cGAS diversification also identified alternately spliced forms missing multiple sites under positive selection. Further analysis of selection on the OAS family in primates, which comprises OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL, suggests a hypothesis where gene duplications and domain fusion events result in paralogs that provide another means of escaping pathogen inhibitors. Together our comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS provides new insights into distinct mechanisms by which key molecular sentinels of the innate immune system have adapted to circumvent viral-encoded inhibitors.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0363edfe7fb2ddd8db053a4a573f3464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05bfe2002c3a8e7ca74f6104c53da6d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a6d67df7734ba418a3f6b71c3adeefb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f5ee74d004d5a33ed601e7add61aee1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15b590090ac898fc00c8d0c1da7ffa33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bf81d2b78a93877c3b0b60ed81bdddd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1db04d0de8cb50e6fe7474043bc95df2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25b1259da14ad422a040ac1cfa71b3e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b509c20fc670d4fba4bdf105ea71c2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c7150b26ab7def91229f927865220c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d8b82df4385fa44aacdc086ff548227, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36ea50240917c958616bca90c661dbe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f042ebfb6fea855cf409bf931e7f97d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f5b218333a3bd4c1478560c916c4fbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41602ad1907ded00a1f0b740ce05f2c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41fb54d7dc0f9f1908b8532f581ce6c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4668dfa0aece729c68c32e666bf31b3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46914a1984111b1c6f4b20347a19a966, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47d5a475de81aed1d42cadcfd476295c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/496fd8e17d541fa2564953ba025aeae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53ce83305204436dccbbf4eacc6023fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/602949120a8ec4f796bce9930ba4308a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60719f72c835c62f631e65cb0599ac3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61894a962e4a732a114e61b0ca3e8a8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6323ebeed193d3ccf50865da8ba5cc1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66dc9f8df841f8b0dfb4c347396a2fae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69cadd27984c2fc46bbfe1e795c06323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a9afabc2ef4fe3b2ec397fbda880650, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7370949a654325d4d22170c332fe8042, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ca2d2991ff31babc66d61c4f65c19d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f8b59b05aee6bbae112cdf0b6e471a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f92ee3e6c1f7a9e200a63ca64d5f8f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80e153bfce1591bc0777c684172172c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/842428834e8068f6aaf9ec0c8f7eb70d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a1c81792174477f2fd6c26481157695, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92219f0d99ebd231ae2e6cd54cfd15f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96557ed50652ae9a4f787f93276f20f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a1d1de6d4c6c66be70d990c5c8c4fc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a41c160201bdea8f6eecb19f1c77e7d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad1fa9725cbecff9cac1049a0d222ef2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3cdaf43dfa5b6f15d275427a2260851, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ef6c36a37a04346b12e808a212e652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5bc720f80eca06011616248577c5f14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd842270f143fb73ef7139ac46301a8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdef03ca7337bfbffc13ab69a50811d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2264be77b2f8a0d65495b428409bfb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d476dd4d4ecce244336740973a63ae31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7fc766da36dfca6712678ae82d344a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d974bddc48f8a5aafc190256bc19c4f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e222f3e51d91c7d49bace70998fca2ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5da587979f2e59be287d559c05edb78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e80fcd917028e594bfd45a59b1eeb091, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8f5f49fcddc5f255d7dd3945d41064a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f074ee48f4a1cd91b34057124028b115, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f21dc78c480656590d8be97f503034bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9b5309d6ba34c8de76ab9d0b45fb490"

Here, random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling of the single-chain variable fragment of the neutralizing antibody 80R followed by bacterial display screening using anchored periplasmic expression (APEx) were used to generate a number of higher-affinity variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-neutralizing antibody 80R with equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) as low as 37 pM, a >270-fold improvement relative to that of the parental 80R single-chain variable fragment (scFv). As expected, antigen affinity was shown to correlate directly with neutralization potency toward the icUrbani strain of SARS-CoV. Additionally, the highest-affinity antibody fragment displayed 10-fold-increased broad neutralization in vitro and completely protected against several SARS-CoV strains containing substitutions associated with antibody escape. Importantly, higher affinity also led to the suppression of viral escape mutants in vitro. Escape from the highest-affinity variant required reduced selective pressure and multiple substitutions in the binding epitope. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that engineered antibodies with picomolar dissociation constants for a neutralizing epitope can confer escape-resistant protection.",""

Previous studies have shown significant variation in the incidence of viral, bacterial and mixed infections, with conflicting risk associations for mortality. We aimed to determine the risk association of microbial aetiologies with hospital mortality in severe CAP, utilising a diagnostic strategy incorporating molecular testing. Our primary hypothesis was that respiratory viruses were important causative pathogens in severe CAP and was associated with increased mortality when present with bacterial pathogens in mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2014 to July 2015 was conducted in a tertiary hospital medical intensive care unit in eastern Singapore, which has a tropical climate. All patients diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia were included. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were in the study. Microbial pathogens were identified in 84 (71.8%) patients. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections occurred in 18 (15.4%) of patients. Isolated viral infections were present in 32 patients (27.4%); isolated bacterial infections were detected in 34 patients (29.1%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (13.7%) patients. The most common bacteria isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae and the most common virus isolated was Influenza A. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that serum procalcitonin, APACHE II severity score and mixed viral-bacterial infection were associated with increased risk of hospital mortality. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% CI 1.30–151.05, p = 0.03) for hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are common organisms isolated in severe community-acquired pneumonia. Mixed viral-bacterial infections may be associated with an increased risk of mortality.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08d85cb6da51d1addd4dde8ed75ef918, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19af283f730ec633d2a5ccbf822e7a5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1df3d5a4b6b6281787babb859994c240, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2259d68187daf706aca64ce4cea09b30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28d3146419d50ee65e56f07f714ce6b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dbeaf1416fde103bcd02fd23f73b06d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31d3e630cbf62b689d97bc79464ec66c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/372613be764cc3d8ee3f150456f85938, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3735d3d06df2b402eeb521d8315b0fd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3902244ff2fbbe4ebc11a1e5d39cea16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c691a943c239b5464fba328d9ccd8b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51165d2f41d0554508d744d6d6d778c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56b875221def96bde4335c76f1a6da36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57136911760971c2d0d261b5708b9f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b6a79c0adb033d2fd6a687b3fa59e75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/605a662de3d2b6c5f837b35a0867f050, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/683d1cbc427c0bec2604c1666a76db62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79f617cfaa2a1132bf26a86193dc8ae5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d506558e297c60640cc71f8caf6b3e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82d9fb15a27afd2aa64c19b3fee4bb31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83c652e92a0e30643a27e1c5a9e16cbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/897c03f517a1a3b7fb68b7eef0ec2941, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/987aec1e22798c35169278a242aab659, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9883f440d7bb2f377b61bfb704b13c91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a713f576a973262674e1c3f3e0ab39fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa66f7e0236a235a49496337cab7b708, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6e80d5e7ccc2150e074310303b55b82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c726684431e0ec35738ad133309bccdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9885da1fa233d4ad521cbb8953b42d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cceae5a95bd3d72b0dbf94b16fa724db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1471639e64c73fc6e91fedbd79c761b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd978ea25214a19114cc255de921fa0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea6649af6acf4f8902061384aac2aaf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6c0645ee0a642b01285e3d8c48ad85a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f85f6bc21fcf7f02db478876069d1566, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fccbd6d84f085f40bfcd0f8214fc3de8"

Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to naïve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. METHODS: A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four naïve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two naïve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. RESULTS: The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a study of children <24 months old presenting to the emergency department with bronchiolitis. Demographic, clinical information, nasal-wash (NW) and serum specimens were obtained. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7 activity and a panel of cytokines and chemokines. Total LDH activity was tested in NW samples and sera. RESULTS: Of 101 enrolled children (median age, 5.6 months), 98 had NW specimens available. A viral etiology was found in 82 patients (83.6%), with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (66%) and rhinovirus (19%) being the most common viruses detected. Concentrations of LDH in NW specimens were independent from those in sera, and were higher in children with RSV infection or with dual infection. Significant correlations were found between NW LDH and NW cytokines/chemokines. Similarly, NW LDH correlated with NW-caspase 3/7 activity (r=0.75; P<.001). In a multivariate analysis, NW LDH concentration in the upper quartile was significantly associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization (odds ratio: 0.19; 95% confidence interval: 0.05–0.68; P=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: NW LDH levels in young children with bronchiolitis varied according to viral etiology and disease severity. Values in the upper quartile were associated with ~80% risk reduction in hospitalization, likely reflecting a robust antiviral response. NW LDH may be a useful biomarker to assist the clinician in the decision to hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ca287bfe614682644adb3091cbc711c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/400ebd6e41fffad8b55bbf880335b0fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/506eda0f710e68c5b08377f523da1398, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63b71b4d0a28478868c65a1eb2c5c97f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/795d75ca21a7f91da18bcd7d6d2b86d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb3bdf157462fbe4b0a058fbe39263df"

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0542792b8eecb4184440057b54b2e831, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/064147e675c4cff323c40f395b7d4b0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e1ca759b0e548a9ddc2f4792c1bb50e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1545a10a5ef22653f8b60490bc813f2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/163695cbe34ee3b312730f0826342034, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17ef7a4fba13bd13b48792929b5525a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27f2d858513e6ec23a3dcba259bf5da2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36b78468708341a9a3ba8ef41ed7f3ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a32fdbf13d42db4993d4342fe9c45b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41d8fd6f05e52b10dcf503ef32be72db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f244cb574b8b78730f6e91cbf378ba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55e50eb71a652b97f5c970c5d3b31c72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b9757166631bc453a5a25f7748800f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7567f813bc059c0c6b7869f67e832670, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/756edc2bf2c531e5e5688fc7c8dd7d96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bc52170166302845fcee586db38db2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92c0c9a53e10696951a378f0e9564484, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c9e184969bd3d7f00ea8732d41ceb85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7111adc10190251d44d1a92d56deb01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cee7e9d601f76d86e1227d1903eef75f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecef1b1acf2faeaa9196c37ed0ce0380, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ede3400693a4f1c5014f26a773aaf1c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f49d80c9984f73f5270fa7c3deea1fdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff2847574d72381b9db9017c66a3e6dc"

Mutant viruses isolated from infected glial cultures 16 to 18 weeks postinfection replicate with kinetics similar to those of wild-type virus but produce small plaques on fibroblasts and cause only minimal levels of cell-to-cell fusion under conditions in which wild type causes nearly complete cell fusion. However, since extensive fusion is present in mutant-infected cells at late times postinfection, the defect is actually a delay in kinetics rather than an absolute block in activity. Addition of trypsin to mutant-infected fibroblast cultures enhanced cell fusion a small (two- to fivefold) but significant degree, indicating that the defect could be due to a lack of cleavage of the viral spike (fusion) protein. Sequencing of portions of the spike genes of six fusion-defective mutants revealed that all contained the same single nucleotide mutation resulting in a substitution of aspartic acid for histidine in the spike cleavage signal. Mutant virions contained only the 180-kDa form of spike protein, suggesting that this mutation prevented the normal proteolytic cleavage of the 180-kDa protein into the 90-kDa subunits. Examination of revertants of the mutants supports this hypothesis. Acquisition of fusion competence correlates with the replacement of the negatively charged aspartic acid with either the wild-type histidine or a nonpolar amino acid and the restoration of spike protein cleavage. These data confirm and extend previous reports concluding cleavage of S is required for efficient cell-cell fusion by mouse hepatitis virus but not for virus-cell fusion (infectivity).",""

We addressed the hypothesis that antigenic drift is involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SSPE by analyzing antigenic alterations in the MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein (MeV-H) found in patients with SSPE in relation to major circulating MeV genotypes. To this aim, we obtained cDNA for the MeV-H gene from tissue taken at brain autopsy from 3 deceased persons with SSPE who had short (3–4 months, SMa79), average (3.5 years, SMa84), and long (18 years, SMa94) disease courses. Recombinant MeVs with a substituted MeV-H gene were generated by a reverse genetic system. Virus neutralization assays with a panel of anti-MeV-H murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or vaccine-immunized mouse anti-MeV-H polyclonal sera were performed to determine the antigenic relatedness. Functional and receptor-binding analysis of the SSPE MeV-H showed activity in a SLAM/nectin-4–dependent manner. Similar to our panel of wild-type viruses, our SSPE viruses showed an altered antigenic profile. Genotypes A, G3, and F (SSPE case SMa79) were the exception, with an intact antigenic structure. Genotypes D7 and F (SSPE SMa79) showed enhanced neutralization by mAbs targeting antigenic site IIa. Genotypes H1 and the recently reported D4.2 were the most antigenically altered genotypes. Epitope mapping of neutralizing mAbs BH015 and BH130 reveal a new antigenic site on MeV-H, which we designated Φ for its intermediate position between previously defined antigenic sites Ia and Ib. We conclude that SSPE-causing viruses show similar antigenic properties to currently circulating MeV genotypes. The absence of a direct correlation between antigenic changes and predisposition of a certain genotype to cause SSPE does not lend support to the proposed antigenic drift as a pathogenetic mechanism in SSPE.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03e36a4e776ed6bbf34045ae5f9e663a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04f3a75a153ff6a02e5f6ac7207c89d8,

This initial attachment is of a multivalent nature, i.e., it requires the establishment of multiple bonds between amino acids of viral glycoproteins and sulfated saccharides on the GAG chain. To gain understanding of how this binding process is modulated, we performed binding kinetics and mobility studies using end-grafted GAG chains that mimic the end attachment of these chains to proteoglycans. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to probe binding and release, as well as the diffusion of single HSV-1 particles. To verify the hypothesis that the degree of sulfation, but also the arrangement of sulfate groups along the GAG chain, plays a key role in HSV binding, we tested two native GAGs (chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) and compared our results to chemically sulfated hyaluronan. HSV-1 recognized all sulfated GAGs, but not the nonsulfated hyaluronan, indicating that binding is specific to the presence of sulfate groups. Furthermore we observed that a notable fraction of GAG-bound virions exhibit lateral mobility, although the multivalent binding to the immobilized GAG brushes ensures firm virus attachment to the interface. Diffusion was faster on the two native GAGs, one of which, chondroitin sulfate, was also characterized by the highest association rate per GAG chain. This highlights the complexity of multivalent virus-GAG interactions and suggests that the spatial arrangement of sulfates along native GAG chains may play a role in modulating the characteristics of the HSV-GAG interaction. Altogether, these results, obtained with a minimal and well-controlled model of the cell membrane, provide, to our knowledge, new insights into the dynamics of the HSV-GAG interaction.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/011e6ee206e8c042511e8ede46b89914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fec6aefa9fe1bc492710ac62c882734, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14f376c9c93c495beb3497070ac06669, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/154fb27625e62b359237d4591abcf741, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a67a37e00e69f799afc807ae9b44e55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b220db7a37627f10c6724401d0134c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e726f8e5e0f0d55cdb9f08e5ae2e0fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22c4e06b6cca32e327e9eed7bc5ce85d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28f0b935de60042a027e095d171a0ca3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29bf8b8d95de109764b5aa43183e60e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/321d0f2ae4a08d844476d7adaba7cdbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3243229e779cf14aa55867d6c7276548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34f26f2f5192fa3037a00ed9c5f99371, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38ad6fc9d20ef827190f011d82c652cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39a6b387e9afdcb59d9693c456feca79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41d7eae1346ca2cf9727d37567890865, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/504cb47eb322760bd1938295cf2dcd82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/583d0a39781ab4435b6f522190100b7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/597fc1b3d1d4bcc92d51b3dad510bb46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65821e1594c6fedcf4b9bf4683239c20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/760d7318791d785fe308cce1ea393fd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78d672d91cf57c1c1e24b9c1fae986d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e7d76a5eb268d43e7cafd313ab6aa80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f6db11e69f1deffa704bb4c47540490, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fa25576739d29b133d5c37f74e29253, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80dc3e70b9e446b65a278eb6c7ae7a3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/849a1323cabb5eca495afb07bb9e1cab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89f1c477fd5f5ddd741d310ffecfdbf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d121f34126ca0fd509bc50a07301f31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/923a5a74f2793a70142186ba28004e44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92beba34ddb599e52dd20929457e6036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/999d106ffa428f07981d9d8d7717797d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b94a51cba31ee3f007fe8e13718bc11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6b9cc483022e4e1a7277e018a364104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abe14e33ba97aebe7d0ebdfe80121227, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0480f21eb5a341ec1d7c29d0afc831f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b20d7d13ec6ea05ac7454adb2a2940db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b49ee214340cc543e0da3659c811c035, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5084b3f41844ef5363fe9b90cca37d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b56e2fc6f4b266533bab02a688313d0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bec83031fbda2d2eea074951bbe0ca9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c38c0d2295d860c3d8db277b1673d098, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6f07beeb1b6950d2eb489b276e66ba1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d73d29ff0a4a3b79ca840deca580c33b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daba292863e873770761db823ae05c83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e34385a93a3564bb9df85f6499b7a374"

Briefly summarized, they are: 1. An infection, probably of viral type, may attack the oligodendroglia of the central nervous system; or, 2. An autoimmune process may begin with an infection of the peripheral lymphatic immune system, producing antibodies that cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to myelinoclasia. Since 1935, research has been directed toward myelin of the central nervous system and the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerve; however, dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG) have apparently not been studied. The present hypothesis states that an infectious agent (probably viral) finds privileged sanctuary in the dorsal root and cranial sensory ganglia (DRG): thereafter periodically invading the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerve. Previously reported erratic spinal fluid viral titers and cultures can be explained by differences in the anatomy of the DRG in which there is a variable and limited contact of spinal fluid with sensory ganglia. Clues to this hypothesis were noted by the author during routine neurological examinations of patients with MS, in which sensory signs and symptoms were frequently encountered. This clinical observation has also been reported by others who found such symptoms in 75% of MS patients, ranking second only to incoordination.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a6e47b3742acac8b7ec42d5c5f2bada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0def3b974e8a6661553da7c1c9e0903d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12ab68dce0f7c01965d0bd35b849882e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ca3995d5bd7419823dc7d84a2bb2dd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/241a5ce23b1707e72f12868bb80bc40c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/336a0f485830488e828928501bb8f3f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34d54a25aa8197bf7aeee7bbb9c91984, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cae0b90ee254f83ec27f054694c6801, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67eff2c98ede5eabe743ef7f1739d582, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72e4e3012d230a5c064bcf84acc3a11b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73145c20be64798a5b84e1c63ef1a9fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74bb3f57824f2ea2877f8467039bb6c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f5d638b4e0970e4c64eb453b6b9e951, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8455359a23c0a1cf2843ecac52de9900, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88b81b0610c804f7838419214af3b182, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b493ae5addee272242b7f6584ced972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d7e75f915978d1a094afcab67c6ec4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bbe310360404c3eeddabe6e2dbacc81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aacc2e84cc4bcd29f0baed0d15ae2ba5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aba430d6269fa821a1f643a8cacdf72b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac1ce1d9be645e125b755210673fc938, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae7f8cecfafbed89e6e250daf375cbeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc7a9d1ed9555005e7e43a72dbbbb36b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c600339277b40bb63fcfcd0c4eac18e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6859e2634ce47c5c8e573870a809214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc7d616f287e7e6856e0678270850d47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f727645daaea3c07f6c3c1c4683bf7b8"

Based on reports of decreased Th1 cytokines in some patients and the development of BA in mice lacking CD4(+) T cells, we hypothesized that Th1-independent mechanisms can also activate effector cells and induce BA. Here, we tested this hypothesis using Stat1(–/–) mice, which lack the ability to mount Th1 immune responses. Infection of Stat1(–/–) mice with rhesus rotavirus type A (RRV) on postnatal day 1 induced a prominent Th2 response, duct epithelial injury and obstruction within 7 days, and atresia shortly thereafter. A high degree of phosphorylation of the Th2 transcription factor Stat6 was observed; however, concurrent inactivation of Stat1 and Stat6 in mice did not prevent BA after RRV infection. In contrast, depletion of macrophages or combined loss of Il13 and Stat1 reduced tissue infiltration by lymphocytes and myeloid cells, maintained epithelial integrity, and prevented duct obstruction. In concordance with our mouse model, humans at the time of BA diagnosis exhibited differential hepatic expression of Th2 genes and serum Th2 cytokines. These findings demonstrate compatibility between Th2 commitment and the pathogenesis of BA, and suggest that patient subgrouping in future clinical trials should account for differences in Th2 status.",""

Chloroquine has also been used as anti-inflammatory drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a dual effect in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury: chloroquine on the one hand could protect the liver against I/R injury via inhibition of inflammatory response, but on the other hand could aggravate liver I/R injury through inhibition of autophagy. Rats (n=6 per group) were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. At the early phase (i.e., 0–6 h after reperfusion), chloroquine treatment ameliorated liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines and fewer histopathologic changes. In contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury at the late phase of reperfusion (i.e., 24–48 h after reperfusion). The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine appeared to involve its ability to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1 release and inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver injury via inhibition of autophagy and induction of hepatic apoptosis at the late phase. In conclusion, chloroquine prevents ischemic liver damage at the early phase, but aggravates liver damage at the late phase in liver I/R injury. This dual role of chloroquine should be considered when using chloroquine as an inhibitor of inflammation or autophagy in I/R injury.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09958e9b7567a808e977f99ddf2b4eac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10a3ae466e67f9a115880073481b28ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d9c3bd7f4ee9ac341b55868f4d52584, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/200523fe2abbeb10b620bfb7fba1c350, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a118de2934c72b6b32d5168b6179da5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e57ba3158e7ff497433e366796da640, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f8d01accae54d4164c3236ee5b5e6bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/300c4d304bad85df693c677a35e3fa60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32e577dbc282b238cd4ce7f03ad0d291, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a1c5efa2dd756201a54874ac6e9095e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cef3eba2daabcf5f33214f5586fe161, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1ee197f3094674583502b12fce3cd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47501457fe746af78cc7b5809cf3a0a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/494754e2e5bf8bc0031f72c55698c8b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a1540bb3fb268e4a9b932e2385acf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a2873279be7b1ad03a87f879dcdeee6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a5ed6afb6f923b0e5923ca445abf2cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/514bc71e81379c66aad833c1b6a58f7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54970c481eceff292f9f85cbd2815c71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/575a553ae38e18a4545d4b282e882c94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74d5978bc711901100e646cb219adcbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/862f34fd38940ba32d0caf0f750c7d27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0aeb8d05b1cec376585263292f4baac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2c778777872d2e41355355434327c8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb94cee729130235d2f4aa7f897e54d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbe8a0a67fad5c0a14babca9731fda21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfe22e13f5ac9788d3c86f74f3dc11a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb6c3306ab9642d89f1de1f35977d4e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc25e0c0aec8dc23db1db0f70a4e044f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d546b4b3a1bdccf2939ef5dd637f2256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df7b57e4ef2aa45a298290f17961d4dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea552ef22752cbc1ad9c367e173b6083, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1f3ccbd9437b999b63458bf54adcefe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8ecc308c3370db7c4b6e1bc3921e0c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f93ce85b5dd8edca418a4fd5dc4d651e"

The aerosol particles were captured and removed from the air by rain and the concentration of aerosol particles significantly decreased after rain events. Therefore, rain is regarded as having a good effect on air environments in terms of the respiratory health of the general public. However, humid environments produced by long-term rain events such a monsoon may be a sufficient condition for the growth of microorganisms and vibrations because of the splashing of droplets may facilitate the aerosolization of ground microorganisms. We therefore hypothesize that the rain may increase concentrations of bioaerosols in outdoor air environments, thereby possibly influencing respiratory diseases. To verify this hypothesis, at the initial stepwise approach, we measured the concentration of airborne biological particles before, after, and during rain in a monsoon season. The measurement data of the concentration of fungal particles and bacterial particles show quantitatively that the bioaerosol concentrations during the rain event are several times higher than the concentration of the bioaerosols in the condition of no rain.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00dd77f9e4d81db2d76192620eca06e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0403202b7f3ead078fd405b7742ec9d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ae9f839230b0d0627ebc4fe41dd7290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cbc84748104f23132cb40fa01c2d2c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33d651aa5e6e00b68c6a979d83ae48ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88ae3816fa8561ea88489e11ce306c66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89c78278f83e3626bccdc9cab9c54a7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc31a3fa15aeb8d05add5662ae8370a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7e02c1459a738c43701dde8a25a5da1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2e7e2ea291e68a151c7a60b2728c0f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efcf45fc9fdae5adc6ee3680e10b955c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f05dd5e12ce5d3ffb463d0ccc00c98a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5aa8f97d176930cb4764c2ac1aee172"

In temperate climates, outbreaks peak during the winter season. The mechanism by which climatic factors influence the occurrence of NoV outbreaks is unknown. We hypothesized that humidity is linked to NoV seasonality. Human NoV is not cultivatable, so we used cultivatable murine norovirus (MNV) as a surrogate to study its persistence when exposed to various levels of relative humidity (RH) from low (10% RH) to saturated (100% RH) conditions at 9 and 25°C. In addition, we conducted similar experiments with virus-like particles (VLPs) from the predominant GII-4 norovirus and studied changes in binding patterns to A, B, and O group carbohydrates that might reflect capsid alterations. The responses of MNV and VLP to humidity were somewhat similar, with 10 and 100% RH exhibiting a strong conserving effect for both models, whereas 50% RH was detrimental for MNV infectivity and VLP binding capacity. The data analysis suggested that absolute humidity (AH) rather than RH is the critical factor for keeping NoV infectious, with an AH below 0.007 kg water/kg air being favorable to NoV survival. Retrospective surveys of the meteorological data in Paris for the last 14 years showed that AH average values have almost always been below 0.007 kg water/kg air during the winter (i.e., 0.0046 ± 0.0014 kg water/kg air), and this finding supports the fact that low AH provides an ideal condition for NoV persistence and transmission during cold months.",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) specifically designed to detect FCoV spike gene mutations at two nucleotide positions. It was hypothesized that this test would correctly discriminate feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). METHODS: The study included 63 cats with signs consistent with FIP. FIP was confirmed in 38 cats. Twenty-five control cats were definitively diagnosed with a disease other than FIP. Effusion and/or serum/plasma samples were examined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the two FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058 L and S1060A using an allelic discrimination approach. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples. In effusion, sensitivity was 68.6% (95% CI 50.7–83.2), specificity was 95.8% (95% CI 78.9–99.9). No serum/plasma samples were positive for FIPV. CONCLUSIONS: Although specificity of the test in effusions was high, one false positive result occurred. The use of serum/plasma cannot be recommended due to a low viral load in blood.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b1352c61e40d31115f35377ff38ae54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dae97d8eb0f75f99bce8eb4cea959af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1be4cf5577862507d045db30107831b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2304e0a462d4c73792255ae4b4dc080a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32c1e13dfb805978c29bcf204e2ca6ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ed5995e6704a3accf269988d5cfb9b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/519f3861f9fa343393654f0a58005c53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62b05187b3af3f33c44f745210b893a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6eb7ece47143d53b6e2981f551078da6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73e2b67c402b69fc221b17eb356c3e29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78228981b50ab20b0f1f01c11bec1189, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/833c6eba92df0f14e84925a1b1d8d8ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ac936c9254f66cb2cc0e5e16aef47db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94c3de51a42d6248a670646df8d8d304, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e1d5a267946b220fbd11a064a3d5027, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae471c6a0ec83461c3fd91da43c8b73c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b702fd881272e06ecd1a83cff71a4155, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f90ef67a6af188e05332736a673d2b9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fedcd4bb6b5fa96a5b662a9c2638095b"

The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/106db0ce508751e19f9edd2ecc7f2156, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2352c937ea749e63b1fae382ab09e33a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43e03f11dbb4eff253a381f62fd5c15c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46f05f9d61a6721c753a194b5b07f0d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46fb46a3da70e905b89ba1fa58e1848c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4717fa705ac3247da968cbe89b7216ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a4a780aa384f4a4c18741f05f2a0ded, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ebda80bcb9980ea89e8eb01d71cc3fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62e90669db46916fe4641528b5645635, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6622792d8d4a13387c6e71996c5f9d52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74c964d882e1b197fd8e67ee128ce3b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75f65e1020e376b5077035a2e39c7ef1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/772f45d0ba185122ecd1dbbffa5c99e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/791cb72c02c4dc50ae66a2a3d30b4a0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93b5415c3a6eee8e62345345598ca94d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99d083a8a06a1cb09ab9ed99aea5451b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aaee21eefb57d4018c3961b626ce791, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a14b976f29110e655eb3d9e710d6d846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a74377d7227278541d0899c95d303731, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf32b45505594d66ae2acf6d33b12a8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf3f95f4f5c3b87327f9ce19df326803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9d224b962c514027cee1ffddbcd6778, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec07c0c38dab5a66352ccf6d9cc42d52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec5f10a8ff81c439394b428b8dba9db5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efcac8c152c49a75524443c9a709cf9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a25f4fb645cc459e72f58fd4d93ac9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4aaf9406251f073e7e9f8560e72909d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4c366dfb86c983e4db383f6627c473b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f50ccc927518aef8354e02b3734cbc76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd85ac0a74f94b949af95b5cf5943e1a"

In asthma, injury to epithelial cells can occur during bronchoconstriction, which may exacerbate airway hyperreactivity. To investigate the role of epithelial cell rupture in airway constriction, laser ablation was used to precisely rupture individual airway epithelial cells of small airways (<300-μm diameter) in rat lung slices (∼250-μm thick). Laser ablation of single epithelial cells using a femtosecond laser reproducibly induced airway contraction to ∼70% of the original cross-sectional area within several seconds, and the contraction lasted for up to 40 s. The airway constriction could be mimicked by mechanical rupture of a single epithelial cell using a sharp glass micropipette but not with a blunt glass pipette. These results suggest that soluble mediators released from the wounded epithelial cell induce global airway contraction. To confirm this hypothesis, the lysate of primary human small airway epithelial cells stimulated a similar airway contraction. Laser ablation of single epithelial cells triggered a single instantaneous Ca(2+) wave in the epithelium, and multiple Ca(2+) waves in smooth muscle cells, which were delayed by several seconds. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or decreasing intracellular Ca(2+) both blocked laser-induced airway contraction. We conclude that local epithelial cell rupture induces rapid and global airway constriction through release of soluble mediators and subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent smooth muscle shortening.",""

The outcomes evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores and respiratory scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 – 60 d of age), and carryover effects on post-weaning (61 – 90 d of age) periods. The experimental units utilized were 29 newborn Holstein × Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth of 32.2 ± 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood cell count, weekly to determinate ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and acetate:proprionate proportion - C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 during pre and post-weaning (P ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil (P ≤ 0.001) and platelet (P ≤ 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P ≤ 0.001), revealing a long-term treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P ≤ 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d574c4d138f62ff91d171cff6faca55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dc457473012312ed1673cf975c2e701, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/122ca63ae4ba2927e837fd367fbd47dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/122cf666e0e60ebdefd98995512c80fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15293f87b05b9e20c4b8c927e66aa45e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15fe1511c9dcf97e7c1c4d237a0675aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a2f13946a299b1188b93cd36e34395b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a728573526bc21d71f7f91e14392163, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20d9d9e524c10a108a443747e467f646, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c8587aaafa6fb9b4f33c659e2882e01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e5d3096830184d3ac5a0348c35f3d04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3120ed9417658884312f224443fb35ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32f6f1f62a4a5ccdcced25a9b3400e3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39c8586d3dafecf15fb4db6805c98016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/419c647b26dcae8192589c304651473f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45262d2f8e447d6aa2f88fbe7af62e31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46787c521c94b2cf5b10a6836fca270e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e6ff9b71036ffeb371598bd15edf066, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5324c0843d3a7d95e80f56021803a64b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/540f43866896822b108b7fec425931f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/586c2dcc034eca76c1e67a0d6e6393b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5da23d959253b72cadf035812a422c58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/603f17dc93ab4911add93ea116a94d0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61af40c2699e5351c7f6911afdc8baad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63cc2938264b3ea20f67220398b36524, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/666be2076b6cc58ef0a963091b0ed494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73b49893eaa7a3952102c520fe51ffc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/747157aa961aede81b8f189c19b5120a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79f21f89240fba7d6b36361792e36ba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ce092fd2d0269b3e67000c98d5b7460, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f0a3787381ccb3a6de2a23452ec416b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81303f732dc9f0e18ac14cda0488d244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83979076ffa6dbc5798fd7ec63645b5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83a01b852bc282efa27d8dd230881f30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8614f6db5a62004ff8caaeb27b47c9c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b8ffa954441dc5ccc6f99b96443186b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a053328afc72feb670afba9e6667d4bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a18449b512e3314428dbb3def71e4980, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2f526b0318edfc799b5e3474efcadc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a86cc5ad77539489a1e4e4ddd92ac199, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a877c4af01b985ab4d43ec126a5459f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa5e053ee2a15aeb3964eadeee5d2ecc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abcf85b6bf153e808de7c9e668b904c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abf441c839b5f896c74b1ffd8f767d66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3d0650cee8d7298e8e63b72d7763db7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4c32f0a056bdbac423b6dbd82b3099f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29592a491aa340e293ea6eadb00efe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c415c9b84bc97889c4c6ecf595e0f65c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5bbc59b42704c9e6e998c4eeebc2a3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6532cd1f908641d0f384cc5d19b4779, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0837097773e18eefc91a4f9b93f44a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0a7d31f83aea95032303292d0e4fcd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3767086926eedf837f5a7a68fff2ed6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d44f4f522a960bb1c2f0cc65aa7d7ff5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d671e9a79d84ba85149f1f2a3648a929, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d89570fbd74b4efcaf55157aade2f200, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc3dc91d9fd358b4c88ce286fe711025, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1d73d2b3e33bc668e802d82b4f52062, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3e4a250a18917a8a9b36f75128f4e40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6188b3ece3a479178b884344929e4db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e86e69d13b61d563c00b7739ec2f5a0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec745f608c8da086cdf5ee4af139804c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4fa517de699501098060d3d4159a5ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f676f3b6e842592a36a97f40433002a6"

Two antisera directed against fusion proteins containing sequences encoded in portions of the 3'-terminal 2.0 kb of ORF 1b were used to immunoprecipitate p90, p74, p53, p44, and p32 polypeptides. These polypeptides were clearly different in electrophoretic mobility, antiserum reactivity, and partial protease digestion pattern from viral structural proteins and from polypeptides encoded in the 5' end of ORF 1a, previously identified by in vitro translation. The largest of these polypeptides had partial protease digestion patterns similar to those of polypeptides generated by in vitro translation of a synthetic mRNA derived from the 3' end of ORF 1b. The polypeptides encoded in ORF 1b accumulated more slowly during in vitro translation than polypeptides encoded in ORF 1a. This is consistent with the hypothesis that translation of gene A initiates at the 5' end of ORF 1a and that translation of ORF 1b occurs following a frameshift at the ORF 1a-ORF 1b junction. The use of in vitro translation of genome RNA and immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against various regions of the polypeptides encoded in gene A should make it possible to study synthesis and processing of the putative coronavirus polymerase.",""

The gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GaLV) and koala retrovirus (KoRV), two gammaretroviruses, are also the result of a transspecies transmission, however from a still unknown host. Related retroviruses have been found in Southeast Asian mice although the sequence similarity was limited. Viruses with a higher sequence homology were isolated from Melomys burtoni, the Australian and Indonesian grassland melomys. However, only the habitats of the koalas and the grassland melomys in Australia are overlapping, indicating that the melomys virus may not be the precursor of the GaLV. Viruses closely related to GaLV/KoRV were also detected in bats. Therefore, given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in Thailand and the koalas in Australia are far away, and that bats are able to fly over long distances, the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration. Analysis of previous transspecies transmissions of retroviruses may help to evaluate the potential of transmission of related retroviruses in the future, e.g., that of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) during xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ea73904b79ec74234b24b55d037fde7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fb59e21ec3dccfb58a771a72511ab6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/106e9d863accfa159f17bd22c0238bf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c6034d6e159e5d9fdfb516cf887eec8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3467d798bb22bcbe7eb5ac2a4107073a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35b47d72c184ba1aa6b0dbe5d9d7f27f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ca4da32824475a98ff37ca58987d5a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f2048e003288d32c464e57f404d4b35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c815ed66ab652b4cde399d351b60df2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f3cc62f3533a03b3f60ca966cb34437, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54a7983dce0e1efc637b3b3764ab078f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dcce5e5c0f47d3e4e7ae781d416cf17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/613d4626a74eb4bab2cc21003debd035, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66ce10c8be08af04176ec49abb479a27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7471eb0817e24cbfc40879472bcb4840, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/770d31933ddde9dd493421cf059cb5b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86e1ea81eeb3d69a0a412121b0dc0161, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a5a11ccd93678765e98d078278a24a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e624213f3efbce063e261edb714cac2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92984198846edc13cc1001ef221548f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95cd9d72894c757085fbf7b6a60e2549, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/968906bc46db61402ff3ce7af9a2413f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac2db239f9f85aa94f330fb4e0fa5f7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad40c9da0465b1fb71015f5b7cb74e65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b10ebe9fff9ae20bc3a87284eea89c8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6c2d3e45a24cd7dbdb8192f4871ada5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b89556fdaab2d424f23b400b845e75c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd1423f7f81b24d15f31b336f64f544f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b94ffb6d7418e0ba28fb5e7f176f17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4e9b4200bda740470d3ae7537809eac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5d89a1b4a6e7588731aaaec7aab8c02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9d757297b2c13c249c22260bf777c08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db0eb650603b5cac8653dbd0482feaf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd848cbd2ff1b2e79e2aa0cac49fd160, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfa1234483c3c3fa1b3070368b7c6856, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6adfce06c02bb5d3a55ff15da524bec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4e607d8a0cf59375bebaceb2d40d1c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f786932727bc2bdffefb873c3c6700b6"

Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exists as both a circulating hormone system and as a local paracrine signaling mechanism within various tissues including the brain, kidney, and adipose, and this system is strongly implicated in cardiovascular health and disease. Growing evidence also implicates the RAS in the control of energy balance, supporting the concept that the RAS may be mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity hypertension. Here, we review the involvement of the RAS in the entire spectrum of whole organism energy balance mechanisms, including behaviors (food ingestion and spontaneous physical activity) and biological processes (digestive efficiency and both aerobic and nonaerobic resting metabolic rates). We hypothesize that opposing, tissue-specific effects of the RAS to modulate these various components of energy balance can explain the apparently paradoxical results reported by energy-balance studies that involve stimulating, versus disrupting, the RAS. We propose a model in which such opposing and tissue-specific effects of the RAS can explain the failure of simple, global RAS blockade to result in weight loss in humans, and hypothesize that obesity-mediated uncoupling of endogenous metabolic rate control mechanisms can explain the phenomenon of obesity-related hypertension.",""

The principal receptor for MHV is murine CEACAM1 (mCEACAM1). Susceptible strains of mice are homozygous for the 1a allele of mCeacam1, while SJL mice are homozygous for the 1b allele. mCEACAM1a (1a) has a 10- to 100-fold-higher receptor activity than does mCEACAM1b (1b). To explore the hypothesis that MHV susceptibility is due to the different MHV receptor activities of 1a and 1b, we established a chimeric C57BL/6 mouse (cB61ba) in which a part of the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of the mCeacam1a (1a) gene, which is responsible for MHV receptor function, is replaced by the corresponding region of mCeacam1b (1b). We compared the MHV susceptibility of these chimeric mice to that of SJL and B6 mice. B6 mice that are homozygous for 1a are highly susceptible to MHV-A59 infection, with a 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of 10(2.5) PFU, while chimeric cB61ba mice and SJL mice homozygous for 1ba and 1b, respectively, survived following inoculation with 10(5) PFU. Unexpectedly, cB61ba mice were more resistant to MHV-A59 infection than SJL mice as measured by virus replication in target organs, including liver and brain. No infectious virus or viral RNA was detected in the organs of cB61ba mice, while viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in target organs of SJL mice. Furthermore, SJL mice produced antiviral antibodies after MHV-A59 inoculation with 10(5) PFU, but cB61ba mice did not. Thus, cB61ba mice are apparently completely resistant to MHV-A59 infection, while SJL mice permit low levels of MHV-A59 virus replication during self-limited, asymptomatic infection. When expressed on cultured BHK cells, the mCEACAM1b and mCEACAM1ba proteins had similar levels of MHV-A59 receptor activity. These results strongly support the hypothesis that although alleles of mCEACAM1 are the principal determinants of mouse susceptibility to MHV-A59, other as-yet-unidentified murine genes may also play a role in susceptibility to MHV.",""

This feature has previously relegated HRVs to being considered passengers in acute respiratory infections. HRVs remain poorly characterized and are seldom included as a target in diagnostic panels despite their pathogenic potential, infection-associated healthcare expenditure and relatively unmoderated elicitation of an antiviral state. Objectives To test the hypothesis that respiratory viruses are proportionately more or less likely to co-occur, particularly the HRVs. Study design Retrospective PCR-based analyses of 1247 specimens for 17 viruses, including HRV strains, identified 131 specimens containing two or more targets. We investigated the proportions of co-detections and compared the proportion of upper vs. lower respiratory tract presentations in the HRV positive group. Both univariate contingency table and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify trends of association among the viruses present in co-detections. Results Many of the co-detections occurred in patterns. In particular, HRV detection was associated with a reduced probability of detecting human adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A virus, and the polyomaviruses KIPyV and WUPyV (p ≤0.05). No single HRV species nor cluster of particular strains predominated. Conclusions HRVs were proportionately under-represented among viral co-detections. For some period, HRVs may render the host less likely to be infected by other viruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/072a07ad008c09803a13d6113bd0b38a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/155aa43909c527130dd2dee126084602, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/183398de125779d23a81a957da84c6cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2255e48f1ce26b6381cd8c03ddc49453, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3478fac9d7f783e81129ba2e8c0fe22c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/356cb3b0c9b93111c675ccd1c0f65cb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f5a047acfdfe5a2036f8d2aacf296f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46f12b2c5fc78d7cafcb87edf204aff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b5650e4bc2854c48628c98aaa4e4618, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bdf834df18d73a83120b08efa50750b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59bf6b91fc3b7a9b01e9f303350a1cd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61aaaddeab6f5a7453bb11fdf4792685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c8c7cdcdca7f06893d1fb112a71aeb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73bb94404ec742be31019c2cfc54d1c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/834a1d7f966a8a4eea8fb1dbf7e22081, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83aa68505bf0dac4718d7aed804ef77c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a2d5135ef0fdd654297e827aa9bcf2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/905353eeeeaaf84fcd930e6304eabb96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9afdde79c6bb6b761dd2c546d0d731bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f41cdf36b449727482d10ec996fef74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a39a2ee76bfdf9373b88a9d36ca38c73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7c88815545224caa334f658ed781d2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8bfda64e9852261cb459ed0cceb1ae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2ac0477125311d607f97da4a002ca4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf81d6f4014cdd3b6d73af1086e77e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0cdd6019667c9d3b3446f24669d4493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c217c8e76dcbc06b69508134c5197212, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7147f76eee44bdea9d1dd0c416d083b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eda763ac08bf097b10c113209823fb04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f104192407bdf4ed364c6b18138397c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f76b15c9b420970bf26da28ef1829729"

Infancy is also a critical time for post-natal lung growth and development. Severe or repeated lower airway injury in very young children likely increases the likelihood of chronic pulmonary disorders later in life. Globally, bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. Compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. Our study tests the hypothesis that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, improve the clinical outcomes of Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We are conducting a dual centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in northern Australia. Indigenous infants (aged ≤ 24-months, expected number = 200) admitted to one of two regional hospitals (Darwin, Northern Territory and Townsville, Queensland) with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation concealed) to either azithromycin (30 mg/kg/dose) or placebo administered once weekly for three doses. Clinical data are recorded twice daily and nasopharyngeal swab are collected at enrolment and at the time of discharge from hospital. Primary outcomes are 'length of oxygen requirement' and 'duration of stay,' the latter based upon being judged as 'ready for respiratory discharge'. The main secondary outcome is readmission for a respiratory illness within 6-months of leaving hospital. Descriptive virological and bacteriological (including development of antibiotic resistance) data from nasopharyngeal samples will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Two published studies, both involving different patient populations and settings, as well as different macrolide antibiotics and treatment duration, have produced conflicting results. Our randomised, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis is designed to determine whether it can reduce short-term (and potentially long-term) morbidity from respiratory illness in Australian Indigenous infants who are at high risk of developing chronic respiratory illness. If azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the morbidly of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis, the intervention would lead to improved short term (and possibly long term) health benefits.

The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1168800e4d5c1e46dca067f0b11b0989, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/145bc1332be39a734d1879361fdbdaca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21deadf391e392c8ac290bcc1ebd4a1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/282826e6ab7848f974b606a0d3786c87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3257d6d178f3e842fc3dbe174c59687d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3719ce344e9650cfc008958855f2f782, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/479e696b2f9ea92d38e579d9db570ae1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/559560576d7639bf2d559a7d08363abd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58d821e0c3dd902a0748e37de3ae5796, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5afedc16aeb01f07195f3b391e7f7fb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e84c13c0424ade18de726b6d4ea5d98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b8d06f6496b63f46b8786c53c07d06f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c725beede0373b8d3edd27a0f6b8965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d6b46723a030af6c3d78c9de0ccf05d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73aaafd5d6dff1993e20dc9068e41385, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78dd7552c961e3122f8acbff995ad7f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a401018e0854b2ffb7349a4ea5951da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ca340d8ef1c7985543df2c26240ac88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7de2c5ae0b6b53f87478b7f72b4f880e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84266731cea29d5fb6e3a6781be63cfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85202f421f11460c8caa7fe0928611b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fcc18539ce30c92e66f7e2206ea7b73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/905e57be55d4024b2cddc7dd756de96c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b3ff7683263a406d5236dd1914f1a22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d90f1051beba639d9f8c63e8c87154a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a26fa9b3c22ddac09e22445d201eb15d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3f6adbdce8d4b2bf51697aeb513f44c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5b1945c14f4222a5da6d83d87ad8786, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa2e2b3c714c6edf49941b9157245424, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad788c3803487b412bb6c66df41ad4ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3462d8a1e45a45427b2123a2f68c937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5508ed3a269a2ac71263dd095ab67ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbafb2474cbab6c9244d45ac38dee713, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbe055d18532db380d81c7a57843081e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3b0c99ee965dcb81ccce21e20267cd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d721301c3104409cfd0f7188a9149001, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4fe1fb34278220b567cfba08834439d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9081d0c6c9b8e277b563ac12de893aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe15b5e1447e9ee58ba4a9718f5626e1"

Within the overlap, ORF2b lacks an AUG translational start codon and is therefore presumably translated by -1 ribosomal frameshifting as a transframe protein with ORF2a. This hypothesis was studied by introducing the putative frameshift region into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and testing for the occurrence of frameshifting in vivo by transient expression of GUS activity in potato protoplasts as well as in vitro by translation in the reticulocyte system. Both experimental approaches demonstrate that a -1 frameshift occurs at a frequency of approximately 1%. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the frameshift region and the involvement of the novel heptanucleotide motif UUUAAAU in conjunction with an adjacent stem-loop structure. Part of this stem-loop encodes a basic region in the ORF2b moiety of the transframe protein which was shown by binding experiments with PLRV RNA to represent a nucleic acid-binding domain. These data support a possible biological significance of the frameshift to occur at this position of the large overlap by including the putative RNA template-binding site of the PLRV replicase in the ORF2a/ORF2b transframe protein.",""

Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one- or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13c6e958983e77b20f4d23c998c8f759, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14405a459cd37bab73b2d7e022e77408, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d4d056d68e06bd654bfbc4f61aea730, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1de4594c4aed1517a323002a0b7a8aa0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22c742f07a2d5a79f403c8ab7ef8c84b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/234aca499e7678bf202cbcc74a4c2460, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24c55b609da168da39c1c5d7ba87fcc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2768e9b8db9a53c62db312fb707943fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b425cecfe06b5a81cbabf90de7d388a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32bae2b7b512f857b993da7cea117146, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3317fb665c8ba11c5f15b0625b9c1fe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33671452a2a4207be05d12c7693a7086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3602d2030333b9a0c7bf17426b5ad6c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e5122d4425de1fdcf3ca20bf5208304, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46b4af8d77224636c6322b42945806a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47810b55822646d750e5a499241e2fce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/483be9463669372f2c7c5f19a2776d10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52a2c27589bfede1287bc8451c5348c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/576cd7871cd6c9c515bda35249d60f5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b14c5dd57ed9566d31262be95255fe0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b152e3e9789cc27213b2ba95f01f22f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65fecf631054a041495021a00fe153f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a567f9ff3d6180faca7400514b40166, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ad19e66a35a19a856adb908ce30b54a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b197c1b5ab781c6ced52c975d1aaaaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e8b5493c2d7ebc29fab17f8f7acbe75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77fd8eb8858a9de38d899026125ef030, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79d3e77b1110e1c17c35fe1079f28f3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86ef09300e93634f88bce322f5706ed7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e490ce9bba6a3a0a9d78385f5850caa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98fa19c3a35910629bbf00390898b6f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a14d967b0f5677e2ee7314fd9f9b4080, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a52a0530e8f1bde7717913c8bb5b216b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3161fb64465e99eb2aa7721e98d3052, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b49208e505b71c8b058b9344169aba90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc24445c54b1c4a59aaa99a28cea268e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d072829d831e61816935d8698d0fb899, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e35987c7fae94d03af11f015cb6edfc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef0edb8dbc7a7882e1e19d753be09cb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2dbd25d022ea00a92436d41700ac9f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8fcb38c7ca3140d3a48cc95e32c6eb9"

Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1β (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-β (IFN-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/063079229cde3060200aac3839c1c9b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1335bbae23d6b01110ccaf7e5b0a1616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29435be15d2117d1a2c73d706e9e6d87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c15e26cc6e0a123dbd161965f75b38c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33b38040ae65aa3924a65edaee49cb33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f0681cea111dfc13a22859b1cdf3cbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f07baa05d8e71d381b78a27dbc8538c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40b86ad56175ba604721e3c76d33d525, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b417eb034953fd659fea0e56fcdaf7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f370e71267dac7ed4a35697fcc27321, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/542485d02ab54b6cc9d1cd20430606f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5424be20864e961e8d5f31b3776ea70d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b4ecbb1ee67e58ef9e930871e5a890f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b96fd962dccd9263edd59cdd3deb53d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e092ffd4ce98d66eb1e1be786b9201e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69b9d168b8b114b012fe4bca77f09863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c11aeae138baca8d01b541a07311649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72cabee1ea7cd71e4fa5c4b911096391, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7aae38da2588e816bab78cac61856b15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82421c49bc980cb90b826ee7d0ccfc87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dcbe48e6a4bb2db1bc8a658357f043d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9073f2239f484d272b4a37f72c25c5dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9208fa0e2a7928ef05bbf8479d9f39ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9efc2fe2a2206fdf00bf41e133c3cc40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2438a050e5c3986e2d76cd3eae3e767, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a55d7079dca8e347c7644fed138ea333, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b26f88a8c1de83ec0b590fbdf4a8f3c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3f6c0ebef364cbc39a8b952724c23da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbe177b730694571d87c296e08b2a677, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2f24225bcf7fe674306d282b7dafe4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd0dce67da06fcecb307b817648264fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de0f3e36fbe3d1222a102269efb90459, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e04ca7de516829ab3c3ae464b0edfe87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9026858b75a9eb18695783bcfc40a86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f347ceef6eb7c84310ac1efac6b2bb3f"

No replication was observed, but synthetic transcripts of a cloned reporter-containing defective interfering (DI) RNA differing from the N mRNA construct by 433 nt of continuous 5'-proximal genomic sequence between the leader and the N open reading frame did replicate and become packaged, indicating the insufficiency of the leader alone as a 5' signal for replication of transfected RNA molecules. The leader was shown to be a necessary part of the cis-acting signal for DI RNA replication, however, since removal of terminal bases that destroyed a predicted intraleader stem-loop also destroyed replicating ability. Surprisingly, when the same stem-loop was disrupted by base substitutions, replication appeared only minimally impaired and the leader was found to have rapidly reverted to wild type during DI RNA replication, a phenomenon reminiscent of high-frequency leader switching in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. These results suggest that once a minimal structural requirement for leader is fulfilled for initiation of DI RNA replication, the wild-type leader is strongly preferred for subsequent replication. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to reported natural mouse hepatitis coronavirus DI RNAs, the DI RNA of the bovine coronavirus does not require sequence elements originating from discontinuous downstream regions within the polymerase gene for replication or for packaging.",""

Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarray to profile essentially all human genes, we observed that 426 probe signals were changed by >2.9-fold in the SPB placentas, compared with the spontaneous term birth (STB) placentas. Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (≤32.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056). CONCLUSION: We have identified 36 SPB-associated RNA transcripts, which are possibly detectable in maternal plasma. We have illustrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA was more frequently detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples collected from women resulting in SPB than the gestational-age matched controls.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24da6a3f37d87303cb39aa1541906145, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34ec07e9f6ffe62a10659e650c1074e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ba833cfa5ed0332207d81639c756ad2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40a1ca18d73ae45f2fffa2a3ad6146a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82537b411d0b3ca7ca4a77346cec8343, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1570999ab68fe128b8920e0de00d88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d6848986f0a52104b053353ac8e856c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d6cc9e52007ce88d5569e62cff3ae7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7f68bcf7862ec91dd709d94215aafae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdba397f88902b3526dae184c3ba0780, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eee289001cb0ab773dae34921cae2c64"

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.",""

We subjected CHIKV-infected Human Embryo Kidney cells (HEK293), a widely used cell-based system for CHIKV infection studies, to a high throughput expression proteomics analysis by Liquid Chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1047 differentially expressed proteins were identified in infected cells, consistently in three biological replicates. Proteins involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis and stress response were the major ones among the 209 proteins that had significant up-regulation. In the set of 45 down-regulated proteins, those involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism predominated. A STRING network analysis revealed tight interaction of proteins within the apoptosis, stress response and protein synthesis pathways. We short-listed a common set of 30 proteins that can be implicated in cellular pathology of CHIKV infection by comparing our results and results of earlier CHIKV proteomics studies. Modulation of eight proteins selected from this set was re-confirmed at transcript level. One among them, Nucleophosmin, a nuclear chaperone, showed temporal modulation and cytoplasmic aggregation upon CHIKV infection in double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. The short-listed cellular proteins will be potential candidates for targeted study of the molecular interactions of CHIKV with host cells. Biological significance Chikungunya remained as a neglected tropical disease till its re-emergence in 2005 in the La RéUnion islands and subsequently, in India and many parts of South East Asia. These and the epidemics that followed in subsequent years ran an explosive course leading to extreme morbidity and attributed mortality to this originally benign virus infection. Apart from classical symptoms of acute fever and debilitating polyarthralgia lasting for several weeks, a number of complications were documented. These included aphthous-like ulcers and vesiculo-bullous eruptions on the skin, hepatic involvement, central nervous system complications such as encephalopathy and encephalitis, and transplacental transmission. The disease has recently spread to the Americas with its initial documentation in the Caribbean islands. The Asian genotype of this positive-stranded RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus has been attributed in these outbreaks. However, the disease ran a similar course as the one caused by the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype in the other parts of the world. Studies have documented a number of mutations in the re-emerging strains of the virus that enhances mosquito adaptability and modulates virus infectivity. This might support the occurrence of fiery outbreaks in the absence of herd immunity in affected population. Several research groups work to understand the pathogenesis of chikungunya and the mechanisms of complications using cellular and animal models. A few proteomics approaches have been employed earlier to understand the protein level changes in the infected cells. Our present study, which couples a high throughput proteomic analysis and a comparative review of these earlier studies, identifies a few critical molecules as hypothetical candidates that might be important in this infection and for future study.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e1b111abe17b54f219c8aeb2e7916cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14123f99b24fd3e955a5674a415098c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1998d4966afd85003247f29dc58485be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c15ba59f94bbe3cca3630bde0433d62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23f52f515776cbbb83cb2b20950209c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a581bc9846aca9851a12199b6aa2035, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d7587554c82c9e583ef97cb0705c873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3193fcee9343813c51f7cbe98f018cee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d8f334db224d3217a0cef4e33a6f7da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47e407d50f35c9bd4d6546007c516b7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b31aceda52644cef6f51d34499209d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fdbc8c953a97458582213326dae28af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/513fc44a485b574972fd1664fd6011cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/590092cd3a4e0116ab3761f858bcc4e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b0fa2b3418a6f2cc3b152bc59269c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f46fa0b02b67657c4625e0f32b0e6ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/642cbebb74d078b4f8b7212308385c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66ab1639f687c85a130a20ac8fc95276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69026830122313d4d40dd81b230cbae6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6abc92a4e350762d5f2a61bd40c1b099, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70ed939de7df3f0bf0904dece7c3e1b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/719bb42f633c080474d07998814f91ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88cc8e53421f3cc02c84395a75dc6d30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8da561a3392ab6936efc72726203c8b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9228681b4b445b7b27c95b949db0e7ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929a89fdcca44457bef53b7ace1c0cad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97acdd138b36dfddf6c4a14040731285, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c04352d1585fd56dba4db027e713884, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cfbb7a7b1f32e48b96d9afcc6a82ddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4e5b0b188cd6206f5a2c7d24f0c9d4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4135bb62b0cdb43adccb72ab97a58d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5108004a4fc926c9023d6676fe8f754, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b564dc5ba1a0c9a87508055432ea7fb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb23fb53f2754ff2a53dc6e15effe67d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd506c758245fcbf738b4d15420aa907, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bea92b407943a534f5cbd36f73847385, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c132134f92cb2da0006982b1d95302e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c94ef0606c3db0377773a3a44bda89b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3c119f3837ac4c70c562476c1264ff5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5069d5b4b91ecfcb3bc42f2fb118821, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d56693c70b2534dfd7d7aa4fd7195829, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed8c548e24c1389ce99703a3c4257888, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb49f44de882a5bc960565ff13d5d547"

To investigate the immunopathogenesis and viral genetic determinants responsible for the induction of immunodeficiency disease in vivo, we have generated chimeras between the two major viral genomes in the original virus isolate, designated common form clone 61E and major variant clone 61C, which were molecularly cloned directly from DNA of the same animal and tissue. Each of three 61E/C chimeras, containing at minimum a 34-amino-acid segment (including a 6-amino-acid insertion and one amino acid substitution) near the C terminus of the 61C surface glycoprotein (gp70), induced fatal immunodeficiency disease in all (12 of 12) infected animals over a course of 33 +/- 10 weeks. By contrast, animals infected with virus 61E, although persistently antigenemic, remained asymptomatic throughout a 48-week observation period. Beginning 14 weeks after infection, a significant decrease (8 to 10%) in the percent of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes developed in the 61E/C chimera-infected cats, compared with either 61E-infected or control animals. At this time, no significant changes were seen in CD8 cells, B cells, or mitogen-induced blastogenesis. Prior to this initial decline in CD4 cells, the ability of all antigenemic 61E/C-infected cats to generate a primary antibody response to the T-cell-dependent antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin was markedly impaired, whereas all 61E-infected cats, one 61E/C-infected but nonviremic cat, and all uninfected control cats produced normal antibody responses. The results reported here demonstrate that a major determinant of in vivo immunodeficiency induction by FeLV-FAIDS is contained within a 34-amino-acid C-terminal segment of its surface glycoprotein and that this gp70 alteration determines the early and persistent deficits in CD4+ T lymphocytes and T-cell-dependent antibody responses. We hypothesize that these early immunologic alterations could result from early deletion of a CD4+ helper T-cell subset.",""

Hygienic practices that have reduced exposure of the immune system to such agents include the use of modern toiletry, disposable diapers and clothes dryers. Historically, the anal region was cleansed following defecation with natural materials that would have brought antigens and infectious agents from the environment into frequent contact with the perianal skin and anal mucosa. This practice was a crude form of transcutaneous and mucosal vaccination, whereby antigenic agents that are topically applied to skin or mucosal surfaces, penetrate into the tissues and stimulate immune responses that can extend to the respiratory tract. Furthermore, until the 1960s, diapers and other cloth items were often dried outdoors where they would have collected environmental antigens that, when applied to the body, could have made contact with the immune system in the skin. Herein, it is hypothesized that prevention of allergic rhinitis and possibly other disorders involving the immune system could be achieved by the daily application of preparations composed of environmental antigens and infectious agents to the anal mucosa and adjacent skin. In support of the proposal, immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis currently involves administration of specific allergens to subcutaneous tissue or to the sublingual mucosa. It is considered that superior protection could be achieved by applying the allergens to the anal region where they would target the immune system in both mucosal tissue and adjacent skin. It is also hypothesized that respiratory viruses applied to the anal region would infect tissues at that site and induce immune responses that would protect the respiratory tract against the common cold and influenza. This approach is supported by evidence that orally administered adenovirus vaccine can induce an infection in the intestinal mucosa that stimulates immunity to protect the respiratory tract. Although other respiratory viruses are unlikely to survive passage through the intestinal tract, rhinovirus has on rare occasion been detected in stool specimens, suggesting the possibility of an infection at the terminal end of the digestive tract. Respiratory syncytial viruses and influenza viruses are amenable to modification by reverse genetics and other techniques and it is expected that natural or modified viruses applied to the anal region could serve to immunize the respiratory tract.",""

Seventy-two cases had an isolate matching the nationally unique whole genome sequencing profile (single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) address: 1.1.1.124.395.395). Interviews established exposure to the restaurant and subsequent case–control analysis identified an association with eating carvery buffet food (adjusted odds ratios (AOR): 20.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2 – ∞). Environmental inspections, food/water testing, and a food trace-back investigation were inconclusive. Repeated cycles of cleaning were undertaken, including hydrogen peroxide fogging, however, transmission continued. After 7 months of investigation, environmental swabbing identified 106 isolates from kitchen surfaces and restaurant drains matching the outbreak profile. We found structural faults with the drainage system and hypothesised that a reservoir of bacteria in drain biofilm and underfloor flooded areas may have sustained this outbreak. Ineffective drain water-traps (U-bends) may have also contributed by allowing transmission of contaminated aerosols into the kitchen environment. These findings suggest that routine swabbing of sink drain points and inspection of drainage systems should be considered in future outbreak scenarios.",""

The molecular mechanisms that govern enhanced susceptibility of elderly populations are not known, and robust animal models are needed that recapitulate the increased pathogenic phenotype noted with increasing age. Using synthetic biology and reverse genetics, we describe the construction of a panel of isogenic SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains bearing variant spike glycoproteins that are representative of zoonotic strains found in palm civets and raccoon dogs, as well as isolates spanning the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS-CoV epidemic. The recombinant viruses replicated efficiently in cell culture and demonstrated variable sensitivities to neutralization with antibodies. The human but not the zoonotic variants replicated efficiently in human airway epithelial cultures, supporting earlier hypotheses that zoonotic isolates are less pathogenic in humans but can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. All viruses replicated efficiently, but none produced clinical disease or death in young animals. In contrast, severe clinical disease, diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline membrane formation, alveolitis, and death were noted in 12-month-old mice inoculated with the palm civet HC/SZ/61/03 strain or early-human-phase GZ02 variants but not with related middle- and late-phase epidemic or raccoon dog strains. This panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing zoonotic and human epidemic spike glycoproteins will provide heterologous challenge models for testing vaccine efficacy against zoonotic reintroductions as well as provide the appropriate model system for elucidating the complex virus-host interactions that contribute to more-severe and fatal SARS-CoV disease and acute respiratory distress in the elderly.",""

As resistance traits are difficult or impossible to measure directly, potential indirect criteria are measures of immune traits (ITs). Our underlying hypothesis is that levels of ITs with no focus on specific pathogens define an individual's immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general. Since variation in ITs depends on genetic, environmental and probably epigenetic factors, our aim was to estimate the relative importance of genetics. In this report, we present a large genetic survey of innate and adaptive ITs in pig families bred in the same environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fifty four ITs were studied on 443 Large White pigs vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and analyzed by combining a principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic parameter estimation. ITs include specific and non specific antibodies, seric inflammatory proteins, cell subsets by hemogram and flow cytometry, ex vivo production of cytokines (IFNα, TNFα, IL6, IL8, IL12, IFNγ, IL2, IL4, IL10), phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. While six ITs had heritabilities that were weak or not significantly different from zero, 18 and 30 ITs had moderate (0.1<h2≤0.4) or high (h2>0.4) heritability values, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between ITs were weak except for a few traits that mostly include cell subsets. PCA revealed no cluster of innate or adaptive ITs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that variation in many innate and adaptive ITs is genetically controlled in swine, as already reported for a smaller number of traits by other laboratories. A limited redundancy of the traits was also observed confirming the high degree of complementarity between innate and adaptive ITs. Our data provide a genetic framework for choosing ITs to be included as selection criteria in multitrait selection programmes that aim to improve both production and health traits.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/404b568a7c16deb051c47bc6299e273e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44f9adb33be7fe804ddbf48c49ecd9ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f7d8f1eaf4c1d23dbaa2279f4f87d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fb557f2e5161b6eb6002468df98805b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81b9f7a287fb71c1e037e1c08827ef63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/923bce6ef399d11b60fa0b938ed606ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acecfec85cac0e38edb0180fdb80c5d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d76b36d8023f8f6f0ecde146054e5c51"

The complement system is involved in atherogenesis, and the complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role facilitating the clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. Limited evidence suggests that CR1 may be involved in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the relationship between CR1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk. Methods Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region (n = 73) on chromosome 1 were assessed in 5244 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age, country and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease. Results All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. In this region, strong LD was present leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (all p < 0.05). Moreover, most of the associated SNPs were also associated with levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected. Conclusions These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated with inflammation and the risk of incident coronary artery disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06497beb7bf2e3662dfb5a406dd82642, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0654eaed353f1b8f6d4167a786bb71ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c8a51c47e83ec1efc005b6384debdd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1367cd11212a86bb26cdfa5b96890984, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19995877532d7a793df7946a50e7eea9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ccd519ee035b2e5f6837085a8e0495c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/242b7db9c941d393df3f7ef0cffccfeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25576b7b88d1742600bb6555e15f33a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28586675c7a3a528874c07fe8db597be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/292942d536df351af71db90e664ee832, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3155155a7535fcdcd4b8eb925ee919f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43b79d35fa58e94726988b20d9eb8360, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43dea50e3787bc2a5600aea4c57097fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44ae0cdbc586aca05442030e5db09177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/474e913be538ed799f8eade569ecf8a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a110c7ba7ec467fbfce6ff5b3cfd3d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ea915116a16ef192669fcb9b566f92a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f3a467dd2e06a8bad30bad84de6278a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52c86a8f928313fa3173edb9c5d0ba72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53368798d8da3b74cb7316c4075d7172, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d3ad46730014a9d3fac9dae4a934553, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e5253dcb00acf9ebc93a997418ea562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f0cde222514e90269e96e2e9903a956, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70cdc4f848cf1ba0f9423732eaf85f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/730cf4bafb71ed7ea9165861a11a057d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e784445408e6a85ee1ce08f7e2b0842, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8163bd417916d7ded6eba287f673121d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d0e144218d8626ecea485d76b7c859f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/909e110bc4a57f9b36117821040b99fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f26f85eb885c788829e1fe3e4c7121f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f3966e8bb24afbee578d7014189960b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acbf18e7891a053a70c6e178eee9beb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad2c5e4dc5c28b2f93ee98ad2dd9d06b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b46582490687fe45c3d39f42ee22e5c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc6d3d9fb4909c6f42dd48fd8a5ba915, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd7f930680fe9ad1c16fee1c23726f83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c68b227fa4995332fd9f4f237bbcfb7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca08d82b450d3be9d4c9d93278a03ad8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cccd35361dd774aee5e1117534b4262e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d08fe45b06e1da839cea51d38fd40dfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d72cb61de24f5472df57e1e7fa732086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e671e0eeba442b1086a6b6711fc2f3e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed9a0c9a8bc667c95b0d9b9b7355cadb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f13c1771af208552c213bfb2fc44f956, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f43472c738c245414c22ab2a41514707"

Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.",""

Together these features provide a structural basis for the hypothesis that M2 has a proton translocation function capable of regulating the pH of vesicles of the trans-Golgi network, a role important in promoting the correct maturation of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/146dfd545c520d338696d5b0b1070c37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5640b1e1eacf88a0bb2cd6c465572ec7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57e4cbaf4b254fd0ad3f4815410b30c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5858f8e39108723cf7d2e798aaeddea5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6132f9796ca9bf4ddf3267124b9183ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7210faa019372569661e15d68e5a2499, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75786c4ae0d2cfa3c1d40b237f464bfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e87647e4c6f2552d609e31c1724ed98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b139adb995701d064f2c1360c7985f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bf662250452e71c355e70de2016db7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f59850e0df9ef19404398900665bb6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adeae0c6c6aa965b6d0e4a9bf86eea00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2e33c380b378f28d466dbca7cc43709, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc48175a384a6ffa738e7fbd324ac64f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddf9d357f0e7e76016cb53d8e0ad99c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dec4258c01d2235c9aea1df3449262f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0e8223d48ead6d0b6fbd6314c0bff40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee1ea6762ee47fd7c26254be996b0f0d"

Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) reduces rotavirus infection and diarrhea. However, the molecular mechanisms of LGG-mediated protection from rotavirus infection are poorly understood. Autophagy plays an essential role in responses to microbial pathogens. However, the role of autophagy in HRV infection and LGG treatment is unknown. We hypothesize that rotavirus gastroenteritis activates autophagy and that LGG suppresses virus-induced autophagy and prevents intestinal damage in infected piglets. METHODS: We used LGG feeding to combat viral gastroenteritis in the gnotobiotic pig model of virulent HRV infection. RESULTS: We found that LGG feeding did not increase autophagy, whereas virus infection induced autophagy in the piglet intestine. Virus infection increased the protein levels of the autophagy markers ATG16L1 and Beclin-1 and the autophagy regulator mTOR. LGG treatment during viral gastroenteritis reduced autophagy marker expression to normal levels, induced apoptosis and partially prevented virus-induced tissue damage. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into virus-induced autophagy and LGG suppression of uncontrolled autophagy and intestinal injury. A better understanding of the antiviral activity of LGG will lead to novel therapeutic strategies for infant infectious diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/135c5b7d92affe859c9df9782ee03928, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d11850266aa3acd770ef8f730c6dc42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/381e6d5892fee5a8de20767ec511f60b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4547901a8680dc9a46ae7804e978d0f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c833a62cfa1be8b6d8325e21cecc3e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/567b3da30de0fedec486a87c1e0edfe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/607da1c610a58ac573782ab36d8c0d7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6947c72ddc0417c7a70dfd3795d054be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71101585226ca9bae37b7a84a083bbce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72afeb08c58a1e395dd0eef61083a816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c5892628132f89e0aff3fd1cd7e680a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/918f120003a605dce667ad2986bb3dd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96f2ef3baaccc4a87c1a44f57de30805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/973b5ed4b573c11b02f768a1a959807c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a32810b7a3d66421d9c30f0877e619cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a70e378a52707241d17810ea4d7df2ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b36650673fae6bd73cfbd5a8ba3ab801, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c35273641ba887f93587fe5cb64e7902, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c58082869e014076d23820df1ef8f85f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca7f60ee178445e01c1c68be66d3da12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d365ec4c93c940edc797d0e58b5c63de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e690463cc5e9ba9860c19e455a0ac411, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed519e3cf0edea8f217246904c850166, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f320ac666e44b640567d2f9ccdc9fd62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f675a65a7625849be94279b91340c765"

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues (https://academia.nferx.com/). Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (α-coronavirus). This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2686b9b1ec29790e7fb164e4cd7944c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/273ff37100eb151f2db1856a614094e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27bffdd8f2ce50898548ec7cfa43000a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fffb83adcc3a1802df0fde1e122ba00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34107cae3469f725812748973d982c32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39e414c85330ab991ae52e23962f984a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d5fb4ba8ee6ead16257af561cedbeb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ff5c91f09c403a33f6e4d3afecdf309, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/407a3814dd8b205a0ab55b4a9d339ca3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49532b81517f9de60110a8c142413699, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e8c178540ff0fc509d1875ef3a26938, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e3bcaf62d9c78396b120aad00faaac7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65ba70aa024b047a82861767c740d790, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/771fbf8638cbddea69645e1d034a073d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c69206efecbe7851fb2962daa208795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a5ac604b300c7a12f898c404efdd9e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c81b78dde446f2b7c71a9817695ca3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c540c36b752ddb2ab89b505f82121fff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c97c22a75cd0c5cd9fb896d104565055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e70a125ca07e9584dac290ad7075306d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e78f0cc9e69be7704ab52db9eb5a5c1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebde1131537a67b1523794d6affe118d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6254d4be1caec3f82468b7eeee89532, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f65d7027513620690dc6ece96e53362f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fba11c3942119f1aa81f91cde6f8cfc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fccbec33a0904304b5d5e88f47f8078a"

Previous work has shown that systemic immunization against adenovirus after vector delivery to the brain results in complete loss of brain cells infected by adenoviral vectors. Although T cells play an important role in this process, we demonstrate herein that B cells also significantly regulate transgene expression from the CNS. After the systemic immunization against adenovirus of animals injected via the brain with an adenoviral vector 30 days earlier, we uncovered substantial infiltration by CD19(+) B cells of the area of the brain transduced by the virus. This suggests the involvement of B cells in the adaptive immune response-mediated loss of transduced cells from the brain. Confocal analysis of these brains demonstrated physical contacts between transduced brain cells and CD19(+) cells. To test the hypothesis that B cells play a causal role in the loss of infected cells from the brain, we demonstrated that animals devoid of B cells were unable to eliminate transgene expression at early time points after immunization. This demonstrates that B cells play a necessary role in the loss of transgene expression at early, but not late, time points postimmunization. Thus, these data have important implications for our understanding of the role of B cells as immune effectors during the immune-mediated clearance of viral infections from the CNS, and also for understanding mechanisms operating in brain autoimmunity, as well as for the potential safety of clinical gene therapy for brain diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0836a41734e234f2f1df845d80c8cba1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1076d35637f7aae0ed67416e09d14cb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15899fb235805a2cc685b4e4b6465d8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fe1c1a2c96ca1990c1d271b97130175, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2573865e3cbe997ea36e8e5372d67fe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/262c233695faf7970a87b7eccea2c756, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35e832dd1f8fefe09d0c3e388c1b0e5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a58963fd98fa800df0ebe1f9d3c5106, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a8b847684c313c7abfbde49fbd7f5f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c8789a4633b7d96dcdf03667b0cdae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54155dcea5b4467f3d59416544ed15c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59e61f3baec0e1ba9cf68054354f7b17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/638a92a5630deb077a8fd628317fed92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79adc27b75c47671047481909924304e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a4a1c219bdbcd3c40761cbc7ecf78d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/907bd0bad805aec76ff986f01c36d647, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97f68e5cc5c016212aa9832647d072d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c6ba106353ad86f923ae4078f5645fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab10bc2de945be51bd294e998b19a7e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b70e98b12e30d3ce1d1233027e9a7e9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc7e963cfe91720375610117fca4b546, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c00c7456aa975527aeb543e45519524a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0e771380634cf7509f626da76c80f44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6c692fc18320ba344865204c564c7aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc00e5c4820ca0de9c45f0cd35a610c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf57cd27c1c37e3c0033924b264935c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d82c7031894a4f57770171c3333d3c02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ded9c5e4f8f4b8984c00e9e2dcff1141, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e71a8abd561eae950bea37f18165db93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f146aca69c45176e5dd0de8e3bdb0839, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f33648e39810a4e3b09359c0cc436b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f760db8fcbccddaa69a744f8b3671a0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff9da68e7be64c73a08d2836e2cfb6ac"

We sought to define relevant correlates of disease severity in the mouse influenza model, hypothesizing that a susceptibility threshold exists for alveolar epithelial cell loss. We compared lung pathology, virus spread, alveolar epithelial cell depletion, arterial blood oxygenation, physiological responses measured by unrestrained plethysmography, and oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production by gas analysis in mice at intervals after infection with virus strains and doses that cause mild (x31) or severe (PR/8) influenza. Both mild and severe infections showed similar degrees of lung damage and virus dissemination until day 6 after inoculation but diverged in survival outcomes from day 9. Day 6 PR/8-infected mice had normal respiratory and gas exchange functions with 10% type I cell loss. However, day 10 PR/8-infected mice had 40% type I cell loss with a concomitant drastic decreases in tidal and minute volumes, V̇o(2), V̇co(2), and arterial blood oxygenation, compared with a maximum 3% type I cell loss for x31 on day 10 when they recovered body weight and respiratory functions. Alterations in breaths per minute, expiratory time, and metabolic rate were observed in both infections. A threshold for maintenance of proper respiratory function appears to be crossed once 10% of alveolar type I cells are lost.

In its favor, a growing number of publications report the successful discovery of new ligands, often supported by experimental affinity data and controls for artifacts. Few reports, however, actually test the underlying structural hypotheses that docking makes. To be successful and not just lucky, prospective docking must not only rank a true ligand among the top scoring compounds, it must also correctly orient the ligand so the score it receives is biophysically sound. If the correct binding pose is not predicted, a skeptic might well infer that the discovery was serendipitous. Surveying over 15 years of the docking literature, we were surprised to discover how rarely sufficient evidence is presented to establish whether docking actually worked for the right reasons. The paucity of experimental tests of theoretically predicted poses undermines confidence in a technique that has otherwise become widely accepted. Of course, solving a crystal structure is not always possible, and even when it is, it can be a lot of work, and is not readily accessible to all groups. Even when a structure can be determined, investigators may prefer to gloss over an erroneous structural prediction to better focus on their discovery. Still, the absence of a direct test of theory by experiment is a loss for method developers seeking to understand and improve docking methods. We hope this review will motivate investigators to solve structures and compare them with their predictions whenever possible, to advance the field.",""

Generic probiotic therapies have shown promise, but seem to lack specificity. We hypothesised that healthy children with no history of AOM carry protective commensal bacteria that could be translated into a specific probiotic therapy to break the cycle of re-infection. We characterised the nasopharyngeal microbiome of these children (controls) in comparison to children with rAOM (cases) to identify potentially protective bacteria. As some children with rAOM do not appear to carry any of the known otopathogens, we also hypothesised that characterisation of the middle ear microbiome could identify novel otopathogens, which may also guide the development of more effective therapies. RESULTS: Middle ear fluids, middle ear rinses and ear canal swabs from the cases and nasopharyngeal swabs from both groups underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The nasopharyngeal microbiomes of cases and controls were distinct. We observed a significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum in the nasopharynx of controls. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella were abundant in the middle ear and ear canal of cases, but were uncommon in the nasopharynx of both groups. Gemella and Neisseria were characteristic of the case nasopharynx, but were not prevalent in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are characteristic of a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella are possible novel otopathogens, though their rarity in the nasopharynx and prevalence in the ear canal means that their role as normal aural flora cannot be ruled out. Gemella and Neisseria are unlikely to be novel otopathogens as they do not appear to colonise the middle ear in children with rAOM.

Frameshifting permits expression of more than one polypeptide from an otherwise monocistronic mRNA, and can restore expression of polypeptides in the face of frameshift mutations. A common mutation conferring acyclovir resistance in patients with herpes simplex virus disease deletes one cytosine from a run of six cytosines (C-chord) in the viral thymidine kinase (tk) gene. However, this mutation does not abolish TK activity, which is important for pathogenicity. To investigate how this mutant retains TK activity, we engineered and analyzed viruses expressing epitope-tagged TK. We found that the mutant's TK activity can be accounted for by low levels of full-length TK polypeptide produced by net −1 frameshifting during translation. The efficiency of frameshifting was relatively high, 3–5%, as the polypeptide from the reading frame generated by the deletion, which lacks stop codons (nonstop), was poorly expressed mainly because of inefficient protein synthesis. Stop codons introduced into this reading frame greatly increased its expression, but greatly decreased the level of full-length TK, indicating that frameshifting is strongly stimulated by a new mechanism, nonstop mRNA, which we hypothesize involves stalling of ribosomes on the polyA tail. Mutational studies indicated that frameshifting occurs on or near the C-chord, a region lacking a canonical slippery sequence. Nonstop stimulation of frameshifting also occurred when the C-chord was replaced with a canonical slippery sequence from HIV. This mechanism thus permits biologically and clinically relevant TK synthesis, and may occur more generally.",""

Analysis of the S1 gene showed that isolate I1101/16 was genetically close to strain ck/CH/LJL/140901, which belongs to the TW I genotype (also known as lineage GI-7 based on the recent IBV classification), however the S2 gene showed genetic diversity comparing to that of S1 gene. Comparison of the genomic sequences showed that the genome of isolate I1101/16 was similar to that of strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 from the 5′ end of the genome to the 5′ end of the S2 gene and from the 5′ end of the 3a gene to the end of the genome, whereas the remaining parts of the genome sequences were more closely related to those of strain 4/91 than those of ck/CH/LJL/140901, thereby suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. SimPlot and Bootscan analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, where it showed that isolate I1101/16 arose through recombination events between ck/CH/LJL/140901- and 4/91-like viruses. Isolate I1101/16 and strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 shared identical amino acids in almost all five of their B cell epitopes, but the two viruses had a serotype relatedness value of 65, which is well below 80, i.e., the lower cutoff value for viruses of the same serotype. In addition, pathogenicity tests demonstrated that isolate I1101/16 was more pathogenic to 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens than strain ck/CH/LJL/140901, according to analysis of the clinical signs, whereas strain ck/CH/LJL/140901 exhibited prolonged replication and shedding after challenge compared with isolate I1101/16. This study did not provide evidence that recombination can directly alter the antigenicity, virulence, replication, shedding, and tissue tropism of a virus, but it did show that recombination events are likely to be major determinants of viral evolution.",""

However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) relative to MHV-ExoN(−), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e716c34924cee18117da07289c0779c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/108cb5ae7ac0ce8be7b6d0595ca56bce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17705d39abd9466edba523b8444a9338, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20c076ee59a725075e63ed5702f67b71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/256f2f460913c89b8923d9a94f9855bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a21812452a2f40ee5d1a2eab87e776e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f89cb1757e0e8740ffc50fd8440b1e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3079a2dc5a2ccf5a93e8f2061b18a4be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33f797a3df165b1cd564420c724822ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/345558ad4fec3280cf6c28e9bbc7f50e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cc4b67c4a1666253c2d7eed434a2735, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41aa3c164fdc7d87e1a2694e43624282, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cd67d26c0e0a28dca888e4e701ef142, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/838adae03d248901a2702dfe009220a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8393a649f0a16edd8fd83380276f4bf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9067f916f72f4b81babac0545d4552b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97e44cca8503d4726916c62e443519a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4c0aff98dbfa1542ed75eb101b46aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5546f2d5c44c204c34fbd0b52facc00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b78cfbcabdee7b440307aee41225623c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bce6e7b0ca2991a367a1f22d0ecac927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd539814315f91679f8b3e1beb103c32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2f4f78a6db415c2d209046ed0b34511, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3bddfda9010b9f2d3ee991eae5f6344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca6d4550878004760f09d0d18e7dfca2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd4b990ac6764d7c14e8f9feaaf9ea84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7c7e80bb1c37affccf03a7f49e700d1"

We hypothesized that comprehensive national data on ICU resources would permit a better understanding of regional differences in system capacity. METHODS: After the 2009–2010 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group surveyed all acute care hospitals in Canada to assess ICU capacity. Using a structured survey tool administered to physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses, we determined the number of ICU beds, ventilators, and the ability to provide specialized support for respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 286 hospitals with 3170 ICU beds and 4982 mechanical ventilators for critically ill patients. Twenty-two hospitals had an ICU that routinely cared for children; 15 had dedicated pediatric ICUs. Per 100,000 population, there was substantial variability in provincial capacity, with a mean of 0.9 hospitals with ICUs (provincial range 0.4-2.8), 10 ICU beds capable of providing mechanical ventilation (provincial range 6–19), and 15 invasive mechanical ventilators (provincial range 10–24). There was only moderate correlation between ventilation capacity and population size (coefficient of determination (R(2)) = 0.771). CONCLUSION: ICU resources vary widely across Canadian provinces, and during times of increased demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically ill patients. These results highlight the need to evolve inter-jurisdictional resource sharing during periods of substantial increase in demand, and provide background data for the development of appropriate critical care capacity benchmarks.

However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e917077a430cd3a874c583fb90eb01a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/103a97b787f45cb77ad0425cdd0f1eb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16ad3286babefa9ca99dc8da44f4ec64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1831dda289559aab21e2d55b08191b38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fc848e715e6ac6d0fc6bb03d1b937b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20dfbf6daa2524e583b7e2a116ec5999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2109840e4de1ce1a9517411bcca0a61e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26c7c3a1f4bdd723c67426a205d249b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2878b2329b920d4238e3c68f90b40113, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ad7292fc5564fe6abc5a0988aee3d59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d6c446c2e45bdcf47e2c228f79ba908, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33008b332b56e8fb9fe71f51316aa2f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3662a11e2c07f14a54945a0fbc5e3e61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/373f94013be338ca6b822ecb66d71f44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b02d1968870cdb14d3a455a0b7bf1b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3de975d564d59abceb5f8b143880a770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f57ce7c5b5f98d5fcd2d008cb4e98d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43f9db6102274dd67fbca3f444431207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4597cf560c9992574734dcd29a46daeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46f13d3d6fd38f76da08ffe4ae5f11b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54fe822f1da7cdc5e54de5eb01dd9b79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b942882234d321aba91b95464be90c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5efccb6cb887b82f42deeb88c83a445a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f9ccdbba71c2a61a306348547829c83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ff2e0ad79b641766c05689b6f8548d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/640c88415715541c57e1e522224afc2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65d433340f96c62775baf1b41e4bbb76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/698d12791ed11068b2cabb94041c3efc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c5fbb735f8f858148e8936153c4910a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7337ab7209edb3e59d94e0e809b5c106, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74ba833d1ce84ce87569abccf4c6aba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/769ef15cc517fa2c5e55d1382b806367, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89f0b439b8da1320d319ee90e21cb691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c796b3257d0759a3eff8435260c0aab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cb29521d980e443cd1be82ee3a8de9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9469b4e8406e57ea20642bee748f9b88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9887aecccb5de99b152d849c58cf2c62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd640613dc019a3307b97ae1cbeeae2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a89be9cdb5906ad7f4544dcd15583854, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9e811bff9d015f4ca222a8fd2b9a130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abe7f602e71cb85c9ef113d1fa08f726, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5389d62d58acafe16dc8441478fe735, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b735f094548b08e0d77f43bd8736cb25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b99628952cdb74a45dfbfafe79a0bd9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb6b5e718a6b4314441799407d178c29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdedfeac6e02f7bbf9a9c7302e2bd179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be8600b756187a4db89384ccfac56148, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0bc651bf1ccbf95bcc0880dd53d0167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c34490091b8400d1088768640b0fd719, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8f41c4adae556fb29d735808cb9b9b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce9216231f8d84b59aab3fced4a807de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1e964c4a33f977fa4bbc1535142360c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea179cff353a5b7b07812c23e21aa779, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecf62378ab86ccd396aabbc4d35f7e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed3a703328d0a7d03853328d0f994b05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f47bed17762e69cac4a5368abc788dcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f65cee94956bc6b91213d2e87ef74959, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf61c21e08a049eb12dd448989ee404, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fec36fd97d54049d1d4a4c151967a17b"

We previously showed that HMPV binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and that HMPV binding requires only the viral fusion (F) protein. To characterize the features of this interaction critical for HMPV binding and the role of this interaction in infection in relevant models, we utilized sulfated polysaccharides, heparan sulfate mimetics, and occluding compounds. Iota-carrageenan demonstrated potent anti-HMPV activity by inhibiting binding to lung cells mediated by the F protein. Furthermore, analysis of a minilibrary of variably sulfated derivatives of Escherichia coli K5 polysaccharide mimicking the HS structure revealed that the highly O-sulfated K5 polysaccharides inhibited HMPV infection, identifying a potential feature of HS critical for HMPV binding. The peptide dendrimer SB105-A10, which binds HS, reduced binding and infection in an F-dependent manner, suggesting that occlusion of HS at the target cell surface is sufficient to prevent infection. HMPV infection was also inhibited by these compounds during apical infection of polarized airway tissues, suggesting that these interactions take place during HMPV infection in a physiologically relevant model. These results reveal key features of the interaction between HMPV and HS, supporting the hypothesis that apical HS in the airway serves as a binding factor during infection, and HS modulating compounds may serve as a platform for potential antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a paramyxovirus that causes respiratory disease worldwide. It has been previously shown that HMPV requires binding to heparan sulfate on the surfaces of target cells for attachment and infection. In this study, we characterize the key features of this binding interaction using heparan sulfate mimetics, identify an important sulfate modification, and demonstrate that these interactions occur at the apical surface of polarized airway tissues. These findings provide insights into the initial binding step of HMPV infection that has potential for antiviral development.",""

Drug development by pharmaceutical companies is a market-driven and costly endeavor, and thus it is often a challenge when drugs are needed for diseases endemic only to certain regions or which affect only a few patients. However, biomedical open data is accessible and reusable for reanalysis and generation of a new hypotheses and discovery. In this study, we leverage biomedical data and tools to analyze available data on Nipah Virus (NiV) infection. NiV infection is an emerging zoonosis that is transmissible to humans and is associated with high mortality rates. In this study, explored the application of computational drug repositioning and chemogenomic enrichment analyses using host transcriptome data to match drugs that could reverse the virus-induced gene signature. We performed analyses using two gene signatures: i) A previously published gene signature (n=34), and ii) a gene signature generated using the characteristic direction method (n= 5,533). Our predictive framework suggests that several drugs including FDA approved therapies like beclometasone, trihexyphenidyl, S-propranolol etc. could modulate the NiV infection induced gene signatures in endothelial cells. A target specific analysis of CXCL10 also suggests the potential application of Eldelumab, an investigative therapy for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, as a putative candidate for drug repositioning. To conclude, we also discuss challenges and opportunities in clinical trials (n-of-1 and adaptive trials) for repositioned drugs. Further follow-up studies including biochemical assays and clinical trials are required to identify effective therapies for clinical use. Our proof-of-concept study highlights that translational bioinformatics methods including gene expression analyses and computational drug repositioning could augment epidemiological investigations in the context of an emerging disease with no effective treatment.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72091c980625b0d25b3a178695febe21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86f23865ec157ade9b309d9e54584f26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0e86a75765873fe88afa463c223b854, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0e33c9dab6407cc692a1f92ccc97846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d211f173ea2be7ed4f5c9b26aa9b9eb4"

Expression of lncRNAs increased substantially following the progression of the infection. Among 645 significantly expressed lncRNAs, the expression of 398 was changed more than 2-fold. More than 80% of them were up-regulated and 80% of them were detected during the late phase. Based on the genomic locations of the deregulated lncRNAs in relation to known mRNAs and miRNAs, they were predicted to be involved in growth, structure, apoptosis and wound healing in the early phase, cell proliferation in the intermediate phase and protein synthesis, modification and transport in the late phase. The most significant functions of cellular RNA-binding proteins, previously shown to interact with the deregulated lncRNAs identified here, are involved in RNA splicing, nuclear export and translation events.

Some investigators have expressed concern that changing to solid-bottom cages would interfere with technicians' ability to detect clinical signs. To test this hypothesis, rats were housed in both types of caging and given compounds to induce a variety of subtle clinical signs common to toxicology studies including chromodacryorrhea, soft stool, stereotypic behaviors, mild hypoactivity, abnormal postures, and discolored urine. For one comparison, fecal pellets were removed to simulate decreased production of feces. Technicians, blinded from knowing which animals had been treated, observed the rats and recorded the clinical signs they detected. The technicians who administered the treatments verified that clinical signs were present before and after the blinded technicians made their observations. The number of animals observed with clinical signs divided by the number of animals verified with signs was calculated for each compound and compared between the cage types by using the Fisher Exact Test. The only statistically significant difference observed was a diminished ability to detect discolored, dark urine from rats in wire-bottom cages.

Identifying the underlying cause(s) of such waves may help manage future pandemics. We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’. We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing that occurred during the course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38%, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R(0), was estimated to be in the range of 1.6–2.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R(0), implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection. This reduction in the clinical attack rate translates to an estimated 260 per 100 000 lives having been saved, and suggests that social distancing interventions could play a major role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ba65e0a8c59dc424a3c5dc8caa2d5d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/278f5240715cf40c01facd5b5b7eb916, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c0db5ae8af76eb9c28e8e6277a53adc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32e4aa3ac86935ac3a3aa41ead08ab31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4258abef5e5cac6d4458c325455e17f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/429ee4a2edf92e4fdd58db31f43ffefb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43b521cd3c84929a377e10b86589d541, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58dbb84456186cbfd0b347052c8928be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6eb6a97d9ce1c13fd0aa05a9431d58f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fefdbacf6078d0e687bb4f7ad1018b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f3b1811d9b3160f5107c15ac1ff6fe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/800fdcc8f746c53bdcd25269107bc8f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a4ffe5a0bfdc20b71b68c5ccfb83501, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f7d6ef41223b3270cf65e23d759a326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c008272ad85af38070b8dd888ecb64d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b25faba2893c16953933f5853104a4cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2beb506480f5888a9aaf70c021c71a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfec6c0cc2b24e07db24f612aa3b7972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cde0f4b20fb8a802294347f730363deb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d29bee87f213e4d81b2bf23ac923cb42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df0596af844b4b12f2b02b0fc42a5289, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df806fa1633fd3f6cbe5a97e66f89d81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7b7bc2f24a54eae827298939aed64e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe071346981344ddcc02971328110fa9"

However, despite evidence that laryngoscope handles could be a source of nosocomial infection, neither our institution nor the American Society of Anesthesiologists has any specific guidelines for handle disinfection. We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols. METHODS: Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination. Of these positive cultures, 25 (62.5%) yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci, seven (17.5%) Bacillus spp. not anthracis, three (7.5%) α-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and one each (2.5%) of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Corynebacterium spp. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Gram-negative rods were detected. All viral tests were negative. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of bacterial contamination of laryngoscope handles despite low-level disinfection. However, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, or respiratory viruses were detected. Our results support adoption of guidelines that include, at a minimum, mandatory low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles after each patient use.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1890e78ee91d5db9b170f101a379766f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/404c5a373fb1e09a06035267f0b91d3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/412979bac8910be7ec31d4f46608600e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a79d15b9ff93072d54b4a4def1541b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c9e8df110f375b7af78e4be2107387d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eee37614425df8ae59fbce0de5d1f1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99830c572d6b53b03d4d30d32e907f8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2e216b74b3aab09fa7a7cdf94fd4e48"

Modeling this within rhesus macaques is complicated because human adenoviruses, including human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-5), are not endogenous to macaques. Here, we tested whether vaccination with a rhesus macaque-derived adenoviral vector (simian adenovirus 7 [SAdV-7]) enhances mucosal T cell activation within rhesus macaques. Following intramuscular SAdV-7 vaccination, we observed a pronounced increase in SAdV-7-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in peripheral blood and, more dramatically, in rectal mucosa tissue. Vaccination also induced a significant increase in the frequency of activated memory CD4(+) T cells in SAdV-7- and HAdV-5-vaccinated animals in the rectal mucosa but not in peripheral blood. These fluctuations within the rectal mucosa were also associated with a pronounced decrease in the relative frequency of naive resting CD4(+) T cells. Together, these results indicate that peripheral vaccination with an AdV vector can increase the activation of mucosal CD4(+) T cells, potentially providing an experimental model to further evaluate the role of host-vector interactions in increased HIV acquisition after AdV vector vaccination. IMPORTANCE The possibility that vaccination with a human adenovirus 5 vector increased mucosal T cell activation remains a central hypothesis to explain the potential enhancement of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition within the Step trial. In this study, we tested whether vaccination with a rhesus macaque-derived adenoviral vector in rhesus macaques enhances mucosal CD4(+) T cell activation, the main cell target of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV. The results showed that vaccination with an adenoviral vector indeed increases activation of mucosal CD4(+) T cells and potentially increases susceptibility to SIV infection.",""

A thorough understanding of the multiple capsid properties at the molecular level is required in order to identify potential targets for antiviral therapy and the prevention of viral disease. The system we have chosen for study are the astroviruses, a family of icosahedral, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause disease in mammals and birds. Very little is known about what regions of the coat protein contribute to the diverse capsid functions. This review will present novel structural predictions for the coat protein sequence of different astrovirus family members. Based on these predictions, we hypothesize that the assembly and RNA packaging functions of the astrovirus coat protein constitutes an individual domain distinct from the determinants required for receptor binding and internalization. Information derived from these structural predictions will serve as an important tool in designing experiments to understand astrovirus biology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04d9ed36a808717ca539dd3c9793555f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0592aec23f07ae050b014e3764cc2be5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/080e08df8726879704dbf6baaa8aa3f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2013190d3c29ec599157aff0680ddeaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2694c739845a67420487c70ce0617dd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28d0b83592c86da6d86fb5f0873ade93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fab3f19c22bdffc97c8b0d309167a3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a536f4e8439fa9f8e32e198315aba89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4406523d5e44e0f128963f3eb9bc8ace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4da7a6b564e62eaf204cfe7d9e2ce859, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57ebe46721527e917e4856e932319e33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e8691a1352fdd0584c1004eaa0ff607, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f5bac55afa2729900bd6b702b5aa21c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68a6c9795964e7672bba7ad785308187, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72456df28aa77d84edda672dc1ba9be1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78528748a6788e622a566b3bfe00c66d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81cdecdad04efbd2a9b795ec0d97ca8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a0c631fff8ebffdb7723cc5b1ead001, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8afb81d82b85a04f73c530540a0b4e05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c8a6e500407a5598cb70e6c6967e77f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9281df058650a08179272bea92f8e2ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a121016e90bb0afe84231e8e35b0a37c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a27720dcd899991a8abd8a435d9d75d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4043e203999880c98ff6699f6928e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5209fdfc00137f16fb8cb8851f51ee1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9e2a661bb0775f42258d84e603fab40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0fb42da23e0eeb4f0eaeec0479f83ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5c8f9d18234a2fda424c56eb3d56b36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd81944f9f144ad9d47b342ce09c8faa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d01f818e0f48ac08e45fc301b793caec"

In addition, we hypothesize that changes in pH within the aerosol that are induced by evaporation may trigger conformational changes of the surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses and subsequently compromise their infectivity.

The debate involves the mode of transmission of a simian virus (SIV) to humans. Both major camps in the argument presume that humans are normally free of such viruses and assume that once the simian virus was transmitted, it immediately infected some T-cells and caused the release of toxic agents that killed off bystander (uninfected) T-cells resulting in AIDS. The evolution of the Simian virus (SIV) into a human virus (HIV) is regarded as an artifact. In contrast, a fundamentally different hypothesis has been proposed [Parris GE. Med Hypotheses 2004;62(3):354–7] in which it is presumed that in hyper-endemic areas of malaria (central Africa), all primates (humans and non-human primates) have shared a retrovirus that augments their T-cell response to the malaria parasite. The virus can be called “primate T-cell retrovirus” (PTRV). Over thousands of years the virus has crossed species lines many times (with little effect) and typically adapts to the host quickly. In this model, AIDS is seen to be the result of the development of resistance of the virus (PTRV) to continuous exposure to pro-apoptotic (schizonticidal) aminoquinoline drugs used to prevent malaria. The hypothesis was originally proposed based on biochemical activities of the aminoquinolines (e.g., pamaquine (plasmoquine(TM)), primaquine and chloroquine), but recent publications demonstrated that some of these drugs definitely adversely affect HIV and other viruses and logically would cause them to evolve resistance. Review of the timeline that has been created for the evolution of HIV in humans is also shown to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with this hypothesis (and not with either version of the conventional hypothesis). SARS and Ebola also fit this pattern.",""

Extensive metagenomic studies of different organs/tissues from bats have revealed a large number of novel or divergent viruses. To elucidate viral diversity and epidemiological and phylogenetic characteristics, six pooled fecal samples from bats were generated (based on bat species and geographic regions characteristic for virome analysis). These contained 500 fecal samples from six bat species, collected in four geographic regions. Metagenomic analysis revealed a plethora of divergent viruses originally found in bats. Multiple contigs from influenza A virus and coronaviruses in bats shared high identity with those from humans, suggesting possible cross-species transmission, whereas a number of contigs, whose sequences were taxonomically classifiable within Alphapapillomavirus, Betaretrovirus, Alpharetrovirus, Varicellovirus, Cyprinivirus, Chlorovirus and Cucumovirus had low identity to viruses in existing databases, which indicated possible evolution of novel viral species. None of the established caliciviruses and picornaviruses were found in the 500 fecal specimens. Papillomaviruses with high amino acid identity were found in Scotophilus kuhlii and Rhinolophus blythi, challenging the hypotheses regarding the strict host specificity and co-evolution of papillomaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four bat rotavirus A strains might be tentative G3 strains, according to the Rotavirus Classification Working Group classification.

In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain, we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network and rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified based on some biological hypotheses. The main result of the paper is the illustration of the link between graph automorphisms and the process of lumping whereby the number of equations in a system of linear differential equations can be significantly reduced. The main advantage of lumping is that the simplified lumped system is not an approximation of the original system but rather an exact version of this. For a special class of graphs, we show how the lumped system can be obtained by using graph automorphisms. Finally, we discuss the advantages and possible applications of exact epidemic models and lumping.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/088e696bc3591e4c0e9757b59fda9b7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2af0b9ca6cc9f4247ebbcc73ec52e147, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ffa94db735ed4ce8b73ca078e1469ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61cdf645a05bec3e92120a6b74ac1607, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82257fe455afe033a1cb85679013cfac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b35fd692daa4dcd5653e3819dfeca6b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3d64b012c75fa2f9eb660e2af52cf59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db74010ab3036ff37addfee6d1383a84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0b1d89cce35a6e8f68a3b2054d95892"

We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8(+) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8(+) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/014807ccc88d78ff55c85e39282bd685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02dda7f7279c0af9f79ba06c09c2f16e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b4c33de610845e3a2dd18239320e0c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c1628b9e27ef9e6627e9ea6a0e8cb7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/104d059f6f61211be09be5668e0e567d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16d917418fbffd792c7979eb03aa0aa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17d3507bd182ebfc756d41d7fea3236e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19b84d6b92341e1e87c0a6987d089c20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a03343ca00a1b52c093192ca90c5903, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/238bba0d3bd572a60800d3a5b72518a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268c32cc24dbaf701f242573d85f914a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27e57fcd8bbf744b9ae52e5167c9a5fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3567bf0f90c6c0d9f248c9384a29aacd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b1b4890f78a31af8e87738dbacff7b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d558088e046d07d81e46621fe81fc09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f4b03da9cf23bb603bd432ed8408614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4344671fb9bc4ec29c92979e9e6d394c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/438ca3af5db195c4ffb003a57d190507, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b0536b252013bb9edfce00f1c728478, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/680f2ca329ca1189174b5a6126ba14a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/702649da03c194abae4f0d44d7e5e77d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74affa84a6215bc83d3c3ae0be5a564d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/824e865b95ade5053138eb79022b26d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82cb25991240921c29d665318fdb3e1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a82103a864eb27ffd21a87cf00a2a30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/923fffa32caf3bc21b64df8e1cd411d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b9a527b7fd551a1dd8c01028ba46c16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cec6e28c494cb4794c54a8ed1b4f4d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ace92e8431b24afab5da5f976995c05d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8cd7d0e3ce68ac916e32e750ef51002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bccb170e728691704e09db18f94adc06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcf65e76ab4ea83f2e56a68ca86c9926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29d1e1f33a5d417e8673051629f1e60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c333dcf72e31240f6ee199d20912e799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6c1a1d7748e90d265ddbc7d9c5af3e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cab04b3711f60cd9cceb003dd4f689a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc060f1ffa34e5bbd4fc9ff9f910386d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc80ac3c4f3abb8ba412d7f60a37f79a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd4dd3bac15a18ea6292080b5da27697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3f99f6cab911c12325831ddecfb1033, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7c5f832a2f0bdc8f22728735c011d7a"

These observations were obtained by the overlay of JHMV-infected cells onto receptor-negative cells that are otherwise resistant to wt JHMV infection. MHVR-independent infection is hypothetically thought to be attributed to a naturally occurring fusion activation of the wt JHMV S protein, which did not occur in the case of srr7. Attachment of S protein on cells without MHVR during the S-protein activation process seems to be a key condition. Thus, in the present study, we tried to see whether wt JHMV virions that are attached on MHVR-negative cells are able to infect those cells. In order to make virions attach to the cell surface without MHVR, we have used spinoculation, namely, the centrifugation of cells together with inoculated virus at 3,000 rpm for 2 h. This procedure forces viruses to attach to the cell surface, as revealed by quantitative estimation of attached virions by real-time PCR and also facilitated wt JHMV infection to MHVR-negative cells, but failed to do so for srr7. Virions of both wt and srr7 attached on MHVR-negative cells by spinoculation were facilitated for infection in the presence of a soluble form of MHVR that induces conformational changes of both wt and srr7. It was further revealed that wt JHMV S1, but not srr7, was released from the cell surface when S protein was expressed on cells. These observations support the hypothesis that attachment of the virion to MHVR-negative cells is a critical step and that a unique feature of wt JHMV S1 to be released from S2 in a naturally occurring event is involved in an MHVR-independent infection.",""

We get some insight by considering demands a virus places on host cells. Viruses not only require production of their own proteins, RNA and/or DNA, but also production of additional cellular machinery, such as ribosomes, to handle the increased demands. Since the nucleolus is a major site of RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleoli are targeted by viruses, directly when viral RNA and proteins enter the nucleolus and indirectly when viruses induce increased expression of cellular polyamine genes. Polyamines are at high levels in nucleoli to assist in RNA folding. The size and activity of nucleoli increase directly with increases in polyamines. Nucleolar expansion due to abnormal increases in polyamines could disrupt nearby chromatin, such as the inactive X chromosome, leading to expression of previously sequestered DNA. Sudden expression of a large concentration of Alu elements from the disrupted inactive X can compete with RNA transcripts containing intronic Alu sequences that normally maintain nucleolar structural integrity. Such disruption of nucleolar activity can lead to misfolded RNAs, misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Many autoantigens in lupus are, at least transiently, components of the nucleolus. Considering these effects of viruses, the “X chromosome–nucleolus nexus” hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00cfe9cb3c962e34e537c1752c046231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/037c64f9c1cb61158df064024e92d7b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/056f80cd9db33ddadb911b0ca49bc5ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0991a99c1963d97d9bef3766d5cfae2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a112c5b644eaf0aca85376d646df12b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ca9a50eda40959068c4a16b7fd94425, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d41acc5385c8818099b2f3ea462f651, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10abd7f514a3e37dfb2bbc3597c2f8af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12fed7a9ee0415a5ca2f6838f744000e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15bc68f16621c63c2dd06bc3c0269aec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17113afa24306ff9676bb03b7cacc607, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e1023fedd4740f5734f589bccdaf00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bf6d288a037d403bcc1e5898eb731b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c556bbd107b983804afcc1a8da74fd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/455e1debc013439a67fa38c3c4507544, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/491b91daea457613dd690219ada6f269, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4983626d3657dff9921623460b2c00e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a096e86a2eb7f0b871ac2c95f5d112a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b62bac1a299ccb6ddc0974c277cbf4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b986cf1b80aff59feb91f7845412d33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e6f43c390c7c88f6a35fc7c0d40d9d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fa3e9998220e5413634a73b524d8144, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/505200300a2586e6832977025a61bccd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51c9dc5212ff7ed3db72d78ad037156f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/573af6ed62565c49f3d5287550224b95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5afa71c56609979d1f3b7393d8c61120, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7226fb035680b3df05dce553df40b90c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/738a6bbbdf6a1d409b7e098722168a36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78469e4768ce9d99c86aed3be2c42d61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cfa8fd876b646d8f0b46f74a820f2d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/872bc3465a3196f8cb3344b8c78cf367, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d5387fda73f2b4b9b675def49264d97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a00b563fa08be1552dd67e4a7344c6b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a394b96bfeeee1af905935e1ed99a074, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae02e914c145ca2fc3e6b6a9129d248b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7ed22772eeb743b7cf029c97a8d7d56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcc6e1fab4c32c3b844c7fc47b033857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be099c3e29506f1968f8019945052d28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8dc53990499ac1812a2fd61b4cd82c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d44a9f90daa3fae335c81f6d50c427e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d83dabf01ce587584c1105b084083db1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e758dc85959cf7abf930600571932d9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1acc0f8c8b7989e46ea58158750ade5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f385f82dd4c9c85c9f847bf3c1d9e374, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd2b083d51c7c87db61a23bde0c90187, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fde9a06f70e93c6f3342053b9a5c1141"

Epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks, leading to massive transmissions to humans. Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans. METHODOLOGY: We explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies (IgG) specific against Sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis. Antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 49), healthy cats (n = 19), and cats with other diseases (n = 20). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis (area under the curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1; P<0.0001) versus controls. The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents. One-dimensional immunoblotting indicated that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (a 60-kDa protein in S. brasiliensis and a 70-kDa protein in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant antigen in feline sporotrichosis. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed six IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60 in the S. brasiliensis proteome, similar to the humoral response found in human sporotrichosis. CONCLUSIONS: A convergent IgG-response in various hosts (mice, cats, and humans) has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of Sporothrix and its warm-blooded hosts. We propose that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase has potential for the serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis and as target for the development of an effective multi-species vaccine against sporotrichosis in animals and humans.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f39c2660d1b95bad18c589e7a7b75e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c6df2b4420da1d64933cc98a60aaa3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3258ec48ce16a056643c79cb8d406e64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/631be4d42cd0afe44f3fbfe4043f7758, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75b7bad59603211b6a7d9ab723bcd684, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86015ec6637766e250c067312e5850ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a08d64b0b49e171069db1f8de8a09ff8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7ffe3899870abd1aa3788c6c15aa6a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbe937025fe6f8e9b783147c50604c73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d18a2c89b62735e6db0b4e2be032ae5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e337fab84dec532fcc1453e66552d74e"

Altering frameshifting efficiencies upsets this ratio, interfering with virus propagation. We have previously demonstrated that compounds that alter the kinetics of the peptidyl-transfer reaction affect programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies and interfere with viral propagation in yeast. Here, the use of a genetic approach lends further support to the hypothesis that alterations affecting the ribosome’s peptidyltransferase activity lead to changes in frameshifting efficiency and virus loss. Mutations in the RPL3 gene, which encodes a ribosomal protein located at the peptidyltransferase center, promote approximately three- to fourfold increases in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies and loss of the M(1) killer virus of yeast. The mak8-1 allele of RPL3 contains two adjacent missense mutations which are predicted to structurally alter the Mak8-1p. Furthermore, a second allele that encodes the N-terminal 100 amino acids of L3 (called L3Δ) exerts a trans-dominant effect on programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting and killer virus maintenance. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that alterations in the peptidyltransferase center affect programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting.",""

Results 45% (n=135) of the participants reported that they would be highly likely take up vaccination if it was free. When vaccination incurred a cost, however, the prevalence of uptake decreased: 36% (n=108) would take up vaccination if it cost less than $HK100, 24% (n=72) if it cost $HK101-200, and 15% (n=45) if it cost more than $HK200; and in absence of proved efficacy and safety decreased to 5% (n=14).

Methods The present prospective multi-centered, randomised double-blind trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of budesonide/formoterol (400/12µg 2 inhalations bid) versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe obstructive airway disease, not requiring initiation or intensification of systemic immunosuppressive therapy for extra thoracic graft versus host disease.

We hypothesized that an assessment of the adaptive immune system, using CD4(+) T-lymphocyte transcriptomics, would identify gene expression correlates of disease severity. METHODS: Infants infected with RSV representing extremes of clinical severity were studied. Mild illness (n = 23) was defined as a respiratory rate (RR) < 55 and room air oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) ≥ 97%, and severe illness (n = 23) was defined as RR ≥ 65 and SaO2 ≤ 92%. RNA from fresh, sort-purified CD4(+) T cells was assessed by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Gestational age, age at illness onset, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, bacterial colonization, and breastfeeding were associated (adjusted P < .05) with disease severity. RNA sequencing analysis reliably measured approximately 60% of the genome. Severity of RSV illness had the greatest effect size upon CD4 T-cell gene expression. Pathway analysis identified correlates of severity, including JAK/STAT, prolactin, and interleukin 9 signaling. We also identified genes and pathways associated with timing of symptoms and RSV group (A/B). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest fundamental changes in adaptive immune cell phenotypes may be associated with RSV clinical severity.",""

Recently, based on our model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoOLigomerization (SCHOOL) model, we suggested specific molecular mechanisms used by different viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to modulate the host immune response mediated by members of the family of multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs). This family includes T cell receptor (TCR) that is critically involved in immune diseases such as autoimmune arthritis. In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis. Using the SCHOOL approach and the SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence, we rationally designed a novel immunomodulatory peptide that targets TCR. We showed that this peptide ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice and protects against bone and cartilage damage. Incorporation of the peptide into self-assembling lipopeptide nanoparticles that mimic native human high density lipoproteins significantly increases peptide dosage efficacy. Together, our data further confirm that viral immune evasion strategies that target MIRRs can be transferred to therapeutic strategies that require similar functionalities.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29b91905666aaffa6803cd20d1ce2185, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31db69990db629f30bef4377abfc614a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4336de3d5756b0af39c8d2b42513852a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/493f440105f3f7968537bd10d321e3d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a76ac12fe893fb971b2e1a9b9d06d32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4afabcdafad821d6a084b12b56c34fbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53f09728a3e478a0f5ec447ca605b7d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b0fe6be108ee53beaf4c932380ca747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a39dd66f6952f469ab1a9089673db2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e35fe94d0253a0c759a20455a2e4d90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/734aae915bfb38b5dadf0ed57e09d63f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d1f017b7157e71efe9bdac4b52239e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81675338621ee83503dbcdc8a1282ae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b44f14b7042ab3e34cf04e99845966c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f410ead5ece95188214de69e708d6e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b08e5f5805653cf5ca4be0b404590652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9a7ef939fb78ab8a7d8b87d4e74673b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d996de71aca797f5c2d647250a83f167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfaba8e83e34feae7a9af1050ad08f37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8f6e3a8d7bed853353a1aeb19cc1186"

CoVs encode a proofreading 3′→5′exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.IMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16c53a1c4b76cddd8aa9c9276f7d44eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a62366bf74da78753dc026c8c068306, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f53f06688fe78dfb51965f7ad866fa0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/238e6bea3e8eb56f977c399e50af6747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/249bc72d778ba90f64528bbf73f01ecd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d9ca93b75306797604087872d7a6b9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f64f9b76661b8abff8ed390a248763e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37aeef1844ca57a69d67974c64cb514b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c357a908c6d29290429e6dc2e3203be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63dfdbc057300cc326e465d08f10130f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/675f393244e95fe559fcca587d95f769, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67d4d6f3da530f8693c6ab87571f8783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68295ff6f10e43ebf549ff5f802daa3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e5a237b3ce968fbacd9c68fd577709f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6eb48cc9c624d5c0acb53937aa283a67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73595698485dd7070958907d6908fa1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/758cea0e9e7dd236d8a5155a964da0fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ab83df299a0b6477571fc3726ec62e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e377c6f7498d07a008fb065f2e35c83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9317aacbe541637647242d197a103d33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/965c4d4bdc791b4d1b47d376390005c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a321e41ca775e356cae4dc4eb3898ac9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab185abc88f4254ace07ae5561fa60c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afe6cdb26916039ea706101634ca3550, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3f7d66fe401b8864a51822945d9463f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b43084b7c10b8c9bf83b89bb0bad8863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4997b6fb1db63ca0c9a84f289ecc00a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4a415df2f51dddf7ecc98f72002b69c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8856cdf35c24c389265857bd2019d17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfb4e8e6bfcc86d164bd7fa24e1611b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e44b4ca2cde1b1b85c397a3a941d66fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8cf04c4aabebf2eef38b11043531f98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb92b5831e34eb5aa003a0a055949333"

Cytokines have become valuable diagnostic tools in many medical fields. The role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytokines is of unknown value to diagnose ACR and distinguish rejection from infection. We hypothesized that distinct cytokine patterns obtained by surveillance bronchoscopies during the first year after transplantation are associated with ACR and microbiologic findings. We retrospectively analyzed data from 319 patients undergoing lung transplantation at University Hospital Zurich from 1998 to 2016. We compared levels of IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α in 747 BAL samples with transbronchial biopsies (TBB) and microbiologic results from surveillance bronchoscopies. We aimed to define reference values that would allow distinction between four specific groups “ACR”, “infection”, “combined ACR and infection” and “no pathologic process”. No definitive pattern was identified. Given the overlap between groups, these four cytokines are not suitable diagnostic markers for ACR or infection after lung transplantation.",""

Early observations that global dysregulation of −1 PRF had deleterious effects on yeast cell growth suggested that −1 PRF may be used to control cellular gene expression, and the cell cycle in particular. Collection of sufficient numbers of viral −1 PRF signals coupled with advances in computer sciences enabled 2 complementary computational approaches to identify −1 PRF signals in free living organisms. The unexpected observation that almost all −1 PRF events on eukaryotic mRNAs direct ribosomes to premature termination codons engendered the hypothesis that −1 PRF signals post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by functioning as mRNA destabilizing elements.

Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, −0.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04c930c3f8c2e8954849c86b9d3e453b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cd9882ae36608d8da86851310f7cb7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/210e91df64c876e9e944cf96f9e7d6cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35fa16269d14ca0c66c1991ad1345367, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59e8e62c21a56425cb09b2b4d601840f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690f6d5481ea8326cffb070f8130b2f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72c6e480513b9f497aae993487268c24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79953c8f3e5b5c75fe65cea992e3b6de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/822db2dff62a0755abc3d65d87482f2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86f667ecd64e9370fb1ef509c2dc0c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aac114101299624cea141c3d8ec95700, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae50a8ca6ace1968783fb91159115591, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b59b447af76ceb93c423afdc3a30a6dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9aac5d65747613c135adf6a25fea60b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba147304ba74c794c496cfd067586869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c709841333c26196f196438b9584f360, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcd7e27b8a1257d78f91a14dbc441b2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dda7189e24c5250dd8084c5951496d77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef119e1923794bf66444f51f0dc3ca7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f44b3798c8adf40f76896a1f903bb42f"

This study describes development and use of a trans-encapsidation system for the assembly of infectious RUBV-like replicon particles (VRPs) containing RUBV replicons (self replicating genomes with the SP-ORF replaced with a reporter gene). First, this system was used to map signals within the RUBV genome that mediate packaging of viral RNA. Mutations within a proposed packaging signal did not significantly affect relative packaging efficiency. The insertion of various fragments derived from the RUBV genome into Sindbis virus replicons revealed that there are several regions within the RUBV genome capable of enhancing encapsidation of heterologous replicon RNAs. Secondly, the trans-encapsidation system was used to analyse the effect of alterations within the capsid protein (CP) on release of VRPs and subsequent initiation of replication in newly infected cells. Deletion of the N-terminal eight amino acids of the CP reduced VRP titre significantly, which could be partially complemented by native CP provided in trans, indicating that this mutation affected an entry or post-entry event in the replication cycle. To test this hypothesis, the trans-encapsidation system was used to demonstrate the rescue of a lethal deletion within P150, one of the virus replicase proteins, by CP contained within the virus particle. This novel finding substantiated the functional role of CP in early post-entry replication.",""

Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-of-a-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machine-learning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public expression data sets, reformulated to create a test bed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading methods, and show that CSAX aids in both identifying anomalies and explaining their underlying biology. We describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks. We then illustrate CSAX's value in two developmental case studies. Confirming prior hypotheses, CSAX highlights disruption of platelet activation pathways in a neonate with retinopathy of prematurity and identifies, for the first time, dysregulated oxidative stress response in second trimester amniotic fluid of fetuses with obese mothers.

Much more conflicting reports are published about normal sinus flora, the role of anaerobes and the microbiology of chronic sinusitis. The relationship between infectious and allergic diseases ise more difficult to explain. It is shown that, in particular viruses can induce the release of inflammatory mediators and modify the inflammatory process. Their role in epithelial damage, excitation of nerve fibers, sensitization of inflammatory cells, and therefore, in general hyperreactivity has also been reported.

To establish a productive infection in new host species, viruses must overcome barriers to replication mediated by diverse and rapidly evolving host restriction factors such as protein kinase R (PKR). Many viral antagonists of these restriction factors are species specific. For example, the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist, RhTRS1, inhibits PKR in some African green monkey (AGM) cells, but does not inhibit human or rhesus macaque PKR. To model the evolutionary changes necessary for cross-species transmission, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses RhTRS1 in a strain that lacks PKR inhibitors E3L and K3L (VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1). Serially passaging VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 in minimally-permissive AGM cells increased viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Notably, adaptation in these AGM cells also improved virus replication 1000- to 10,000-fold in human and rhesus cells. Genetic analyses including deep sequencing revealed amplification of the rhtrs1 locus in the adapted viruses. Supplying additional rhtrs1 in trans confirmed that amplification alone was sufficient to improve VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 replication. Viruses with amplified rhtrs1 completely blocked AGM PKR, but only partially blocked human PKR, consistent with the replication properties of these viruses in AGM and human cells. Finally, in contrast to AGM-adapted viruses, which could be serially propagated in human cells, VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 yielded no progeny virus after only three passages in human cells. Thus, rhtrs1 amplification in a minimally permissive intermediate host was a necessary step, enabling expansion of the virus range to previously nonpermissive hosts. These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00db7648149585bb22cce05907a71bb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01a4cfe79517847301154fcc720b87d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02aeee282b7a8cb31ee9a8a35815b813, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/039937100d4c0349b7d81227173dd3ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07589bffc50192b45c5264081acbecfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17ad98cc333a017d225d3505f840ed2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e86d5b6ac610a39a0203410f35ff538, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/202e6218cba15410d5cc5c14ea62c467, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296bb9f5604c31207ce8874ac5b24321, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3faa20bccdfc00af423e5315cbc2a327, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/462282f486dce2a02640c6e622321d83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49538a0f0a8cd4bfb9bd3b368f0cc930, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62a61bbf9e89a2175308727b2afb614e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66d432b1164bee55f735000f5e503b02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70d0c10ba327e100b8687f78223493b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89abda6f04dc1ccf8b68c640aab44b20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8caebab489e437fa440fde7a5e2e5cc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cf2564773f4b1db1116bfb14b6e7ac7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90895bcef56be0541fa77afe1b307690, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94d7f63e6f350c1207146bc3a531918d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95a37ea927c522049559c6af82f69849, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98d369dfb12f19f341cb2f9f4647251a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99b01baa2c52145668b95e19e779e865, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a36ea9cabfbbb98a81ee77517d57401f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6f6fc33f056260780218979de8d3fe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8b9c90d28a128a53470d9d195904360, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acadde6e3a0bab661cc5c3b5f6af5e5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aec79d96c9092f1a78e9abd57b35d845, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0569039b9702704e232a746e0192e94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4a0f5e6dc333f1877284d07cc1e3154, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b83a27d3ede054e3dab8818a66cbd7ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb8a611e6d8ebcc742a0e0c8423ca643, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbb21b5d7a2a0753ff0ca07cfe78187a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c39a1cb676a44b8bb4695f58e407e5b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb43cc7989e60b4eca6e8c10c8e0a22c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf9be68cb6d68405f09caf022626ac5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec38f0072ff1eeddb8b22af1185713a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed9b0a8883dc65c7145ff58398d70b31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f70426e575ebb1d06fb88bca7aba7275, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7c7cebd22980ad04ff4be9ad1921f36"

Patients with ALI/ARDS have alveolar epithelial injury, which may be worsened by high-pressure mechanical ventilation. Alveolar type II (ATII) cells are the progenitor cells for the alveolar epithelium and are required to reestablish the alveolar epithelium during the recovery process from ALI/ARDS. Lung fibroblasts (FBs) migrate and proliferate early after lung injury and likely are an important source of growth factors for epithelial repair. However, how lung FBs affect epithelial wound healing in the human adult lung has not been investigated in detail. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is known to be released mainly from FBs and to stimulate both migration and proliferation of primary rat ATII cells. HGF is also increased in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and serum in patients with ALI/ARDS. Therefore, we hypothesized that HGF secreted by FBs would enhance wound closure in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Wound closure was measured using a scratch wound-healing assay in primary human AEC monolayers and in a coculture system with FBs. We found that wound closure was accelerated by FBs mainly through HGF/c-Met signaling. HGF also restored impaired wound healing in AECs from the elderly subjects and after exposure to cyclic stretch. We conclude that HGF is the critical factor released from FBs to close wounds in human AEC monolayers and suggest that HGF is a potential strategy for hastening alveolar repair in patients with ALI/ARDS.",""

Two systems were used to analyze the effect of different antibodies on PrP(Sc) formation: (i) neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with the 22L mouse-adapted scrapie stain, and (ii) protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), which uses PrP(Sc) as a template or seed, and a series of incubations and sonications, to convert PrP(C) to PrP(Sc). The two systems yielded similar results, in most cases, and demonstrate that PrP-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) vary in their ability to inhibit the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) conversion process. Based on the numerous and varied Mabs analyzed, the inhibitory effect does not appear to be epitope specific, related to PrP(C) conformation, or to cell membrane localization, but is influenced by the targeted PrP region (amino vs carboxy).","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e4abada553fffe081f8fcf48b8e6838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1535506a8c9ef55532fa3013e61f8f82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d06f574d39e6e7f1be1f1f371adf8a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23061320ba4335b6b493327b2b69ef41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3886c9efcc9b9296a3b11dc1177dc908, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4635baf87ea3feb9ae14dbd20a91f0b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49767669efd78c7a6899a015fb931fb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e4c53fba9f14cc40864e5ccb58c00a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/755fc7af10a19f5a17a37518867963b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77c8d5f78ee7ea60128aef407b13b57f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/787c97b038fc63d8b0347ea40e61c8b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b5cdabf64f9762d38258edc376b4f7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bf5b945cff8a4129c17fbfbace168f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cea9de2e6bd6b6bd544849775bff548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dec1732871c020054e76e845939b3d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e598fe5ef9c544de9a109fafbd5968a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a93cf78c1f257034ba21c9dd0faa7d23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7f1be3cdfaae05eb529c9cb273d43ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9cce3ededc0956bccece39beb324612, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caac1ed6439d8674774d9a13f6707a8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd27d5cfdd5574724ebcc2a8579a5891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2820a593ef431504b818835550cd9b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d85ebfd05a3519a028d22820896d2cc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f10b010b01fb6423034ad012108c68a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faef55a1aeb22e978a18094781a18784, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc7f8d97d207245e1221097e9f6a84ac"

Furthermore, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles: as all other cellular endomembranes, they are continuously moving along cytoskeleton, and, most importantly, they constantly interact one with each other by membrane tethering, fusion and fission. This review aims to highlight the tight correlation between the morphodynamics of mitochondria and their biological function(s), in physiological as well as stress conditions, in particular nutrient deprivation, pathogen attack and some human diseases. Finally, we emphasize some crosstalk between the fusion/fission machinery and the autophagy pathway to ending on some speculative hypothesis to inspire future research in the field.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0553efabc530020a9fabcf346cb74926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/098db720cc5498f20dbe7b3459a3bea7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e6e7a236c1d6c2d017c446fd1fd06f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f9947f89915c50d285a332f92350c4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/132a5fc2d293a61452bb203c868f287e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14137150b0642a73145562aa8e697dac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21184f6e817c3392a450def79e5b75d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2143da5735360b21fc5d3f141da869d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33ec2c22e94e2cbd0b17e1823675fd3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3951c86df4645120e4933374527c3ca5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d93c78256429f8adf84bcef815c9835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40bce9942652096bf3fb6c0c1c12a968, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53302b23c11d4cb120b3d20848768705, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53591168df30f34d5ad9c8322cc16f87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/671845b6eac56a4794870a8e43082478, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e00919e14879d085f1eb598287c6f87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72766b18d65fbf00bc0ce2689eb3954d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b5b78396d212f91e83fdd7fa167d73a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cd5878c1a858c065e8b0c81824510e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88b2e6f3010c35dc1beb76e9ea9231dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c65084c4e546e1ef6d6ad10fb0552f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91a056f761e82c86d2d79974553f314c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a516481764868ddddf696cd0ff10b9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b983dbedb809b912ab6b651ab68ca9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6c0821c94daab23b8bef4aeb7156f7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a73e60f9b9ebe67902e6cfd643750b9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae43e3bf1bcdfcca9fedd209ab2f0e06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b434b0fa98f59bf984d786a8c5e1ea6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c84e5df4bdf6b71d5c7a7f23fe3dbf32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfcf9a9993e8e058c8e0363c74cdc4e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0dad8027715dc88d5df5dbd0b9e9b32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2ca109206d7cef0ab052c7bfc5e3194, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e445f12d6b374754f8f7824a622357f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e808e0c77de2a17377af08af36053a00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa6ad4738fe4901166809268732a44bd"

Both clinical trials and animal models of type I and type II diabetes have shown that hyperactivity of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications. Of clinical relevance, blockade of the renin–angiotensin system prevents new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of diabetic complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently discovered mono-carboxypeptidase and the first homolog of ACE. It is thought to inhibit Ang-II signaling cascades mostly by cleaving Ang-II to generate Ang-(1–7), which effects oppose Ang-II and are mediated by the Mas receptor. The enzyme is present in the kidney, liver, adipose tissue and pancreas. Its expression is elevated in the endocrine pancreas in diabetes and in the early phase during diabetic nephropathy. ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, we have shown the presence of the Mas receptor in the mouse pancreas and observed a reduction in Mas receptor immuno-reactivity as well as higher fasting blood glucose levels in ACE2 knockout mice, indicating that these mice may be a new model to study the role of ACE2 in diabetes. In this review we will examine the role of the renin–angiotensin system in the physiopathology and treatment of diabetes and highlight the potential benefits of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis, focusing on recent data about ACE2.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0275903c1be30e1c1acc2049b95bb7de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a23f63a3972920a7c76b37ade439ce0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b01dcdb4e553c43493e1f2fb41306d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f810dd45a090087a16f6469af4f5cf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33f3e975c790bc5f8a17778bbc39e55b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38a3ea715eade2f494be5c184f19aa53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a18e3280ce35176cdb61bd2b9dba32c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a23682a16d8ca6d64e556c815412184, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4079a38f57a469b76d638594d3120a6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4125f0192ca73dd84ad5fa61354efd40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b367816f0723eb57e79b89a0698eeb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f7eb0089f894a0c231f0703c1c268b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5356547da5174ffe9de1925c099a70a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53e0fe83105521305fd1c133115a6330, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55f649730c268accb853410db28e731e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d19c3a738ef89dcee05c63522d18d55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60022f7f0ece57ffa4e6c56402808877, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60dc835c2c66a91d6ad7d2bc5aa96f5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bb4b3c94440e4d608966fda027b0aab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d5f47f73498b324f1a7431545624ac2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70f5cd38c6fd56de6d4a3ba76dab1eca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/751c35cfaa3e8c33f61d84e55e428c5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80c1e1045ab9cb7b6196b46d38982b5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/833a4dcddc54ae155b55b843141a563c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/885717e21740575b5047957ba64767dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f95a21f8e70a399c7fb6324d28f0b56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a45132e57f7d4220a58b81c9d03086b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a09706286f73045cb36be5f926f0482c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b20fa649562635cb10d324425c5ce87b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3c01083dc1623a392f52f19ad53be40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba28dd0faadca2755ef9ce30f37fb7d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfaca9e958d0f00c84e6e08986ed59d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c32c1f820261f4ace2a16730deb29304, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cac81387ba5c218ec0ca1c6a68eeb80e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caffaf1dce9eb0bcdb18d9331516d061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9106fc2116b99c71bd0a030e902893a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da01fd2f3f1c84db2a776625efd71a18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd0942cfd6989c20b2f62dcfae5ddce8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0a234d987f08a0f821c1a57bef32234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e904158995e6f0077afb809cf1ce955e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f236193c723ce2b855a58b42454181e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f25689c361bf02b82fd1243cb8887baf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f40888bbc1499c694100a91e42a2c668, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4aeb87e8348aabf860fda6e42f7e9e7"

In this study, we analyzed the feasibility of a crucial viral replication factor, namely, importin-α7, as a cellular drug target to combat pandemic influenza viruses. Surprisingly, only five viral lung-to-lung passages were required to achieve 100% lethality in importin-α7(−/−) mice that otherwise are resistant. Viral escape from importin-α7 requirement was mediated by five mutations in the viral ribonucleoprotein complex and the surface glycoproteins. Moreover, the importin-α7(−/−) mouse-adapted strain became even more virulent for wild-type mice than the parental strain. These studies show that targeting host proteins may still result in viral escape by alternative pathways, eventually giving rise to even more virulent virus strains. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach to reduce viral drug resistance. IMPORTANCE Here, we investigated the long-standing hypothesis based on in vitro studies that viral drug resistance occurrence is less likely if compounds are directed against cellular rather than viral proteins. Here, we challenged this hypothesis by analyzing, in an in vivo animal model, the feasibility of targeting the cellular factor importin-α7, which is crucial for human influenza virus replication and pathogenesis, as an efficient antiviral strategy against pandemic influenza viruses. In summary, our studies suggest that resistance against cellular factors is possible in vivo, and the emergence of even more virulent viral escape variants calls for particular caution. Thus, therapeutic intervention strategies should consider a multitarget approach using compounds against viral as well as cellular factors to reduce the risk of viral drug resistance and potentially increased virulence.",""

Surface expression of CD11a and CD49d has been shown to identify antigen-specific CD4 T cells against viral pathogens in mice. We hypothesized that CD11a and CD49d would also serve as markers of human antigen-specific T cells responding to vaccination. METHODS: A phase I vaccine trial enabled us to evaluate a novel gating strategy based on surface expression of CD11a and CD49d as a means of detecting antigen-specific, cytokine producing CD4 and CD8 T cells induced after vaccination of naïve individuals against leishmaniasis. Three study groups received LEISH-F3 recombinant protein combined with either squalene oil-in-water emulsion (SE) alone, SE with the synthetic TLR-4 ligand glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA-SE), or SE with Salmonella minnesota-derived monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL-SE). Individuals were given 3 vaccine doses, on days 0, 28 and 168. RESULTS: Starting after the first vaccine dose, the frequency of both CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) CD4 and CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) CD8 T cells significantly increased over time throughout the 24-week trial. To confirm the role of CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) expression in the identification of the antigen-specific T cells, cytokine production was measured following LEISH-F3 stimulation. All of the IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 producing cells were found within the CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the change in the frequency of CD11a(hi)CD49d(+) T cells can be used to track antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses following T cell-targeted vaccination.",""

Pathological and neuroimaging studies have confirmed that brain atrophy in alcoholics is mainly due to widespread white matter (WM) loss with neuronal loss restricted to specific regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that NNK causes WM degeneration, an effect that is exacerbated by alcohol, but unlike alcohol, it has little impact on the neuronal components of the brain.",""

Here, we report that the airway abundance of Streptococcus was higher in samples collected at the time of RSV infection compared with samples collected one month later. RSV infection is associated with neutrophil influx into the airway and degranulation and is marked by overexpression of proteins with known antibacterial activity including BPI, EPX, MPO and AZU1.

Conducting research without any working hypotheses may produce serendipitous discoveries, but the chances of success are much slimmer than any information-based targeted approach. Therefore, the plant selection process is extremely important for ensuring success. In recent years, there have been significant amounts of work involving applications of various mathematical modelling and computational techniques to predict medicinal properties of plants, and thus to provide information-based selection of plant materials for further studies aiming at potential drug discovery and development. This chapter presents an overview of methods and processes involved in plant selection by utilizing various mathematical modelling and computational techniques.",""

The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; encoded by ABCG2) regulates the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts and protects the fetus from maternally derived xenobiotics. Information about BCRP function in EVTs is limited, however placental exposure to bacterial/viral infection leads to BCRP downregulation in syncitiotrophoblasts. We hypothesized that BCRP is involved in the regulation of EVT function and is modulated by infection/inflammation. We report that besides syncitiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, BCRP is also expressed in EVTs. BCRP inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (human EVT-like) cells and in human EVT explant cultures, while not affecting cell proliferation. We have also shown that bacterial—lipopolysaccharide (LPS)—and viral antigens—single stranded RNA (ssRNA)—have a profound effect in downregulating ABCG2 and BCRP levels, whilst simultaneously increasing the migration potential of EVT-like cells. Our study reports a novel function of BCRP in early placentation and suggests that exposure of EVTs to maternal infection/inflammation could disrupt their migration potential via the downregulation of BCRP. This could negatively influence placental development/function, contribute to existing obstetric pathologies, and negatively impact pregnancy outcomes and maternal/neonatal health.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/006057d8c568a2af957dda6063deb977, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/031cb35208b9e3b84f69e3088ef1c4e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07a8a24e1c459277ffc381fe6b5eabc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/119c0b98031f2653655d33c99d06feac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11b8eb3e835121620c192319bddb1cc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1229c35cd110774147a4868ba8817bce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13cafa6c1debbd7c1916c0934abdb59d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1daf4f118075160a8b2d2f1dd6bbd109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3074c56666eebc1bb4094d7365736381, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d9ae4b2a1ef91471878e7aab3e4d0c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43045da569188e836f12afc2eeba8968, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48e039480bf4b1cd4e96075bc26d12b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5240872ec14843950e0611d7a8ca188c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53a15dc345d23752ef519819f89084fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55ff3212fe6cd29f02c8c9631d3b12bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/582ecf8ce6bdeecbbb6db60feea1a969, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59245ad381b9180a84c20eb459319a1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fb4536438a375e53aaac9751354551d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62a98fa90875330b057bc748c894a42e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64a1668206137ff625bc75312f32d803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a86334a9e342f9078e0c2e3782f2bda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74c651347ff78d71b16b91438ea2ff7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77a5ee15f703ba68bfd1f2c288e1d555, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78eeb4857d688478b1547bbca0b4e5e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a0256dd9a87299993a6c2acb601f7a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7df2f375dde8713c9ecc1b091537680e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/828e893fd6b573e422ece03ef8cd6162, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/870db83a43cf688a27ea656aaeefaece, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e0c8e520e60611a5d9c916a16a4f7c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fffa0e3c02a0b1879e1b8322fbd66d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93ca357f038aa2fb676bd57766167fce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7de68b3008fdab57b314b279d42e280, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c92a0758941103bbfb52b17249c9f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be2ec78f3491f08005b7fbf179576e64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c19b98f58c5aa3d9fa3fd591773e8327, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c44e16dc62ab6207df9a87a7e0b724bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7ed920ddd24237166a48ab2118da03c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9799241a283f728fdd6f3c8cff391a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db7119d3668656061278c57ef7b12fa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7e6286611a7ea6c182b9e396ea34230, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e802625161cee3baa2cd42400b7ac8b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2ef016eb08348649b0036c395eafc03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff4814362c3a67055c1706df54472a86"

This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most, but not all parts of the tree of mammalian CoVs. We next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co-segregation of CoVs and bat hosts encompassing the Betacoronavirus clades b and d, with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals, then present examples of CoVs infecting different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other. We also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat CoVs, and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hotspots in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We then present evidence for a zoonotic origin of four of the six known human CoVs (HCoV), three of which likely involved bats, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E; compare the available data on CoV pathogenesis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts; and discuss hypotheses on the putative insect origins of CoV ancestors. Finally, we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoonotic potential of bat viruses, based only on genomic sequence data, and emphasize the need to preserve these ecologically highly relevant animals. This paper forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on “from SARS to MERS: 10years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses”.",""

Preventing the entry of EBOV into host cells is an attractive antiviral strategy, which has been validated for HIV by the FDA approval of the anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide. To identify inhibitors of EBOV entry, the EBOV envelope glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) gene was used to generate pseudotype viruses for screening of chemical libraries. A benzodiazepine derivative (compound 7) was identified from a high-throughput screen (HTS) of small-molecule compound libraries utilizing the pseudotype virus. Compound 7 was validated as an inhibitor of infectious EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) in cell-based assays, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 10 μM and 12 μM, respectively. Time-of-addition and binding studies suggested that compound 7 binds to EBOV-GP at an early stage during EBOV infection. Preliminary Schrödinger SiteMap calculations, using a published EBOV-GP crystal structure in its prefusion conformation, suggested a hydrophobic pocket at or near the GP1 and GP2 interface as a suitable site for compound 7 binding. This prediction was supported by mutational analysis implying that residues Asn69, Leu70, Leu184, Ile185, Leu186, Lys190, and Lys191 are critical for the binding of compound 7 and its analogs with EBOV-GP. We hypothesize that compound 7 binds to this hydrophobic pocket and as a consequence inhibits EBOV infection of cells, but the details of the mechanism remain to be determined. In summary, we have identified a novel series of benzodiazepine compounds that are suitable for optimization as potential inhibitors of filoviral infection.",""

To achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences (RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89K PAI present in the genome of SS2 strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to STSS, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003e5fb67d62d980383cf3c0bd8a839a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/009afccf494e9433ed5fe4dc24746e0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/024b6a9596b9e523f7505b60ee5fd56f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17c6ddb99d9f357ceaa8876ceda6dca5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0d51ddcf2479797c4c7a1966f27cd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/265dd94f9f2108bf62a230a04e453dda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d5e12a1d8d9101571fa555e926afb11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32d9ac7157431604d06e6862575e51c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36116def04445df566e0e34e897d5ae5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a0e8158e29c48ce62efcc9115fa8f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/502eab8a547bf975ab115b70f55d620e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/547dc4d9f2a1c46a64a5df88b0c003f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dc6e51ee46fa8681548f878ae9820a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68c035aa0e28d08ff4463ad0082efcc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cc7dce67171b4f6e4f9b1b25f8823dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d018ace8ab528fa04dfd76a7ed1f5b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81ab7671b212adaeb5dddc6db3f1697d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85a1549c8923e6d11b737723bd2bd7e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b20ff079fba179f008a95ef2ae43e4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/933fcae766c267f8801aee8ff522eb5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/981d234b555b70731f1a222dbb7be134, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9860e650e69f1a861f94295d8b921d31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f04d37d09af858bef046147d9bd67bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad162fae94bfaff1d6fdff1d2d2fb00f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b357a397d57ffd80569aeaf028329993, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5e8854257ccc03cc6e85a94002ba4e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1677f4c426f73573288de84b258befc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d44f9bfb21923ffc7808555495709708, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3746a722fe28087f6cc317955fceba6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6dc05d184e6efa4c2813e631070aa83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec905537e89d0326c8b06509a185f23d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd66db6a32697735c82cd12b2331e279, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe64f0e65555ece6986180de8761a6df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe655099ea892b597b1cd4b6fe916d4b"

The expression of B0AT1 in kidney was recently shown to depend on its association with collectrin (Tmem27), a protein homologous to the membrane-anchoring domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. Methods Because collectrin is almost absent from small intestine, we tested the hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B0AT1 in enterocytes. Furthermore, because B0AT1 expression depends on an associated protein, we tested the hypothesis that Hartnup-causing B0AT1 mutations differentially impact on B0AT1 interaction with intestinal and kidney accessory proteins. Results Immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and functional experiments using wild-type and ace2-null mice showed that expression of B0AT1 in small intestine critically depends on ACE2. Coexpressing new and previously identified Hartnup disorder–causing missense mutations of B0AT1 with either collectrin or ACE2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the high-frequency D173N and the newly identified P265L mutant B0AT1 transporters can still be activated by ACE2 but not collectrin coexpression. In contrast, the human A69T and R240Q B0AT1 mutants cannot be activated by either of the associated proteins, although they function as wild-type B0AT1 when expressed alone. Conclusions We thus show that ACE2 is necessary for the expression of the Hartnup transporter in intestine and suggest that the differential functional association of mutant B0AT1 transporters with ACE2 and collectrin in intestine and kidney, respectively, participates in the phenotypic heterogeneity of human Hartnup disorder.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0558d6ea03634cc1af219bd7c71d683d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13593fcfc03d584fa8c68c2a8bdaf446, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18223ad1b890de1d18249c8bc8c7c3e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18332cfc26cb150a3b4dc61f2099df56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aac52f7fa57c449aa70b634f28a7b22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/210be73b1845b7ef987249a0436981c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/222cb89377a4695bfbd5fb26d2315e91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d5517610557696f842ace234c9251cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/348c882edbd715f99e87d33dadc4db21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3507f2877846c4246cbd237f8734994f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fe700aff032ed876f04d22ba2196cf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5be3d29f84c785374190eb6f2d791f5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69dcaf93ee94b84883be87c61c0c82b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/722b12d1a2540a30e04a8c14b306653b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/723086c269ca9b1f8a5cb45950dc98f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73c7a4bc842788a567aed9a075c747c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a9a609a69213928983f7a1bb37b512, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a8b41c3520726d012facd40e8390880, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e40221913ad0c98ac0d3dce55a99475, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89b3fed15f0b3dd62b781a5524fc28e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ade1dd64fa1ec7de3e2ee125bb7fb03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f2932a3e4d280d53b278dd5666949fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94715c4db5aa9beffde07f8734a2e5d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/972fae9c1ae6e9f0c76451632aba6fb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aed92a75936b3845955dd51f9d01a16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e80f3fc56fc6efb97e115902d231ad7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f439ed22bcfd14243c004c737058d6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab0a0cf11bacc45a76c0eabac9919f15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b95300a39d14629a1172dcf36468937a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba7219af49d4ff40d9db2c131b8b1226, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc703b77ea914800b9a4c907eb774f59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdce1c741aa5a4140a91b21a6b26d759, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3c2d8a08eba6a1ad03a282bc8a3da48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbf06a3e563c33c7120942bada05da9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cca60ba5be7fab94837f3fcdd890f241, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce5a9c1be9f161bf09938260f30fd0b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dff4bbaf261965e4b62225710a8187a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e357a409948e50188fb1f34f413c714d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0ee174da85e9988bbf4a757b0e1c6a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffa680c66e578b15c1dd4ad5f3607288, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffe1fc9b28854a91b3d858ca056a2f94"

Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/089d3d42b52cf118024b8aae768e142a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c10fd1262614bd4870ce2edc7579919, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c234c44276bda09d16679d38f9bb76b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fd06f832ae3a41f09c48e1884543c34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ae7000654a4f6622863996d86d2fd0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b84c4309b4db8ef1e907e3458fe1215, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/277ca22a61ffe32c4bf0dc94b0dec78d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cacbe03281a09248056f907ff26be0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42b617db818b94490bb03c6b34f8baa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43a104c3003072439aafa77b96b9227e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45c6eac880b7332b5308356b9e4b192e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d5ddff9f7f058a7e641da829d6f56bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fbbf7d79a59a361ce6fc41e607649bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cd2e755db1e38f0aa260d79c0506ef6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d00a1624ac42364156dce702b78b76f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/707656919b37d78ab032cb1c868e949d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76974f43053972791554d5fe5309d6e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e3e417e5c5a8b1bd1f8886c3196afa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80c4115299c9a5c45c94e6c5e5cd3774, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/848e0c8cbe8aa08872f4716f804beeb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84948c9c985e81508a2fd30bfd1b9dcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/885a82832cd688abe265cdd20c6b9c20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919624a66dc290bb1c84a066940f2acd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96afc2ef2bbbac32c1820f183867e0a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97bae8876efe67393a47b89b9c996534, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9affe91177b2ca54f2b2d5a9dd811072, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a124a80ed0c6716bac331bd90b37fe1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a59fa0150f0849a754bbb5c3c4492b44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab003cba9f517ae843e084341bef30fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad2b1659be682c6678592b1036370808, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6ff1a379b741572361735557428a826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c274f093b10449f5ac07875ff79234fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c932cb169e9a7b89e208a9d309f59f80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c97e5160e9008cf86b3f11e39a4218f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf1223c8072c750f7eac5c15d8afe485, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3d3017755c0f1ab9162f1dbf6a5c426, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d57b8f07e239b1471fdc9ee0327b6a9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbd593991d2ea9c7557c63cbcdbb8748, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc1d419e73bbc92a309f080336dca0e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4429a0bf00ebe3f94ca95655750680b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec73d20d38c21a424e9eec3af72281c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee436fcfe030f3b581cad2fbcc75abd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f22aecb0766cf913d54a079241faffe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f41c70843e48cd58b2e6d2fc3f944574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f672a44f9264be3e2ff5d07777b3b048, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fed06cabcea34ba8695f2f66adab0c26"

Despite progress in many areas, we still do not have an integrated understanding of the initiating factors, the key steps in the progression of ALI, and the central processes involved in repair.

We assessed the effectiveness of ribavirin and corticosteroids as the initial treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome using propensity score analysis. Methods We analyzed data on 1755 patients in Hong Kong and 191 patients in Toronto with severe acute respiratory syndrome using a generalized propensity score approach. Results The adjusted excess case fatality ratios of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome receiving the combined therapy of ribavirin and corticosteroids within 2 days of admission, compared with those receiving neither treatment within 2 days of admission, were 3.8% (95% confidence interval, −1.5 to 9.2) in Hong Kong and 2.1% (95% confidence interval, −44.3 to 48.5) in Toronto. Conclusions Our results add strength to the hypothesis that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids has no therapeutic benefit when given early during severe acute respiratory syndrome infection.

In rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), adverse cardiac remodelling occurs despite elevated cardiac ACE2 activity. We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1–7 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1–7 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels. As in vitro studies showed no direct effect of DIZE on ACE2 or ACE activity, the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains to be determined.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00b31da11eb5c1df3c3b11b8be0e371b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05f3ddc16ca834dc5607cfb301d2c9ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/065610a1a62f40683531d90ce5802bac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08b76c77c2b0032b593d4f1ea8dbf0cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/287be10eed2906571fc9971b4e8feca7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29a737c126afa1dc0959b02e48dad0d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2edddb05c0a2591da798f776c18cee4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fe557e9777467cba0534e74a27b2c01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3070dfa9bfa6a6ac63dc2fbb9da804ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37376ed36c7685ad0f1ba66060d439c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4551bb81b1e0b1e2364aa86cb13e4a1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fbdfdbb066901566864062959b9bafe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a36ac9220322b7a4da50dac2ea0c499, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5be5510d585d67d0f49ce1f3eeda0ca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ede47528f4533f6686e2e53dd17caeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/699bd05f3e4589c766a0592976a1705a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7154009e204a35a57c7e272f4504bc8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76e76d062259fd040e8c7a21c01f15cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/787623d7c834eaabfad35781f9d777b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f3c947f6e8d0313b65e887159f9c758, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/878a52e240603b4d7841e48cccc93cb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/895ff58dac18c0157b54fb0666be7987, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/986fac4dd119ab1742976a56c79eeec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a7443b4bc0f457adf4c4c2abb57c6a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e3e6f17494bc43e1f471a8ebc8e0a29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a20460bfa729f9199d4c6b185aaf8c4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cded10030316ff759045ec9717c8a736, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce8bd04e275c1203d04e80ace07ba6a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9e41770ad2f37c22cbf7f96a31a262b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb9cf71b6db4698b4a3edcd38c42739, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7325d1c48842fe162b67e9060bdba59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e982bfc8f658bfa4bee1d736273027d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee99ecccda7994a49e746ddcb3760d43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef8d5ffe5adf9a366c61dff023784e6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a1953e2d503e83ed764a904734d0bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8306695a327878b8a0bb323088ec5af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff433d5a9698c0f562f45c4088c2e817"

The receptor-binding subunit of GP must be cleaved (by endosomal cathepsins) in order for entry and infection to proceed. Cleavage appears to proceed through 50-kDa and 20-kDa intermediates, ultimately generating a key 19-kDa core. How 19-kDa GP is subsequently triggered to bind membranes and induce fusion remains a mystery. Here we show that 50-kDa GP cannot be triggered to bind to liposomes in response to elevated temperature but that 20-kDa and 19-kDa GP can. Importantly, 19-kDa GP can be triggered at temperatures ∼10°C lower than 20-kDa GP, suggesting that it is the most fusion ready form. Triggering by heat (or urea) occurs only at pH 5, not pH 7.5, and involves the fusion loop, as a fusion loop mutant is defective in liposome binding. We further show that mild reduction (preferentially at low pH) triggers 19-kDa GP to bind to liposomes, with the wild-type protein being triggered to a greater extent than the fusion loop mutant. Moreover, mild reduction inactivates pseudovirion infection, suggesting that reduction can also trigger 19-kDa GP on virus particles. Our results support the hypothesis that priming of EBOV GP, specifically to the 19-kDa core, potentiates GP to undergo subsequent fusion-relevant conformational changes. Our findings also indicate that low pH and an additional endosomal factor (possibly reduction or possibly a process mimicked by reduction) act as fusion triggers.",""

Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1α protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1α expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8±7.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5±3.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2±2.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6±2.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α expression in the treatment of ONFH.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01e62b635a7e111651b36c0538c103b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bbf68e70579ae462ae083f709e09ac9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10542e401d110cc687ff4b56f6f0753a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1386781dd6c6b52a6ca377ffbdd3482c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d4b818749fb070f6ec83cf9bcc978c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c75bf5e29a143c513c8e67415d5820b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/393aae5f9d8a3b15cd162f80af648f46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44cff7b1e2f090848bd669c3a24bd260, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59be45c8b15fb6f379f23ba059157dc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65db8e9802664fe5aa83f611a4f13740, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a21b797596a4a1dba0db133ef9288c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c128374daa68dddb77ad336840a2da8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d660efd4df6865e2698193241bac6e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/823be20317bd8dcf441dec3afd1cdae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85e53057708136b98204d1f8b655d530, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8996f83198e5849c08935de86face8d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8de717c215499f3a7b064d014711cb79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96b5f2c4e300ada3819188b6d8396f79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f229226591090f49b0e9a34bdaed4ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abbdf182daa540e5a8aac133f2d83926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd88a0b020c00e7300817425bdd5ff3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c23c5549c2b169a03212b04f3e26cbd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c44548028b76a01c8ee5c1ca5ca20ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c759bd0665b23eed42c6479cb93f7487, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca51b8e8371b1d39019503b7c4eb614d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca69b26544651c4d5f4df05e3ddf412f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf724c86c57c30f46e499718ad2dc7a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0b61d31bdafee8589d43dea65964aea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d39136630ab3be633a6f3902c51c5978, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4ddb372aa22f04737d70dbd0d5a6a32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e46977f57da009d12bf83901a7b4e180, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee963e782562c86c36e363e1fa7de365"

In this study, we sought to use this signal transduction conduit against them by inhibiting multiple kinases that influence translation. Previous work indicated that several kinases involved in translation, including p70 S6K, p90RSK, ERK, and p38 MAPK, are phosphorylated following Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. Furthermore, inhibiting p70 S6K through treatment with the FDA approved drug rapamycin prevents RVFV pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSK’s upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication. Treatment with the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins and reduced RVFV titers. In contrast, treatment with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 alone had minimal influence on RVFV titers. The combination of PF-4708671 and BI-D1870 treatment resulted in robust inhibition of RVFV replication. Likewise, a synergistic inhibition of RVFV replication was observed with p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 combined with rapamycin treatment. These findings serve as a proof of concept regarding combination kinase inhibitor treatment for RVFV infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/000d58ccb1f7e346667697ff1080ceb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a676df181fa6ee80b08d3af4ff3041e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b29a84da547fbda30cb5053c8133196, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/142932f904522eea16b9d470eb8f1783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1564ea71400646bebc1cdb4f8996ce68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/179e949411e79eeb5217485eb234b799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/192ad2eae1c58f30f58ed7144878b0e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ff145b8f962aee23c3f354cd5ba07d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30277c0ae0832122025946bd0fe0dc94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d3b6c8ea4cb0defc99a6bf07c77b8b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ec7c025e586f5978226dd21d3553469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50a4e7ae177a19729c7677c33b1839df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/647b266eb06349be0c37b76585f0937a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/665dfb018f68f65d963bf4102d2a7f7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7109729da4f52f35a7716879c50a8b0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73f0e9831be86edee488094e6f1ee0c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74124f1a771589d1c39b248e6ee9a515, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/743cba696f02f916e8fe300e4063b03a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76dadee4b87014145d6b648bdc0753a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77084d4afd087851b656c4ae6624ef60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c923d87a3fabee506a5b7bc4bd2b8b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80282f219f85893ed2ed177fa25efb78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84a2fe939092a2599140434213d43da3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89de5851f6c81e409410ada48a540ef5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91889b3485f4cebbf3a507d0d8b68033, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a07a8a8d97ad04a5fb13ae56f590b828, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a16fcc07690559c289ea8f415c9c4515, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a34ca9b34e583dc6f68e375bcb44e5f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5fc6353ca325141f1fd954b2995aa74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8804484cdf8c2bb8f25a4f0819ab5ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac0ea0aec3dde8661127cf8e253209ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acf96c21e231107face26038135d7e95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b74c6f2f2cc2f09e2ff22d7fba428302, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c49041d729369db0142cce1b4ae9bebf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7764695331c79121c17b4411c326697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c90e1233968176da79c429fc0276b464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdd33075b0b8ee2b6fc2390bf6903fe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cea5eed12733171ea01dfa2d17684252, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db1ad05cd17ca7f84d8c2cdff383a123, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db61116783e81542c6ef223b999da93f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9967114825c052a990e2f6225c041d6"

To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12, and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44, and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively modest neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44, and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12, and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00f58905bd3ceb6208d834f82f1670c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0884eb4be030683600f10c321a852ed7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10260371eadc2745758587cac828b944, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11aa470724a55e05ba8dfdaca0b93347, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b0ec932eb43f0b1101f9745f7a550b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/208a192816a3f28fc49e6ebcd5ccdd94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f1b8812bf684be2da608f57b78ea96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34faedb6380eea4d6e0a3d42add8e556, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47e1b4ecc1d31e1cb12961b6c913c99e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a992fdca7e5e856bbc9f808b05999d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ae48f63927eb7b1a0240485a6ab5ee6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ce846fd4b3d60e0e1e3090e8195e0af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cebadf16fc97da5755cb0f8bbf7a199, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e34a19243d804064d3eab163fae5e9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53a677c3f9a681257d43b28333a62614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688a27a851a31d9fe164d2cb6e7a2130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70c144e71b35b3e7b787e4cb01423df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/740b6f7ea797848374bd4a5f265b694c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7533b14f0115f0906b6083413f105984, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d7f6d51a7d2476e357f38573d6f6ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85b7efa1a84942f630266996a92afa17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86c78c084191f164c53dbee859dffe46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dc193a52abb53c7549ea1b0b90662a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a40be922437853add6b92a23d77834ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab1f8451cd1fabcf84b53174583ffabb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad0a639848c4a4143a27194a0af9e462, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af372e68b7365126d2798e9729819019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be728ecfb48cec162ac69aa6df5cc65c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bee3fb905b1b5a85629041f31878f02a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c92b32d010c2f6b701c5065a5303b659, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb29749a4fa5b3659ab3f924dfe23018, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7ec223c0acd966b1f9ecb9b482335de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9d01cca353fb469a4460ff455389f53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e048377db7ee79a4a1c8c09b5c6ecbd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8803f38ad6dee7728bc7756695bd6af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea62960397ce3af6bf54f7b2d0b56d5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eabe45f720ceee492fc15e91d431338b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb42b908186951c2168c21d0aad9ba7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed572b1e16d43d978ffe960b25b3ed3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edf07793288a673d4ffa03ee2a0e4afe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f99ebad75f43638231b045be4ee20038"

This dipeptide might be part of a hinge region (HR) that facilitates interdomain movements and thereby regulates (in time and space) autoprocessing of replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at eight sites that are conserved in arteriviruses. To test this hypothesis, we characterized nsp4 proteinase mutants carrying either point mutations in the putative HR domain or a large deletion in the CTD. When tested in a reverse genetics system, three groups of mutants were recognized (wild-type-like, debilitated, and dead), which was in line with the expected impact of mutations on HR flexibility. When tested in a transient expression system, the effects of the mutations on the production and turnover of replicase proteins varied widely. They were cleavage product specific and revealed a pronounced modulating effect of moieties derived from the nsp1-3 region of pp1a. Mutations that were lethal affected the efficiency of polyprotein autoprocessing most strongly. These mutants may be impaired in the accumulation of nsp5-7 and/or suffer from delayed or otherwise perturbed processing at the nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 junctions. On average, the production of nsp7-8 seems to be the most resistant to debilitating nsp4 mutations. Our results further prove that the CTD is essential for a vital nsp4 property other than catalysis.",""

Nurses are world’s largest health professional workforce and a critical resource for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Nonetheless, little is known about nurses’ engagement with dual practice. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature on nurses’ dual practice with the objective of generating hypotheses on its nature and consequences, and define a research agenda on the phenomenon. The Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological steps were followed to develop the research questions, identify relevant studies, include/exclude studies, extract the data, and report the findings. PRISMA guidelines were additionally used to conduct the review and report on results. RESULTS: Of the initial 194 records identified, a total of 35 met the inclusion criteria for nurses’ dual practice; the vast majority (65%) were peer-reviewed publications, followed by nursing magazine publications (19%), reports, and doctoral dissertations. Twenty publications focused on high-income countries, 16 on low- or middle-income ones, and two had a multi country perspective. Although holding multiple jobs not always amounted to dual practice, several ways were found for public-sector nurses to engage concomitantly in public and private employments, in regulated as well as in informal, casual fashions. Some of these forms were reported as particularly prevalent, from over 50% in Australia, Canada, and the UK, to 28% in South Africa. The opportunity to increase a meagre salary, but also a dissatisfaction with the main job and the flexibility offered by multiple job-holding arrangements, were among the reported reasons for engaging in these practices. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Limited and mostly circumstantial evidence exists on nurses’ dual practice, with the few existing studies suggesting that the phenomenon is likely to be very common and carry implications for health systems and nurses’ welfare worldwide. We offer an agenda for future research to consolidate the existing evidence and to further explore nurses’ motivation; without a better understanding of nurse dual practice, this will continue to be a largely ‘hidden’ element in nursing workforce policy and practice, with an unclear impact on the delivery of care.

We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection and that CS may contribute to this complication. METHODS: We retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. Differences in baseline factors, risk factors, and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPA. RESULTS: Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23 %) developed IPA 3 days after ICU admission. Five patients had proven and four had probable IPA. Significantly more IPA patients received CS within 7 days before ICU admission (78 versus 23 %, p = 0.002). IPA patients also received significantly higher doses of CS before ICU admission [hydrocortisone equivalent 800 (360–2,635) versus 0 (0–0) mg, p = 0.005]. On multivariate analysis, use of CS before ICU admission was independently associated with IPA [odds ratio (OR) 14.4 (2.0–101.6), p = 0.007]. CONCLUSIONS: IPA was diagnosed in 23 % of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 3 days after ICU admission. Our data suggest that use of CS 7 days before ICU admission is an independent risk factor for fungal superinfection. These findings may have consequences for clinical practice as they point out the need for increased awareness of IPA, especially in those critically ill H1N1 patients already receiving CS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0056f7a64865fcdc73330efbdb30ab54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d4213e93a20a173be1ac5561777f610, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1798454354bdf9c9d30c1b5e494d6754, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2679951ac06752fe650fb0095a714ba2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fffca47dc6789066f42cb5b608875a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/341ac68515b4ed48420bc826ecd7a738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/418c7663cbd6ded2a9f2d89ff0455d65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a3c6c27e9067200362fc342de10fd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bedf23d76e19510ffc94016a451cba0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e19d2ae12b79d1f5b494bfcaa42085b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e46351c89487a89aa976ac606d8b1a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fb1325ca5d050dd7a3b871aba36673a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61cec008d74b7b2f6cf449ac7de9b255, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66f7c495e0c1cab467aed0d3823a84e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68e7b980ef84695fcb691ca903ce899e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6af07d9770078033627ca19471cc2837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dd21f2534081b0df96165468c56ae98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b4aa97890fba49f04d9899d947c7d53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e7e50d431fb494f8b8a9c0859fe8a96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84d53f9ecf709f2852bc305886d371de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86b0d68609a5883ceed9914b9a10f631, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f5a124d447a8780fe44bcd8b1dada75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98494d142a3466eb3afdaf176f6e585a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a58bc82e085ffa57bf7ddbb63255b96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e32c1eba430a0f81bbaced2cc344122, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9feed96e9be6f2f4925fcdbee661a3d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a472b150aea849047cd6d86bb65017cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5763f426cc6d935c7985ceeb7512208, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c1d21f9e1c7aa60bd5462a11970ab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b640770477f1f9589cef4c4bb8bcd2e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba7b29c65bd670ecc53523d16307aa1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce09874901283db0144f01401c8a1de9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0f3b74c40040f4ebf42d94d7cbb4d34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db34ca4aec822e9bc3c27ad5fd841950, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd3707a9df99a763da0c749da8733fbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd4ce5dd6bbc9d4acdb6c14777af221e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9775230e11ea8784c1b06cdd528617e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebbc5ed3ac4c0dc7f3ffdacfb90873bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec3bb347b184a0fee4545a29e2e9db82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6b9f28102aff2ccc891c27838f180b8"

M2 is targeted to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, and the interaction of the viral proteins M2, M1, HA, and NA near glycolipid rafts in the apical plasma membrane is hypothesized to coordinate the assembly of infectious virus particles. To determine the role of M2 protein apical targeting in IAV replication, a panel of M2 proteins with basolateral plasma membrane (M2-Baso) or endoplasmic reticulum (M2-ER) targeting sequences was generated. MDCK II cells stably expressing M2-Baso, but not M2-ER, complemented the replication of M2-stop viruses. However, in primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures, viruses encoding M2-Baso and M2-ER replicated to negligible titers compared to those of wild-type virus. M2-Baso replication was negatively correlated with cell polarization. These results demonstrate that M2 apical targeting is essential for IAV replication: targeting M2 to the ER results in a strong, cell type-independent inhibition of virus replication, and targeting M2 to the basolateral membrane has greater effects in hNECs than in MDCK cells. IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus assembly and particle release occur at the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells. The integral membrane proteins encoded by the virus, HA, NA, and M2, are all targeted to the apical membrane and believed to recruit the other structural proteins to sites of virus assembly. By targeting M2 to the basolateral or endoplasmic reticulum membranes, influenza A virus replication was significantly reduced. Basolateral targeting of M2 reduced the infectious virus titers with minimal effects on virus particle release, while targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum resulted in reduced infectious and total virus particle release. Therefore, altering the expression and the intracellular targeting of M2 has major effects on virus replication.",""

Deletion analysis of cDNA constructs localized the protease domain within NS3 to the first 184 amino acids but did not eliminate the possibility that sequences within NS2B were also required for proper cleavage. Kinetic analysis of processing events in vitro and experiments to examine the sensitivity of processing to dilution suggested that an intramolecular cleavage between NS2A and NS2B preceded an intramolecular cleavage between NS2B and NS3.

Our findings suggest that polymorphisms of two IFN-inducible genes OAS-1 and MxA might affect susceptibility to the disease and progression of SARS at each level.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a1fdf435b9933c79f522f0786a3515c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1afad67304154af0133b99043a7e69d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2af1b65d48982f7cf45408f6da4cf59d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bbe0ac68e94bf1f3fbdbf9ce6357a2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41f7c80b112512f22eadc86d6c007ae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c59d392b184d2b64427595bba281943, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/543561f9291e652ad00d009f63ea37f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55e9a0ae1ba47dddde1f2ff564a51ed6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b95032e17d887ece7639482a2c3c8cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bce522cccdb94f78fe770480d8e2b7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c3e0c4e767a2c5578fb20ce47ff15d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61c755afa14a41a688f147d0ff74759a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6253180567bc81af87497f325474e7fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78bb3ddf160b07138a07caef9b03321c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83c460c7e8eb5b967d89bb48d79d86f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83fcb953f7a6569fae0710c8bfbed61b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9170756f7ca32cf8e11bea8eab7454ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91e86c6cdc88e84e3981929418ea9652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a61f95c9feeebb755f551b61cb495d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98ff16dbf51f5797984cca3903eeb47d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d8bc2daa5662437dd00f11dc5b91584, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a445c148f7e8333798c7059372d7ad2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a70d1502b6ae5ba2a6cb09e970ffcc09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a819688d2e20d26ffd45c1ebd7567e45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b04e2d91bdaf0417554a15d1582a1a27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d97242e8a9534c7340e381d4a72681dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0841556f7cbab327cb1f91535106803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e08c0d5da6c36c4db73981d77d329f22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0b98c63c134b9f9dfbbd40849df0ad1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0c64af29ffc29ab78a8b84d3fe112fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3e12272d010087161259c9a8334819d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f48ec8a6f9ba3cbe7df6a4bcbe2eddf9"

Current operative strategies include either direct nerve repair, nerve grafting, nerve transfer, or neurotization. The goal of this study is to compare muscle recovery using microneural repair versus neurotization in a rat model of chronic denervation. Methods Fifty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats had surgical denervation of the tibialis anterior muscle by transecting the common peroneal nerve. After 0, 8, 12, or 22 weeks of denervation, animals were assigned to either a direct repair or a neurotization cohort. An additional 7 animals were used for a sham cohort, and 7 of the 58 were used as controls. After a 12-week recovery period, animals had contractile strength and EMG testing of the tibialis anterior muscle. Peak force and characteristics were compared to the unoperated, contralateral limb. Tibialis anterior muscles were then harvested for mass and histologic evaluation. Results Sixty-two animals completed testing. Denervated controls demonstrated a significant decrease in muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor nerve conduction amplitude compared to sham animals. In all groups, chronicity of denervation adversely affected functional recovery. On average, repair animals performed better than neurotization animals with respect to muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor amplitude. Differences in contractile force, however, were significant only at the 0 week denervation group (94% ± 30 vs 50% ± 20, repair vs neurotization). Neurotized muscles processed for histologic analysis demonstrated acetylcholinesterase activity at the nerve-muscle interface, confirming the formation of motor end plates de novo. Conclusions We demonstrated that neurotization is capable of reinnervating de novo end plates in chronically denervated muscle. Our data do not support the hypothesis that direct muscle neurotization is superior to nerve repair for functional restoration of chronically denervated muscle. However, as the duration of denervation increases, the difference between outcomes of the neurotization and repair group narrows, suggesting that neurotization may offer a viable surgical alternative in the setting of prolonged denervation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3854bc9b4c5d6630747b63848d8e9b9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45767a1ab98fa296f78533ed1608051e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bb5bf26ec79092911f0f7b8dc99867a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7270529bed86467a33d5ec84aabccb4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9401de7dde9f3b509076242b2d29396e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f257268f283146e8e0e6423c8c62e69f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6db2394d60773c4504a77a66d30bb65"

The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. METHODS: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. RESULTS: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem–loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0406519046a7125f9d1f36a61ab72694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0522c477774cf0b8746ea9209d0cfdf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ed925d6fc8b280e9f162fa37b4fd03b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fc859a2c557213b9b122ea32a4c6656, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/255069f5f436b20afa109effc7a900da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296c191f23f9c6e6b16b63cc3bef9a0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d2fdf295d009eaa30d2e4952bcc303c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42af9e34ec390c655e3e3b0556f01825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42ea8c1160ed32e7ed73a881370c9c7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4826ba084f3da227a25a15062faed228, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50065a722f790855677b559118b7d707, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5958447c5872844bf45829d9799b57e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c1b4aed67e8fc9ce66a8c4e855ef90c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e4adb452dde9bbe2d2a91b1238a3a32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60fdb98e0135ea94405548414f3cf925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69f89543af75c7354184872b6c558c2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79925daafb77eefbae404527973805f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79f4011eb909daf0387090a498bcb02d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f07b4233472b3634680f6b68dc8b3f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80570d073e56077393c94548770a7737, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87e7544baeea2b837e00169b6ebbf583, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95371ff277484efae87a94abcf9da6a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/967d745f840369a5f6812c1b19d1b1ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97bf9ca6f38853b7aac9d4f8d64fee8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97d4d2ea2d89d7740443c7291db5cc1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad8e503423ff155d7abee32e1ea01ee7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b08cc955ba97e5e366a28b28ee441682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3c9c3bc7104665e5d1439e9c871bc62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc53838a0a61c9941f74118359eaf9ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c15cf06fd7d057d766fb95176a409d91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b2f3d4dab013d72c502f1b46904767, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3385843022ac3ba3cf39a0135657926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c76932497c86ba282e34e2df176e2815, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc99459826a4e6470de1e926e7f7261a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccd6d8398146f91b28126d1148b82968, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d94052f0ae54cd03d37386225f692e66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db4a5a9d54302ae2fe692a266ab6dda7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8a947cb8f38d7a3b5b019e06d174e7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0f5e2262e96926789e415256cad4d65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f97c192d3d16a416fa9392d9873b3569"

He demonstrated the nocturnal periodicity of microfilariae in the blood of patients with elephantiasis. These microfilariae undergo metamorphosis when ingested by the mosquito acting as the vector for the completion of their life cycle. Furthermore, he demonstrated the linkage between the lung fluke and endemic haemoptysis by finding operculated eggs in patients' sputa. He predicted that the miracidium from hatched eggs uses crustaceans, such as fresh-water snails found at tropical conditions, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle of many trematodes.

While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35. These computational models may provide preliminary insights into the molecular features that are responsible for their activity against Ebola virus in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19ce70c2bbde108b8cc0a29afe5d00ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/297f7c53a20e965eaa065ffccb744b17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b7e1cfab82ab7dc431830ceb6b2bfcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87227d951fe5bd9dc2d58fa6d18b4971, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3db9daf164be9e04553568b6a367b75"

Because HBoV is able to persist in the infected tissues, induces pro-fibrotic and pro- cancerogenic cytokines in vivo and in vitro, and is detected in colorectal and lung tumors, the virus may be involved in cancerogenesis at least as a cofactor. Recently it was shown that the adenotonsillar tissue is an important site of HBoV1 persistence and replication. Considering the background that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers were thought to be attributable to a HPV infection, a co-participation of HBoV in terms of a chronic virus infection might play a role in the cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tonsil tumor samples were screened for HBoV and HPV DNA. Positive tissue sections were afterward subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to identify HBoV and HPV infected cells. By use of an in vitro cell culture model with primary tonsil fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes infected by HBoV we tried to find the target cells of virus replication. MSI testing was based on a previously published protocol using a de-multiplexed PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device. Results: In total 62 of 103 (60, 19%) of the tonsil squamous cell carcinomas tested positive for HBoV DNA and 66 of 103 (66%) samples were identified as HPV positive. The FISH analysis revealed both double infection of HPV and HBoV in the same cells as well as single infections of both viruses within the tumor tissue. Twenty-two of 62 HBoV positive tumors tested HPV negative, 40 of 62 tissue sections were HBoV and HPV positive. We analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors for MSI. Of those four tonsils displayed MSI in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that human bocavirus infections as a cofactor may have an impact on tumor development in tonsils, although it still remains possible that HBoV solely displays a tumor tropism.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dc2c478f7e201116f86b381f640d574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d1f5462027b8888d570556206290e7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9adeb44d78ffffad504d7418e0975902, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c74ff56592ecb033e22b54a5c4bff29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a335538c49d565d9f8df1367bf4a5a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b512b758b5da2d4f312204e7100c3b8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df7a0d1d9e0f1d27ee34aad4b5ea7dbe"

Early detection of outbreaks is improved by systems that are comprehensive and specific with respect to the pathogen but are rapid in reporting the data. It has proven difficult to implement these requirements on a large scale while maintaining patient privacy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the automated export, aggregation, and analysis of infectious disease diagnostic test results from clinical laboratories across the United States in a manner that protects patient confidentiality. We hypothesized that such a system could aid in monitoring the seasonal occurrence of respiratory pathogens and may have advantages with regard to scope and ease of reporting compared with existing surveillance systems. METHODS: We describe a system, BioFire Syndromic Trends, for rapid disease reporting that is syndrome-based but pathogen-specific. Deidentified patient test results from the BioFire FilmArray multiplex molecular diagnostic system are sent directly to a cloud database. Summaries of these data are displayed in near real time on the Syndromic Trends public website. We studied this dataset for the prevalence, seasonality, and coinfections of the 20 respiratory pathogens detected in over 362,000 patient samples acquired as a standard-of-care testing over the last 4 years from 20 clinical laboratories in the United States. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens show influenza-like seasonality, rhinovirus has fall and spring peaks, and adenovirus and the bacterial pathogens show constant detection over the year. The dataset can also be considered in an ecological framework; the viruses and bacteria detected by this test are parasites of a host (the human patient). Interestingly, the rate of pathogen codetections, on average 7.94% (28,741/362,101), matches predictions based on the relative abundance of organisms present. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic Trends preserves patient privacy by removing or obfuscating patient identifiers while still collecting much useful information about the bacterial and viral pathogens that they harbor. Test results are uploaded to the database within a few hours of completion compared with delays of up to 10 days for other diagnostic-based reporting systems. This work shows that the barriers to establishing epidemiology systems are no longer scientific and technical but rather administrative, involving questions of patient privacy and data ownership. We have demonstrated here that these barriers can be overcome. This first look at the resulting data stream suggests that Syndromic Trends will be able to provide high-resolution analysis of circulating respiratory pathogens and may aid in the detection of new outbreaks.",""

However, the risk factors and the mechanism underlying this toxicity have not been elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells. Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-α-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α. These novel findings have significant implications in understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis and in NSCLC treatment.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/028abf7743b649c094001177ceff12d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02c16711a5eee255af28762538560d6b,

Recent studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from the two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of paramyxovirus fusion proteins could be used as inhibitors of virus fusion. The mechanism underlying this activity is in accordance with that of class I virus fusion proteins, of which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus fusion proteins are members. For class I virus fusion proteins, the HR1 fragment binds to HR2 to form a six-helix bundle with three HR1 fragments forming the central coiled bundle surrounded by three coiled HR2 fragments in the post fusion conformational state (fusion core). It is hypothesized that the introduced exogenous HR1 or HR2 can compete against their endogenous counterparts, which results in fusion inhibition. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model, we designed several protein inhibitors, denoted HR212 as well asHR121 and 5-Helix, which could bind the HR1 or HR2 region of fusion protein, respectively. All the proteins were expressed and purified using a GST-fusion expression system in Escherichia coli. The HR212 or GST-HR212 protein, which binds the HR1 peptide in vitro, displayed inhibitory activity against NDV-mediated cell fusion, while the HR121 and 5-Helix proteins, which bind the HR2 peptide in vitro, inhibited virus fusion from the avirulent NDV strain when added before the cleavage of the fusion protein. These results showed that the designed HR212, HR121 or 5-Helix protein could serve as specific antiviral agents. These data provide additional insight into the difference between the virulent and avirulent strains of NDV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0404feb49a14a3ff52d731ab3d78ba35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06682bd855bc24a7a7027cd2fe9dd71a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ecc346c0b9592a5235653149d01128b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/187866feedf167aa2b21272c26577f54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a9c3d0ee4432bf8f34481723aab90da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b473eebaf02b78fc04072e6cbd1702d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/276ec318b87978db27a5a65182092893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3234884d8b439fca55e29414060f4a73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3460aa2c5cf35975b9965a91347816d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34bc100c9ea2e95459654dbd25afb53b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3685e19a2f681b648f065aa41f0baf77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c82df41f8134f35fc32b02359dda57f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d9f77e1185ede3960decc28c4ac2fc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43f5fd6444aa35defaf63f4409bcf64b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d0bda2725165d926b4b8d91116dde76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6152bb58752acb8592f7816889c6473f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71d7274e8ddfe6f9d31d4852804a1056, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bc0017d38bb3b66ea3c9116d060f2c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cf8e19fe8be00c71e173474a0d5b34e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91ca8601012e944ef2d540cadf4bea23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93964d4703b77b82794700531a70fbc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0e07ceaf16dd3c82854b97061b31f43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a380a37e0baf5e9e6936f6f96fcbd180, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7f80df1d85ba799e1ac8628c282f78a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b55a24a7943854ed7f245dbff0f3f243, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6463bad96a57145bab7da783395c35f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc53dad0d3efab701e8b7618592f9a15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0cd83341fb3f01228ddbb19ab2e3118, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0d30eff3449b257592702167c9f5020, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c27b53914ac562ca762087f68b7fd152, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4468072a08924e56d66cabf7e39f540, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb25059e5a999ce429cdbfdaa53f5728, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ceb9b23f944a7c62c9dd44877e19f892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0ff2405916ffaf901f9017b85446ce2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d20d52b0d660dad2229e70e5d65510e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d414b1c6bc82d3cb0b70176ccbb8470f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d57e9d02af568945068ece9f4947c23a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daae3ad0cf759bec5f7353b7f82489a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df9535d58a3ff757d0a0528431138159, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dff79cb49683612f47a6c7c153bee443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0ccbbb742d8427f6dcebed2416570ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1f071aae88e436060131bb069216c7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e77dc19822862dd30abb50c608cf583e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee4be7c8935f384d387a993b2a214134, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef2a6537ac308e76655be76cd60de440, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3687e7a01fdcf0a3f5d6f4dfe7577c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb3065ef65a143fb0d94a6ce856ca257, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcea56518fa5f593b540ce5630b722d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fff0aec59979ae1ad12b15c175a908e8"

However, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations so other genes in the pathway could be potentially involved. IVIG is ineffective in mice lacking SIGN-R1, a related molecule to human DC-SIGN. Further, DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc, the component responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of IVIG. Thus, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN would also be involved in the pathway of IVIG response in Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients. FINDINGS: A case-control approach was performed to examine the differential distribution of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DC-SIGN promoter with IVIG-R among White (158 vs. 62), Asian (64 vs. 12) and Hispanic (55 vs. 20) KD patients. Distinct differences in allele frequency distributions of several variants in the DC-SIGN promoter were observed in the three ethnic groups. Further, Asians with the major allele “A” in rs2287886 were more likely (OR = 1.76, p = 0.04) to be IVIG non-responder, but this allele is a minor allele in other two ethnic groups, where the association was not apparent. CONCLUSIONS: DC-SIGN can potentially complement the role of FcγRIIB in the anti-inflammatory cascade involved in the IVIG response mechanism.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03916890084dda578769b8905e57c2dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05611990f27d0293cae26a71a75d58e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1527d67e2dfa77fa0d89c317977fd8c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16bfbcb71b4cb5f9878ac4c13bf22d18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17363ef2ea3379e81a70a5ffb79f948c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1db323b7e162c065778b60f8757b3ad0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f9a2a503627c34f0b6d9e85742511e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3612fd2469abaf11d7f79dc39f1193a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/363b5654a26811d61a99fe9abb15c9b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/378b318dec49cf65da80052f1dc43cf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bd76b13fed1e13e07932d7059deb6ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41bff8d5b6ae0291390511ae61ab18a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43945e16ecff1df0706a640605f09d49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e314d2e815af15e8f2f3af3a514e3a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ec970f7d74b290d981db10c61c550ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5135b6f9317644adc51fe1bb8475c7a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5840baface3a15fe92a285ef1d2dfda0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/671c3681d1b8dd9a787d1c2bfba83a84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ad40d3e25cd320d7d598a066d4ade6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b1278c9d0e305726bc507be954cbf37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7676148d81bf2ed0e2c144ef72f914f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8131e3f8eb32190cb69dd1d5c1caa965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8223d9df7487d8f83df2c1dd78c2178c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8745053d7578ea385f2465b84506abff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88bcf14b38cc5b16f0dee35adce0cc45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d562ee2c1ee2d2a4f201d904d84b8d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d74d78b705ec25d0d6923bb7ebd390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a549aa89ea1522cc6941ec61447a2c5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a942b76d0bb66b33551489bc60b93aa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aacf216855a09320c0fa271ab368ed65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b05f7327e3f1407be9596492dfe0e914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1f612f0d477339114f9ab4d1fcdd40d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b950afbc0f9ccdd954975b700ded580b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba0fbab482bae6745bd2b71ccede03fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6e8f9372826061a7b5b8da8c45b47e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d39f3fc41aa19ac39cde46f244a08fa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5656c87da5e1b19922d5e9480832d2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21e4bb07ad0191baa743c0b3b2feaea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3dc7cc5d2249dd024272b499ef3350e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea99b3aa8ed780b39ee85cfcc51ede4a"

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are just two of the most widely reported recent emerging infectious diseases. What are the factors that contribute to the rapid evolution of viral species? Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving opportunities for virus spread (for example, agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest clearing or air travel). However, the nutritional status of the host, until recently, has not been considered a contributing factor to the emergence of infectious disease. In this review, we show that host nutritional status can influence not only the host response to the pathogen, but can also influence the genetic make-up of the viral genome.

Most HIV-1 vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity. Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1. We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized hamsters. RESULTS: We amplified and characterized 14 different gp120s from primary subtype B isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins. However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E CONCLUSION: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/154bb000e876a02f69d53464b403480d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a01ca1b0246400c2b31e96b0f7d5873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25fce1883a4e26063e7e4442d14ae9f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dd8082f91a9af7c2df0c6884a2d7f67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42e6697ffa521685e01f82e3afe9fae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/488a603831e4f6d3367eb1497999bd81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79f94a9db0cd2c26d3e02157efcdeac3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/839e9de7d03ea125a68cd0a34276472b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87f3ae7c327e6a06f46af9b6f811f837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d60531a72772748fb7ad0aa6005d038, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b845eeb65456758f8913770c3a1f39a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8423c34a7d7d02a5e3691fbab849040, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd23cb34221f9cdf204b44498e2f5ec6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d810e3fe62188ec01aa106f49a4382d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de15800b02fcadfb1dbea7992fd0f3d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2d5f1b0c98d8756fcf890707ae81faa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edc12b8c24e3d2fe2da57ae74b149491, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f503c7d89c53e7df80808032fc6aa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa2148fec6653187487a3cf6567e3a20"

For this purpose, we have analyzed the results of molecular dynamics simulations where all possible conformational and aggregational space was systematically explored. Two main assumptions were considered; the first is that protein E contains one transmembrane α-helical domain, with its N- and C-termini located in opposite faces of the lipid bilayer. The second is that protein E forms the same type of transmembrane oligomer and with identical backbone structure in different coronaviruses. The models arising from the molecular dynamics simulations were tested for evolutionary conservation using 13 coronavirus protein E homologous sequences. It is extremely unlikely that if any of our assumptions were not correct we would find a persistent structure for all the sequences tested. We show that a low energy dimeric, trimeric and two pentameric models appear to be conserved through evolution, and are therefore likely to be present in vivo. In support of this, we have observed only dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric aggregates for the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E in SDS. The models obtained point to residues essential for protein E oligomerization in the life cycle of the SARS virus, specifically N15. In addition, these results strongly support a general model where transmembrane domains transiently adopt many aggregation states necessary for function.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01257fdcf27bc7734c83ecd8c4abdffd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0481ecfd3000a11dbb59c567273b8ae6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/058d7e465c6e755ea62e72edeea8afc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c79f6d2f283122725012cf6b665bb4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f3a535fca3f4ac4dcff5ca578716e35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f7ea095ea7e120b2ce7a49c90a87c4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25aec3b9fd89df6317e180a028b56c5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/266227b436de6a07cfc99a84b7bc8744, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39d5c916b569706e7abe56927af2d388, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42579a07a90321a51199fb015108703e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44ee31511c3d22b7fa958fef08627424, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a1c84e0e03a7c3bf92f1e3671b124af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dc4a8f174be59fde034555b4ef1665d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/508c65e0be7a30233d7869867f0122dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64db16eed49bfa7f6efde0ee4178b709, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dfcf9b0ca6b6857a3912b72d2bd4f7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a4be427f034df5aa5a558541fc43029, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84770145028db2005fff87e3c2e7ae58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bf3d643d0bb849d3c387c0451ad2bec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ff22496533694b4618d3b3b08714f7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95059a57f2f1281a88006bd26c21bb22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9907ba0d27f5a8e87b2a6e3b70f4aafc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a438bfadfcf91d4f93204d7970a1e481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5462f096938990205c4f84030a84430, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a66f30f017081d20c6720d2361c406c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7431afd00120960ad77c10b2363d6bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da581ec94b0d43b0f09ae447d73331d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db8ad412bc0ab47dfc5a809c2f11231d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e180cf7e6863166007add5b3a1a5fdd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ead23d281e429f83314ab661804d837e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee58a79a9adeb4633abab8d43e559719, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f26fef7dad32ec57081d5b1bf5d259bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3cbd9c1dfe891c4ee1f10aad47162c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f53879dc69ae68b03e072c279c1cc5b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fecf0a0e2bff5794ed913d2214ec878a"

While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07c7b4442ef2ff62d48a5d541d7b254b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/126b6ee80704fb09f33153915ad213bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14474ae1569d145b9c4472ee7f76412b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e4db08045163de538371fdd90fa7aff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/346c39fe5790b2e921a90feab68093c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afb26466f2398913880bae14325f9555, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf8131630c116a384f9b4c61c2631c48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3efe852b0b64f16a95530d60fe1993b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce92c92cd9cfbd987485ef5e7886559b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eabb38565d080a4ebdaae82cc94cbcd6"

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of ‘protein homeostasis system’; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.",""

Explanatory hypotheses included direct and indirect vaccine effects. In a randomized placebo-controlled ferret study, we tested whether prior receipt of 2008–09 TIV may have directly influenced A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. Thirty-two ferrets (16/group) received 0.5 mL intra-muscular injections of the Canadian-manufactured, commercially-available, non-adjuvanted, split 2008–09 Fluviral or PBS placebo on days 0 and 28. On day 49 all animals were challenged (Ch0) with A(H1N1)pdm09. Four ferrets per group were randomly selected for sacrifice at day 5 post-challenge (Ch+5) and the rest followed until Ch+14. Sera were tested for antibody to vaccine antigens and A(H1N1)pdm09 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), nucleoprotein-based ELISA and HA1-based microarray assays. Clinical characteristics and nasal virus titers were recorded pre-challenge then post-challenge until sacrifice when lung virus titers, cytokines and inflammatory scores were determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-naïve animals. Antibody rise to vaccine antigens was evident by ELISA and HA1-based microarray but not by HI or MN assays; virus challenge raised antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 by all assays in both groups. Beginning at Ch+2, vaccinated animals experienced greater loss of appetite and weight than placebo animals, reaching the greatest between-group difference in weight loss relative to baseline at Ch+5 (7.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.01). At Ch+5 vaccinated animals had higher lung virus titers (log-mean 4.96 vs. 4.23pfu/mL, respectively; p = 0.01), lung inflammatory scores (5.8 vs. 2.1, respectively; p = 0.051) and cytokine levels (p>0.05). At Ch+14, both groups had recovered. Findings in influenza-naïve, systematically-infected ferrets may not replicate the human experience. While they cannot be considered conclusive to explain human observations, these ferret findings are consistent with direct, adverse effect of prior 2008–09 TIV receipt on A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. As such, they warrant further in-depth investigation and search for possible mechanistic explanations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00376575d1c656a0ba84796e39cc8af7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/039003807d4418e4317c638137b74a15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0410828a0303013b2a31a68e6d94b223, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1510cc680d152c675e9399f2f312b4e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19e49d75cee4096450c9d92632ff9a06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a28b5e0955930d4ea12f6297a1a403f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e7a6e4b352b9c687895f00680694a63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e7e8a28254ddaac0c00cb0502b98f10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1eace7b2c34fbea4a239264790233e34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21b2e88a8a81946b7fdcbc551f5d43ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e31a22fb20ba888c11bb5e1e64cbe9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/362d00524fe50f8d396cb19c108db71f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bbfd8ccc62d897c5ede24bf257b5a7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cd2b0716205a246b399c2223fd90fcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43d1e7d6eb0aa728fe0cfe7cc3308793, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4618c947152122a9ae49f70b609151f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f98fdb6817dfa51b27f7eef9e9ea844, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52aab9f1b24a77c4f27dd35caea37ae5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/620acc5276cb9ff1c5c0dfb6ee8c1745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/685cbdad7c0f1b21815da855fbdf493d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d117d160fe767b91bba7285876b30e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72c44d33a7f4a939adba09c7a4ef9e16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73f6c9f7d5c90fb886184f545b73d1a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75fedccb3c980cf8a8bab517d3069426, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7758202e5c72a35c5c59d89aba1847c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8058201d8b279f03ecc3930890b77193, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82fa503aed690f90951a8f349b7b0bc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/833ab2a0d63e346204235c7e99088282, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83fd2f9e0dc3e24bb26d92acbedc9d86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8957c91cf6806ad820fc21ab734eb301, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e3820a0d66d0b04f095a7656282f32f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913cc14745a9a00c3f7c356c9e8e1a47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91f283249e302cd5e19f8c18221a76ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/949f0817a4a9667d8bd725377187a190, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aa877bd99b867bf259040783d2161c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ad38abe8c80e56182b6d91f3f429032, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b66fcf807df29b5fde0172d9b4e1c018, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b719ec07195623c6c906d14de75abeee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b80eb9f25e91ea6914948086c77aa578, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5141e0471c24013a72dacf594ba7025, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9c226b04491203d45a05437be0bfc80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d54cec503420c483a5b770936f792eac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d959a2690e0970e7d9d10d577b4e4acd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9f40f7f57dac1c9837f98a2e277a23d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db63c8ab3a62bb72f4d4ba802538918b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcb596427663e0d81e524a9af58422cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e60ea7c4e93822990a96f8560d0a2b82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8a9e007dbb64848f4ad04077fbb27bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd5ea1a0635198829b49904fbb6c5209"

Children infected with HAdV were 3 times more likely (p < 0.001) to have AOM with or without perforation. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a positive association between nasopharyngeal bacterial load and clinical ear state, exacerbated by respiratory viruses, in Indigenous children. HAdV was independently associated with acute ear states.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/097345b4605f8b89d571966c58317bd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21133e3445548811d42aca03b0fb3c4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25cb693abef3f7c8a26cfa6c3286b620, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4686547fca3de073ea888f019e68158f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50535c9794f2d92ac2fa70d15560aeee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6944d37d7e2ec60e2344bee7018c42df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a5c60ce1f2b0669b8ef14acc20d5dd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3af4ad1208bc7d9b33cce43691832d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee5a80ceb2009354a039b9ae7c422190"

So far, the structure determination of the SARS-CoV NP CTD in solution has been impeded by the poor quality of NMR spectra, especially for aromatic resonances. We have recently developed the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method to overcome the size problem of NMR structure determination by utilizing a protein exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically isotope-labeled amino acids. Here, we employed the SAIL method to determine the high-quality solution structure of the SARS-CoV NP CTD by NMR. The SAIL protein yielded less crowded and better resolved spectra than uniform 13C and 15N labeling, and enabled the homodimeric solution structure of this protein to be determined. The NMR structure is almost identical with the previously solved crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. Studies of the chemical shift perturbations caused by the binding of single-stranded DNA and mutational analyses have identified the disordered region at the N-termini as the prime site for nucleic acid binding. In addition, residues in the β-sheet region also showed significant perturbations. Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01e8bcf7fac59056b8251de64cef79e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/045a7ec194230b02f9ff584a6105f652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10c0a53ab5fb09f9485b2c9cc69c2109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1acfa6cbb72648220fae00f650625930, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bbb52ca7e2fe9a94281b1d65f3d8873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d18486ad3ed0bc1b97b95c7c57a8aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26da0868307772784b1abc2620a2e5d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/287901e2dc18dc477f786fbdf392aa7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31e645faec959179aebc07adcbc43b22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/340ff8d62609d6d8fe2c825970261797, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a4305c83d42be267186a33a53e46548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ece5ea8d12d111c95a1df56447f7c29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/408dd61df3601d3b2fc47a21ac9f4d89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41ef65382a32106e136a88e7f27bf74b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d3d329f28d35048e72b1771f304dabd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d8e2ab8a3099a11d58556b50809d3a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5070029ca7e3b8760f0bb1c4f87f301e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50e52a0cd0826af495939afe6adf99fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5212d920419df5cd86cdac7aeabb3394, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5596ebfd632d2f9119b213683139e624, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5930ac90b0d6a5339fdbcf231ef82599, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c573558819995f5d3437d302c70fbed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7117918d6c628183ffdc6c67e3498390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75336046708b74b092a11ef282a62a84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83896759e6f67c04f43c2c7796da2637, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/937c2db04b6ba993f7d5de44f178dd46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/944367db629ad78100e2d9a94267476a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d3b1e389c342253d12dfd396b2d7ddf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a406201308ad5b6bd2633302bc21e47b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4e4bc39a1fb7085807489caf712f404, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a746987d6aae99fdd5c1d8cc3bfa9826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab0d110218560b50c769bb5a09b55882, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af3404cb8142cbe3c1a6a1976580f8c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b933fadd5d00c5db193e639541d51385, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc538aa2acc15b109e60283d45f53a98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be7aaf64b843138ef84fa178fc9287b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bffbc474a14fe464289078e54e3fb56b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c11b0f92f46b39e8edc3ea944440f81d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1ab1e11700e0d0d5d5884d248087147, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3c619b4f11f4b26b484120f80bda1f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc9c27933f6e6463ca71133fcb74a737, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d33d5c0f93e21a2abc987e4ffd2ec88e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db760040246e66bf1f8a9128cc488356, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df7174e2508a967719c703a0f35f790d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4a3cc01ac32ae523f1c0cf202afa914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb6d2e0f8b7eebafdd2f53d402a3e49f"

However, 10–20% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia which contributes to considerable morbidity. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood. The present study investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and host human components. METHODOLOGY: Bioinformatic tools were used to identify peptides of CHIKV E1 exhibiting similarity to host components. Two peptides (A&B) were identified using several bioinformatic tools, synthesised and used to validate the results obtained in silico. An ELISA was designed to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples from CHIKV patients to these peptides. Further, experiments were conducted in a C57BL/6J experimental mouse model to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were indeed capable of inducing pathology. FINDINGS: The serum samples showed reactivity of varying degrees, indicating that these peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection. Further, these peptides when injected into C57BL/6J mice were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice, similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology in the skeletal muscles as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone. Collectively these observations validate the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 protein and host proteins does contribute to pathology in CHIKV infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01a0c08322687de3af2a0df7309ad318, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e623577344ce2f28215ad7cc39272b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/133d9c325a18ddef599f800326c73e8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b053711e022c93b37b8d08ff3f2b5da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ea0be6cd838b6e75143ebfc628988b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7508ef7fe48d974468ddff563ab273aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80bae5c27a1ca2e50fe85b081a08be0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8aaabb26bc8fdfe5bcf08fc58c9d1e65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b69e0db59b12f4cc090886152446254e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b99e345056762c0b77977c0ee695ea44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d98c43e88d0db2ae356e1026912a624c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8218fbd4761d250b802666931a16afb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f841d026dee1f0737c7ed1efcceb39fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb1ba4a3c11a77bfacfe99d905c9e2ac"

The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a820ded3ea1dcd23f10970185451393, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10ce09e1c626f9a630a3541ed7c075de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15cec39dc3453b480a442007cefcb3ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25aefe05f6214046fae4eb1647dbb489, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e419c54f8004916e0509aaf0e54b9e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3eeb058ab8d6284da94269502c27086b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45a0a3fd9d923a5a309fc4df1715a710, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a531724d4f8a9229a5ab18d29638f88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e78c257735461d0ff90abc902f204a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55528d49c4590c9feb724cf7a8ec5ec0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55e5d66c8bb708e40af241c0e74c983f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5703ccaece037a4d72b1de345e8812a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/632a3ef4ae0e38624fc0a265ae203ab6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6390b9bb0fff7b5b15bd68dd362bb8d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c0c14ff5575f98948f3dee63cff7188, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/767e253d54cdf6b47bfc64fb2a4a27bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a67a60ba1cb069b85b4c50491510323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/820fbcb03308486b42575d547caf6276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9671bcf47b36b463111f05532e265cd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f352c3625ca845d6b46dbca2f1e3c18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa96c9f1f05ae624e9ad552472cec034, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bba4a132ab481382338cffe4e5821cc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcfb1559886e89ddfff76b3ca478401b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6fbd55439362d06daa8b665c22fe38b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0d75fdb8a6b6339e2240f5b9bf1f9c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e94d33e9aff697d1926db3191d6ccbc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea3042313b3d8bf10681201061bd9257, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff4dbcf8bd7c6f9c1e50ef6a148149f2"

We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) on the expression of AP-2 in breast cancer cells. Here, we provide evidence that TNF-α downregulates AP-2α and AP-2γ expression posttranscriptionally during TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Both a general caspase antagonist (zVADfmk) and a caspase 6-preferred antagonist (zVEIDfmk) inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis and AP-2α downregulation. In vivo tests showed that AP-2α was cleaved by caspases ahead of the DNA fragmentation phase of apoptosis. Recombinant caspase 6 cleaved AP-2α preferentially, although caspases 1 and 3 also cleaved it, albeit at 50-fold or higher concentrations. Activated caspase 6 was detected in TNF-α-treated cells, thus confirming its involvement in AP-2α cleavage. All three caspases cleaved AP-2α at asp(19) of the sequence asp-arg-his-asp (DRHD(19)). Mutating D(19) to A(19) abrogated AP-2α cleavage by all three caspases. TNF-α-induced cleavage of AP-2α in vivo led to AP-2α degradation and loss of DNA-binding activity, both of which were prevented by pretreatment with zVEIDfmk. AP-2α degradation but not cleavage was inhibited in vivo by PS-431 (a proteasome antagonist), suggesting that AP-2α is degraded subsequent to cleavage by caspase 6 or caspase 6-like enzymes. Cells transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged mutant AP-2α are resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, further demonstrating the link between caspase-mediated cleavage of AP-2α and apoptosis. This is the first report to demonstrate that degradation of AP-2α is a critical event in TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Since the DRHD sequence in vertebrate AP-2 is widely conserved, its cleavage by caspases may represent an important mechanism for regulating cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.",""

One major contributor to the decline are pathogens, including several honey bee viruses. However, information is limited on the biology of bee viruses and molecular interactions with their hosts. An experimental protocol to test these systems was developed, using injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) into honey bee pupae reared ex-situ under laboratory conditions. The infected pupae developed pronounced but variable patterns of disease. Symptoms varied from complete cessation of development with no visual evidence of disease to rapid darkening of a part or the entire body. Considerable differences in IAPV titer dynamics were observed, suggesting significant variation in resistance to IAPV among and possibly within honey bee colonies. Thus, selective breeding for virus resistance should be possible. Gene expression analyses of three separate experiments suggest IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis of several fundamental cellular functions, including an up-regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These results provide first insights into the mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity. They mirror a transcriptional survey of honey bees afflicted with Colony Collapse Disorder and thus support the hypothesis that viruses play a critical role in declining honey bee health.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03d5ad9a731a1f365429456a16baf8bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0587c7d053178c2d1f719674d55b4b78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07fc604909862cdee0ad87c741b7e45c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b3c2b5d7b2036656b397c41fedad325, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e08c24bf75ed690aba881868b67c292, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/222d315538389283dd2e77f2aeb08ac8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d2ebc38e469d1cace747c286ccc20f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bb595a7a3b4469f7848ec4b6a535979, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cbd16fb54ec06baa6f9adbad2e4c191, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e2f8917f2b9c22e020b8db7c6a81d67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e7cdde3f61490fc62b5988d56e76fba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/444b7d6f05789b832282bc56366a3a7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49f393b538274825d934a53a90fed22a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e864c6441f2f987d814a7cde5e7eabd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53def856084fd5403715f18ebe028634, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58cc3e4b5216c2323041ab94c0995965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/644f20c615080a07c49c02b504438bc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67405f3035b5ec0db13b06d48e0dc418, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79f4f6e912805d918eb486b331361ec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7be531bf71e350405e55cbfc2b113d5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80ad86c53558f7241ce73c2c43d7ae9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ca61b5eae870b812b29f649e24d1e05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7cc0a10801f8073b4a0855673c0ca00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8cd03b7de4fc87beb31d28e89158cd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd22cc08a5cc881ecce73022b9369e0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf312e3be5df53f7e2bc014634a62691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b2affe75af079bfc5439d7756b8cb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d472bf45f8d7f66cb6875886888bb8e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de3b0e4946ae3e654aca3d2935627007, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6fcec20336534e6ab6a8f895e27447e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e75a44d4fa7ef53cb5c8f10f9f3aa0e7"

However, for viruses that fuse inside of intracellular compartments, fusion-inhibitory peptides have exhibited very low antiviral activity. We propose that for these viruses, too, membrane targeting via cholesterol conjugation may yield potent compounds. Here we compare the activity of fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and show that although the unconjugated peptides are inactive, the cholesterol-conjugated compounds are effective inhibitors of infectivity and membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the cholesterol moiety, by localizing the peptides to the target cell membrane, allows the peptides to follow the virus to the intracellular site of fusion. The cholesterol-conjugated peptides trap HA in a transient intermediate state after fusion is triggered but before completion of the refolding steps that drive the merging of the viral and cellular membranes. These results provide proof of concept for an antiviral strategy that is applicable to intracellularly fusing viruses, including known and emerging viral pathogens.",""

It has been demonstrated that herds can remain free from these infections for several years also in high prevalence areas. Organically managed (OM) dairy herds have been shown to have lower seroprevalence of both viruses compared to conventionally managed (CM) herds. The objective of this study was to challenge the hypothesis of a lower occurrence of BRSV and BoCV in OM compared to CM dairy herds. In November 2011, May 2012 and May 2013 milk samples from four homebred primiparous cows were collected in 75 to 65 OM and 69 to 62 CM herds. The antibody status regarding BRSV and BoCV was analysed with commercial indirect ELISAs. Herds were classified as positive if at least one individual sample was positive. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive herds ranged from 73.4% to 82.3% for BRSV and from 76.8% to 85.3% for BoCV among OM and CM herds, over the three sampling occasions. There was no statistically significant difference between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion. The incidence risk of newly infected herds did not differ statistically between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion, neither for BRSV nor for BoCV. The incidence of herds turning sero-negative between samplings corresponded to the incidence of newly infected. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were also sampled in the herds and analysed. Several herds were negative on individual samples but positive in BTM. Herd-level data on production, health and reproduction were retrieved from VÄXA Sweden and the study herds were representative of the source population. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in prevalence of or incidence risk for BRSV or BoCV between Swedish OM and CM herds. Because the incidence of herds becoming seropositive was balanced by herds becoming seronegative it should be possible to lower the prevalence of these two infections among Swedish dairy cattle herds if biosecurity is improved.

Studies on the modes of transmission of SARS are limited though a number of outbreak studies have revealed the possible airborne route. To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of fomite transmission in the well-known Ward 8A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness. Our results reveal that under the assumed conditions, the SARS coronavirus was most possible to have spread via the combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, and that the fomite route played a non-negligible role in the transmission.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/199b512ebf84c9868794a0c35348393f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31e315934c9be2d43a798e7d3f3e32f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/334736c34bce7cf1a588772ede0288c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/442bf194bcf81d593ab310f20e6712b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6622d7a911894f819a778c217b3fb1fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e5bad85a3d07a3c7928e8e975df399f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fb312e54978de008b23358bccb322c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80ae1121fd43380f45c059905fe6c078, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/814646d86997f8f078dfed6f0d8e564b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9082130d1e1a070975bdee2aa1253ebb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/924bd67a13aa70a93787f58565fbba09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1f59a2b03aa911b0667033c249c081, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6555e8d38062cee4dd19d8409e7c49f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e13a8b25dec9db6529c558b1a5360e98"

Among various cytokines implicated in liver ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, type I IFNs have been described recently as playing an essential role in its pathogenesis. Moreover, type I IFNs have been shown to up-regulate hepatocyte expression of IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a key transcription factor that regulates apoptosis and induces liver damage after I/R. Our aim was to ascertain the capacity of IFN-α released by liver pDC to induce liver damage through hepatic IRF-1 up-regulation after I/R injury. Our findings show that liver pDC mature and produce IFN-α in response to liver I/R. Liver pDC isolated after I/R induced elevated levels of IRF-1 production by hepatocytes compared with liver pDC isolated from sham-operated mice. Notably, hepatic IRF-1 expression was reduced significantly by neutralizing IFN-α. In vivo, IFN-α neutralization protected the liver from I/R injury by reducing hepatocyte apoptosis. This was associated with impaired expression of IRF-1 and pro-apoptotic molecules such as Fas ligand, its receptor (Fas) and death receptor 5 which are regulated by IRF-1. Furthermore, pDC-depleted mice failed to up-regulate hepatic IFN-α and displayed less liver injury associated with reduced levels of hepatic IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and hepatocyte apoptosis after I/R compared with controls. Conclusion: these data support the hypothesis that IFN-α derived from liver pDC plays a key role in the pathogenesis of liver I/R injury by enhancing apoptosis as a consequence of induction of hepatocyte IRF-1 expression.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/160429cfb809b306048936105e39bfb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d21d0ceb03bf3b63955b969a6e8abe5,

Recent phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that this pathogenic fungus arrived in the PNW approximately 7 to 9 decades ago. In this paper, we theorize that the ancestors of the PNW C. gattii clones arrived in the area by shipborne transport, possibly in contaminated ballast, and established themselves in coastal waters early in the 20th century. In 1964, a tsunami flooded local coastal regions, transporting C. gattii to land. The occurrence of cryptococcosis in animals and humans 3 decades later suggests that adaptation to local environs took time, possibly requiring an increase in virulence and further dispersal. Tsunamis as a mechanism for the seeding of land with pathogenic waterborne microbes may have important implications for our understanding of how infectious diseases emerge in certain regions. This hypothesis suggests experimental work for its validation or refutation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10d91019999fefef8200269ad42b6aca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b055a5eef37f810eb69f8ac0a93e63d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/267010382af3ae714eed03711dcc9657, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b12eaf7a2ef2b37384957271f107e1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e56c63372a46b51d7b933c4ced5465, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/728a7c5fc93478e6811a7520e0a10012, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77389a8156af9d1d5fc318b333ef775c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bfb1e6b699158f947fd3c928f22df66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b067177a9b8c351e20f15b6744bf7369, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b817349ee000c894e8e416fb8dc87f97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf56c4452d82e18dcee3ae44cef533af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee59f58bba1a447e897ee77d1d19a3eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f70c5f12cae7d490ae2695362faf071a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fed03562a665f430db7c8c13b8ea6cb0"

Rearrangements of the cytoskeleton in producer and target cells are required for proper targeting of viral and cellular components during synapse formation, yet little is known about how these processes are regulated, particularly within the producer cell. Since ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins connect F-actin with integral and peripheral membrane proteins, are incorporated into virions, and interact with cellular components of the virological presynapse, we hypothesized that they play roles during the late stage of HIV-1 replication. Here we document that phosphorylated (i.e., active) ezrin specifically accumulates at the HIV-1 presynapse in T cell lines and primary CD4(+) lymphocytes. To investigate whether ezrin supports virus transmission, we sought to ablate ezrin expression in producer cells. While cells did not tolerate a complete knockdown of ezrin, even a modest reduction of ezrin expression (∼50%) in HIV-1-producing cells led to the release of particles with impaired infectivity. Further, when cocultured with uninfected target cells, ezrin-knockdown producer cells displayed reduced accumulation of the tetraspanin CD81 at the synapse and fused more readily with target cells, thus forming syncytia. Such an outcome likely is not optimal for virus dissemination, as evidenced by the fact that, in vivo, only relatively few infected cells form syncytia. Thus, ezrin likely helps secure efficient virus spread not only by enhancing virion infectivity but also by preventing excessive membrane fusion at the virological synapse. IMPORTANCE While viruses, in principal, can propagate through successions of syncytia, HIV-1-infected cells in the majority of cases do not fuse with potential target cells during viral transmission. This mode of spread is coresponsible for key features of HIV-1 pathogenesis, including killing of bystander cells and establishment of latently infected T lymphocytes. Here we identify the ERM protein family member ezrin as a cellular factor that contributes to the inhibition of cell-cell fusion and thus to suppressing excessive syncytium formation. Our analyses further suggest that ezrin, which connects integral membrane proteins with actin, functions in concert with CD81, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins. Additional evidence, documented here and elsewhere, suggests that ezrin and CD81 cooperate to prevent cytoskeleton rearrangements that need to take place during the fusion of cellular membranes.",""

Establishment of chronic infection by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis depends on its subversion of host immune responses. This includes blocking the ability of infected macrophages to be activated by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) for clearance of this intracellular pathogen. To define the mechanism by which M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis subverts this critical host cell function, patterns of signal transduction to IFN-γ stimulation of uninfected and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected bovine monocytes were determined through bovine-specific peptide arrays for kinome analysis. Pathway analysis of the kinome data indicated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, a hallmark of IFN-γ signaling, in uninfected monocytes. In contrast, IFN-γ stimulation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes failed to induce patterns of peptide phosphorylation consistent with JAK-STAT activation. The inability of IFN-γ to induce differential phosphorylation of peptides corresponding to early JAK-STAT intermediates in infected monocytes indicates that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis blocks responsiveness at, or near, the IFN-γ receptor. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased expression of negative regulators of the IFN-γ receptors SOCS1 and SOCS3 as well as decreased expression of IFN-γ receptor chains 1 and 2 is observed in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes. These patterns of expression are functionally consistent with the kinome data and offer a mechanistic explanation for this critical M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis behavior. Understanding this mechanism may contribute to the rational design of more effective vaccines and/or therapeutics for Johne's disease.",""

In this article, we review the following: (i) the steps employed by the RdRP to incorporate a correct nucleotide; (ii) the steps that are employed by the RdRP for nucleotide selection; (iii) the structure-based hypothesis for nucleotide selection; (iv) the impact of sites remote from the active site on polymerase fidelity. Given the recent observation that RNA viruses exist on the threshold of error catastrophe, the studies reviewed herein suggest novel strategies to perturb RdRP fidelity that may lead ultimately to the development of antiviral agents to treat RNA virus infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1767eea37d0b20f09e134a45b3936b7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2627e3259836efbe5ba79def7699d681, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28bcda962e37b470c275a03f199f7ddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f5c10decd8b4f327e7a17e923b83ea2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a0bbc25c3376c8a2336817026a8fcfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c43646472b8fce541999889640eb63a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61c0fd48f73ffcd095291aa5186d28eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62597bd9b0891a69232bb2119e1553ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7094f31036e876569c1f1a308d4b9ca6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7623ab47d6cede90ca6389d7718f49f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8143c6851b4d8edd7013645e684e063d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b1d5b8c7d3d0afddafd253e8a3a9ae2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90852f7f7928ab78382b62176c7a4ed2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92d9899048b027fdc6a0a833c31a1cf7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/970247f68cac1280de004f78f61d76de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/972079d51f2d39cc7b1a726ab5f2efff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a04ef47cc8881ea4fb7332dd286c8215, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae1e4eca69200ccc9bf0d99c55f27dc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdb06165fa649d4df8e697fe517502fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5d32bbfe49b8b86408bef73bbf8a67c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d73f0c8d64cb7f1b85171cdc04c60d03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d86b14462159c18c9de82cfa08e1c7b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edebd4fbbae682b3f23256406de69d66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc2594450e9d8ac7ec528430becf0d16"

Deletion mutants could be selected only after multiple passage of virus through cultured cell lines; minimally passaged MHV-4 stocks contained putative point mutants selectable by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies but no deletions. Enhanced growth of deletion mutants relative to wild-type virus was observed in four cell lines used for virus propagation and was attributed to delayed and diminished cytopathic effects that allowed cultures to support virus production for prolonged periods. This hypothesis was reinforced by the finding that no selective advantage for the deletion mutants was observed in two cell lines resistant to virus-induced cytopathic effects.

While producing a global cellular effect, proteasome inhibitors have not triggered the catastrophe articulated initially in terms such as “buildup of cellular garbage”. Proteasome inhibitors, in fact, do have a therapeutic window, although in the case of the prototype bortezomib it is small owing to peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression and, as recently reported, cardiotoxicity [1]. Currently, several second-generation molecules are undergoing clinical evaluation to increase this window. An alternative strategy is to target ubiquitin pathway enzymes acting at non-proteasomal sites—E1, E2, and E3, associated with ubiquitin conjugation, and deubiquitylating enzymes (“DUBs”)—that act locally on selected targets rather than on the whole cell. Inhibitors (or activators, in some cases) of these enzymes should be developable as selective antitumor agents with toxicity profiles superior to that of bortezomib. Various therapeutic hypotheses follow from known cellular mechanisms of these target enzymes; most hypotheses relate to cancer, reminiscent of the FDA-approved protein kinase inhibitors now marketed. Since ubiquitin tagging controls the cellular content, activity, or compartmentation of proteins associated with disease, inhibitors or activators of ubiquitin conjugation or deconjugation are predicted to have an impact on disease. For practical and empirical reasons, inhibitors of ubiquitin pathway enzymes have been the favored therapeutic avenue. In approximately the time that has elapsed since the approval of bortezomib in 2003, there has been some progress in developing potential anticancer drugs that target various ubiquitin pathway enzymes. An E1 inhibitor and inhibitors of E3 are now in clinical trial, with some objective responses reported. Appropriate assays and/or rational design may uncover improved inhibitors of these enzymes, as well as E2 and DUBs, for further development.

This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl(-/-) mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl(+/+) mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctsl(+/+) mice, although Ctsl(+/+) mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl(-/-) mice had profound deficits in CD4+ lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/029cbbc9d293cf84314c912a56035b27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03b8b16d9dc9067e0509dd7e31961c40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a67d63c118e7585e16d28d257f64dc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d9c629fcfa25adb13ee3e2625b22590, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c8e29e3f013d9decc1bdf6128983af6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fe3fe414693ff6407df51d0a8153db8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/216ad76dc5eceef0534b148cf7675339, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2171c0b3ec8e6414f370076856893080, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23f841bddc5732ee33147a2e03c13297, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f79e9f9a324249419e44be16d2e4bd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3898db14f0e28e9c7b0412282650e52c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39a518e3c1abb1d105198cb95d688d29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c5ae039f91b8444e3f86c0bb5471e19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c6ca23acd0cf01cdc86701ff454136a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e14587478ecdb8b40cd1867d25de2ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54b6986f95f12f56b6f937871d1d62d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5817f0ddc1d7d7665b2ee850b91c3f77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5db6fa6e8569d18e265d7c9018d4d2ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61cd61b434b77ff55e165b36b9d081c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6758412d93f6440620adb3c6c6e54fc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7789b6dbee5fe017c5289346e425b8a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78597376e148026f2a9a12cca5dded0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80fc3cfc8f287a4ab1bbc9c204b7a787, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/828890c2ae28dbab7367a481e0e6ba87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88690862310b19ba0acb36c69c18e953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96acd52cc90a672d93f8b1e24a30c408, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a22fe51ef4f6b0a088e4423312a73b1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a38f32e9c51ab7b805afabf0607c514d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3dc94beb8e8f78579caf3963f95df42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3f70957365e29f0f1149f81dbdc9641, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4facb684b72eedcf6ae1f61821470ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a685889e8193d095d121d70c0bd337d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b15a2af7bb5f49ca5fd6419dca14c2d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b241d5d6c68417eb9226827019f4fbd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b28af3526cacb58a485390d616a9e8d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4814be04c537199c9dda97f11db91ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5deb3500f82e8a8a6f757ea1fb5f6ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b86208c97d3f345248f56a2bfadb51cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c21c0f0ffac7a0dac51db0f833ceae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bce2e41bfea97f36ea4f9c2b3df664a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0f2475ce8b9da4f59afa7c4d039c838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2e94cf21d31a3c2b28a50ec03bf3234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c69f7938553370b81067cc9ccda982c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e25f0763c12d2387133a4ab3c3f382dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b6b06cc72f29b22867bd387b62037e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3c2221b67ea4b490eb5b2c44256f1ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5a146df95363d548fac057b1a98fa46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f732f57d61544a7d3522ed3502d95cc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa5ea7d98596b46a8ec985728b4f5f5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb2ec7ea8eb5e9f937def99624345690, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb9977b9fa18153e807aa86aa3582add"

Little is known about the biology and pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus that causes SARS. The tissue and cellular distributions of coronaviral hypothetical and structural proteins in SARS were investigated. Antibodies against the hypothetical (SARS 3a, 3b, 6, 7a and 9b) and structural proteins (envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike) of the coronavirus were generated from predicted antigenic epitopes of each protein. The presence of these proteins were first verified in coronavirus-infected Vero E6 tissue culture model. Immunohistochemical studies on different human tissues, including a cohort of nine autopsies, two liver biopsies and intestinal biopsies of SARS patients, further confirmed the existence of coronaviral hypothetical and structural proteins in the cytoplasm of pneumocytes and small intestinal surface enterocytes in SARS patients. With this vast array of antibodies, no signal was observed in other cell types including those organs in which reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were reported to be positive. Structural proteins and the functionally undefined hypothetical proteins were expressed in coronavirus-infected cells with distinct expression pattern in different organs in SARS patients. These antipeptide antibodies can be useful for the diagnosis of SARS at the tissue level.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08f9b9857bc354d295828f80347642ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10cce7cc59e70f3291bfb6aad0b7ad16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b3b62331304ddc682641df9e14799c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/232520702acb7da87fdbbabc02e0cc29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f1776f82af8add1261bcd3efdfbbfb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3107e2fc6647e32a3885bbd5e68689f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37083ae8f784e38f27e9df4769fe0c94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/382fdae65408e719a4976470b3e95ba6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46b64f6cdac4fbf27378e10887def1cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b8d4e2543e0f67f40f8ecca62bf9734, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5790ca8feb02f57e0660c0eee2c8f307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b06b6e57d3cb852ae2816000c998bbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63bd8e4a08b1914d43d63b67c7b3b655, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67e9c87b8ee7e468dfd56c5d84565783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75bd897ea087d3028b838cbec649dd77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/841724e9fd25f9b3c4fe8ec6d1ff5945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/927ed2f79ced90aaaca86bf326237986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b60e896710a37d532aabeb008e1062b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c4d9b9c6227198224f8ab710f49d110, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d401c9bf4da9be1411209b176269f5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ee5ab96cc013c95055415c12a7f5de1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8af7944bed96d8c589850d70721cd45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bac9226a62026f7dae70ad59a9067661, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bafbef6d5b18e7e1a947ff4f32764644, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0a671fbacfaddda9eb32411f3001bda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6c76c27b423b5615c2ddbfd7d7f8527, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da25d3566225ea4ecc65c40342a3c996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd2c272a202055c45c7adfa4a566cbe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e14f429f4881c130b049f408413d85eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1bf6c12fbe4e5540cbbaebe3e3c0c66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e64779d4cfa5ba948ad3e71e27f9faed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e833854cc2224d1921e2f1770ae9515d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eaa4e9576334701c4a42f028e0ce709a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f51f4077c77c435c90ae3bbfd4310c15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f626ed84db29ccd0b3bf223d8492f436, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe4a881726cf694ae7d8097cfa4767ce"

Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/009407b6e27ac467970685c8b8ddd711, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/081406678740e5aae2d18b15c4bc5146, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17dd9c1d4a142259d4d4fd9c1b56daf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26c5b049554730c875d23961fdf38d7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3600c172bd55eae4951739fcfa5d6918, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44919a37001a059519f6e62b364c4094, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e1270a9fda316d14e600f9fbe4ba001, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f1594744a33f87362ba9136b889d2db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8572134c88ae7ab1253b122451cd354c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b2c755c34aeb4e5ece86a19fbb75d7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bac760bb41f5e48327643e1aa1dd84c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdcbc86c9b005a7238d5f735206d2323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6e6b2c5d87909fe4b261b8f9a49f0f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0799d6fd615e4388d416c30d5603199, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d80ba811246f84d4a7b01069d18ab134"

By using this system, the duration of a primary transcription initiation activity which transcribes subgenomic-size RNAs from the genomic-size RNA template in MHV-infected cells was examined. Efficient DI genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis was observed when the DI RNA was transfected at 1, 3, 3.5, 5, and 6 h postinfection, indicating that all activities which are necessary for MHV RNA synthesis are present continuously during the first 6 h of infection. The effect of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis on DI genomic RNA replication was then examined. Replication efficiency of the DI genomic RNA which synthesized the subgenomic RNA was approximately 70% lower than that of DI genomic RNA which did not synthesize the subgenomic DI RNA in MHV-infected cells. Cotransfection of two different-size DI RNAs demonstrated that replication of the larger DI RNA was strongly inhibited by replication of the smaller genomic DI RNA. Cotransfection of two DI RNA species of the same length into MHV-infected cells demonstrated that reduced replication of the genomic DI RNA which synthesizes the subgenomic RNA did not affect the replication of cotransfected DI RNA, demonstrating that the reduction in DI genomic RNA replication works only in cis, not in trans. Therefore, the previously proposed hypothesis that coronavirus, subgenomic RNA synthesis may inhibit the replication of genomic RNA by competing for a limited amount of virus-derived factors seems unlikely. Possible mechanisms of coronavirus transcription are discussed.",""

PCR products were detected by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The P-10, P-15 and P-24 regions of the gag gene of FIV were chosen as the target sequences for amplification, and three primer pairs were prepared. The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA. FIV proviral DNA was detected by the PCR method with either primer pair (one-step amplification: single PCR) in DNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 of 12 FIV antibody-positive cats. When PCR products in each of the 12 cats were subjected to a second amplification using the same primer pair (two-step amplification: double PCR), FIV proviral DNA was detected in all of the cats. When PBL samples collected from three cats that were negative and three that were positive in the single PCR were cultured for a few weeks in the presence of interleukin 2, FIV proviral DNA was detected in all six cats by the single PCR method. The results suggest that either the use of cultured PBL as the sample or the performance of the double PCR method enables simple and specific detection of FIV proviral DNA in PBL.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26b63ae72e167078809a0f0106d851ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54986d933cd1b6e99a6e68a241a74047, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7de12842960e1184ec970beb7ac5cdc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84df46a01a786f0b8fbaa20dd3932dac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e601369e0584ba99f4be068109ab137"

The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction (∼60– 80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion.

Coronaviruses were detected in 141 samples (15.3%) from species of ducks, shorebirds and herons and from multiple sampling locations. Sequencing of selected positive samples found mainly gammacoronaviruses, but also some deltacoronaviruses. The detection rate of coronaviruses was improved by using multiple PCR assays, as no single assay could detect all coronavirus positive samples. Sequencing of the relatively conserved Orf1 PCR amplicons found that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses were similar to duck gammacoronaviruses around the world. Some sequenced shorebird gammacoronaviruses belonged to Charadriiformes lineages, but others were more closely related to duck gammacoronaviruses. Australian duck and heron deltacoronaviruses belonged to lineages with other duck and heron deltacoronaviruses, but were almost 20% different in nucleotide sequence to other deltacoronavirus sequences available. Deltacoronavirus sequences from shorebirds formed a lineage with a deltacoronavirus from a ruddy turnstone detected in the United States. Given that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other regions, and Australian ducks rarely come into contact with migratory Palearctic duck species, we hypothesise that migratory shorebirds are the important vector for moving wild bird coronaviruses into and out of Australia.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00d98b2ffd8d783e8319eb530c199ddf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/093f28b4a1fb9a38f662c15b74f762a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10740cd19387c7276370f591a55f072d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e4d4914bfdb8567605d2a334355c86d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2eca9d66d8bcdb624f186ce8edfd75f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4053859004585159ccc917b86c0252eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41b51bb14320b683408d81ee5be16307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45848f9afb02b98c585fea74ce873a91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bad03824bea0157a1b88d0b560ffba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80e957895afd314e95195edb6d709cd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9241d40a5a9369ce138d2b73b1c07324, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c61c6a077d4babb37689d3a4a45c853, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ccfa1c61bbc822aefc4082c236dd2b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ce832dc14bc66381b4b789c27a8d745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2a9239ab0619f783c074ee05234c1e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b731ca96aa7a18dc10aa595c4f7251a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba9baf8ec481ab6c77a0adb5e5fd9eee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bad4845ed685496813390c9732f132d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1e3633cb0d76ea359d520342b889081, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d10c4e03d1d3fb6edbb1f548dc86e729, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9b9f6b8fd9599a4bf3d19cd579edc80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7d41cfaa345712618ce806a70030262, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eeaec4bbfa060d7e270235ef59b3b569, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f02e99f7258662044c6f70407c2e99e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1b2bb8456318de28414399a08b7ad55"

Our hypothesis was that body weight would increase or plateau, whereas body condition and behavioral scores would decrease, as disease progressed. Results indicated that body weight did not differ significantly between the control and experimental groups, but the experimental group experienced significant decreases in both body condition and behavioral scores.

Damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are normal intracellular components or metabolites that, when released from cells, signal cellular damage/lysis. Purine metabolite DAMPs, including extracellular ATP and adenosine, inhibit chlamydial development in a species-specific manner. Viral co-infection has been shown to reversibly abrogate Chlamydia inclusion development, suggesting persistence/chlamydial stress. Because viral infection can cause host cell DAMP release, we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial development. Therefore, we examined the effect of extracellular ATP, adenosine, and cyclic AMP exposure, at 0 and 14 hours post infection, on C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serovar E development. In the absence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post or at 14 hours post infection reduced inclusion size; however, the effect was less robust upon 14 hours post infection exposure. Additionally, upon exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent infectivity were reduced in both Chlamydia species. These effects were reversible, and C. pecorum exhibited more pronounced recovery from DAMP exposure. Aberrant bodies, typical in virus-induced chlamydial persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. In the presence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection reduced inclusion size, but only variably modulated chlamydial infectivity. Because chlamydial infection and other infections may increase local DAMP concentrations, DAMPs may influence Chlamydia infection in vivo, particularly in the context of poly-microbial infections.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/027be214a5ee76468a185b0be337a2d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02b73c7f2769b3a038d3f6d6cda85392, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05211e990d9dd102aff5e59edcd5cb7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05af6635ec4fd099922fb9a3060685e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0743161ec6bc9e981b321b51335adc76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e7c43e3f0ae51e1cf5ee97c374dadb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12e007e7352cb3341107118ecbf1132e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/153c765645124490557b1d30c76c4c71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1baabc450d46b842dbac9e99c584a9e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c95488d8ae059037951e0b161f5a067, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f643b35e20f1fd7b9262a34980edba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22846936ec18dc87f3035d7df3a4c848, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/246c86e368d909727ea37434d1818736, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cfc7c46637fd6418a825644f4b24b4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31e830351913c7bb41ef7ed0fce80c97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35c979fa72a4181b638bdbc038c27cda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37c24f678c8a9c5308a7f60515936632, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3981ea9f8ddadcd49993611f5c4eaa8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39a7f33513414b0b7e4fbd037207c28a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40e8d0160cfe321108198f27af288937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4321f8413a4f339d0b46a1d2519d7c04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46b8021057dfe61a2a3283da9e36bbef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ac55dc471905fc828667a38731dd047, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/591952fa1f9baa785de258c04b6d67a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/652f7b5494e5dbed47f53fdaf279febb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/654e1da002b7cc107b0b3b413a466f2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69a2fed25d980a04fcc2d9b13f9b090a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f8f308e12308aa96d3d6dc7a18a42ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70902ad83e62da79c4011287ae10e28e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/712d36c8242c5446b23a95036b08ccf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7580fc2aab4048028a5790e6aab0b52c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80c9228aa11926685e3d59e925fae450, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8187b56aeaccf1272f7128e7886f8560, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/872c87383a17fc5f3c60116f731a33ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/902239ff7344fbcdc908a74b322ea5b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91eb6d3853b47934ea19f8baed8506dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94cd639dd5022883d59a5200e0648ec7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99e7d26f1a375f44bb15687cfd4b911d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9efd9cb7de61ea68b00debe671991a82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac1810b65baa257f6bf21ef4e19b3e34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b24309abb50288c6e2d50da2cd89855e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b44f1b2f2d962820c9548659440ec0ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b69959e286fb5da0b8b6b77844dbe599, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c67c9c56f856c37f0940eb1d0911e687, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d07cdfe7a6067faf30f157d0bf6fee3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2e94d30d98672bf979a4d7110644736, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d60063d7ffef24564e4e56c7c4c1ce86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb189289a648b9ad0c3592005fc0fa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb904ba80e16bdb92802a01d49198399, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4a9c98b7affae52d2835271b2670527, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9d9445f04c0cbe18d557ffabd4306b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb66c51c19f12cd0fa7328ebcb396f04"

This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of three widely-used measures of conspiracist beliefs in Iran. We translated the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI), Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), and Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale (GCBS) into Persian. Factorial validity was examined using principal-axis factor analysis in a community sample from Tehran, Iran (N = 544). Further, the relationships between scores on these measures and hypothesized antecedents (i.e., education, schizotypal personality, information processing style, superstitious beliefs, religiosity, and political orientation) were examined. Overall, we failed to find support for the parent factor structures of two of the three scales (BCTI and GCBS) and evidence of construct validity for all three scales was limited. These results highlight the necessity of further psychometric work on existing measures of conspiracy theories in diverse culturo-linguistic groups and the development of context-specific measures of conspiracist beliefs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18fb6ca184841d82c6091d5605101696, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c82bd041ebae1637e50b150c15eec0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/235c79bb7704a342b2afbd8484343dc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24387262a6e71e1fd9a0cacf6465d5da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fe4b9b3a8e06a3bd349bbf02a691a57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/313da4d8601595ea48072b55f10f1113, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/332ebcff2a24f7d9fdf4aeca04d41fac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35d36e5da900908398460c7cc7fabc81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d5c03f0b3ec68b41ce9d158b53e5d7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42851ddd117a9a673264c5a6bf2f5812, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fa25fd5218ab6bee467864ed7c7f3bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50c10195d58c1c0c1edba3f978a5ed49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a00aa0e41d2ca0586eecaa9de3f539f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a2329a4eb3965a21a0b81cc9a29499e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cbc75b618af15412c949c6c5977cbec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71c89d7d6bba46ccef95f20c59c46043, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7252b711044d74a4d0abe4e374f7b5be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/776ab3b3cfd02df73fc784c5258b0ff6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dad6f42aea13eae62faab7a009becf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/806cab3e05fb063e07144dee86f9a784, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83106b79438814e156df7e37aa48c74f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85593f64992d0c8ce9f18628b0047080, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8632d7ffe9efa59b525882cceb51238c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a844e773fe130f8b00213b26eebc9d1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b040d5159ec2101093f96abd1877630e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1d60eae5cdbbd68a8c3c12a525909c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3decb8501e614740fcd4ec9d6a901d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c20e1c4bf37c7b5cc491f18cc83e9f33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca72d5129392b48e840f8b92be6f90ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce41fbb1a9c5e3dd157cd355b2c8389f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2cd283bc5bf56a6330a06b50274869c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e651d4715958b45fd943e5b3bde4f837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed7769e7d17412fe3004f2f96c24d587"

However, enhancements made to EDNA increased its capacity to conduct hypothesis directed detection of specific gene targets present in transcriptomic databases. To target specific pathogenicity factors used by the pathogen to infect its host or other targets of interest, e-probes need to be developed for transcripts related to that function. In this study, EDNA transcriptomics (EDNAtran) was developed to detect the expression of genes related to aflatoxin production at the transcriptomic level. E-probes were designed from genes up-regulated during A. flavus aflatoxin production. EDNAtran detected gene transcripts related to aflatoxin production in a transcriptomic database from corn, where aflatoxin was produced. The results were significantly different from e-probes being used in the transcriptomic database where aflatoxin was not produced (atoxigenic AF36 strain and toxigenic AF70 in Potato Dextrose Broth).","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dddec03a3a75d9e04be05a318cabf83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f5fdc49815d7189d35f078df3ec1688, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f72323ad93e5587cdab53cdf5588e09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/211d5c39ddddcbd81af9be4fbb4efe42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2125edb7b5ea0ccb8a178f3b6d9ad683, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28aadfd341a56f0011758c6b79a78a3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a08832f0c29654446ed00e0736a3425, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a334b75f2590df0741a96d33c97835f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d4845d8475ad1784948ee518964f627, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36e8361abeed6c5f55279f392700f525, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c0fe45d1d71b8f0cd924f9474ce599e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45059d38a9dcc38e9b560d90436df305, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48548746212c3689d971b054fb4f4c2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e6637378d409d001f142788c191715b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5138d9b3a76ff8c152e586dd643fe64c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/547469cbe2941e5a86cf6ed4324eff70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/651e3b61714b7755f466707d2d6d86eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ebeb62e6b02a6b14d94b2e31fc779b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c6659b1e71a660b6d1e3d250c8a7d36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82065b93e0c13f1704a4ca08d6d3ed14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/868f8b4fdf3e03985b915d704834c444, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cc36d2cca1fc11cd6ecd20c8c5b5016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d74a26b6896c6dba6baa6bcf4d08c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95c4ede01fad801bd7063ab93c7faf93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c87e8032ae5fa60af119a4917e3d46c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ea6c2c66f60c3aed0a9ed52764cf1ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aaa4647b3b4e8232efbfc5aea28d36dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0d0d37348121ce519ba63c977f25f5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbf101179e85ae4212404f943167088b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd238f7fb8fc96de70c4bcb54c1962d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf7163409c5a6e329984ef53ff4577c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5605b74b015f1682893d33d8b1a2aeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e390dd15e19148f640cd001834b37f2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e43bc9d84c2922fc79f48f2d6bdf7732, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f762f531f9deff8b02b5f9083dc3643e"

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.",""

The screen revealed a high-score interaction with cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle early G(1) phase. M2-cyclin D3 interaction was validated through GST pull-down and recapitulated in influenza A/WSN/33-infected cells. Knockdown of Ccnd3 by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced virus progeny titers in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, the increase in virus production was due to cyclin D3 deficiency per se and not merely a consequence of cell cycle deregulation. A combined knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1, which rescued cell cycle progression into S phase, failed to normalize virus production. Infection by influenza A virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2 with M1, which is essential for proper assembly of progeny virions, lending further support to its role as a putative restriction factor. Our study describes the identification and characterization of cyclin D3 as a novel interactor of influenza A virus M2 protein. We hypothesize that competitive inhibition of M1-M2 interaction by cyclin D3 impairs infectious virion formation and results in attenuated virus production. In addition, we provide mechanistic insights into the dynamic interplay of influenza virus with the host cell cycle machinery during infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b0f3170b75708f868c9522f08fc5016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37606ef5c1d3e391a44cf36e7c06ed66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79cff91585fac596fc5e3bd4a6d43534, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/818e97669274c091843f43e111513f5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99816212abdfa8ff9bc10808b788d1f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa1a571a1b212a1fb313348ee2c99fc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbb62ba45230e3c62f282b53876f7646, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4a9f54c32dc2f07b3ec67817daabc80"

Predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including the impact of HRV species and types are poorly understood. Objectives This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV infections among HM patients. Study design From April 2012–March 2013, HRV-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic HM patients were molecularly characterized by analysis of partial viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 gene sequence. HRV LRTI risk-factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results One hundred and ten HM patients presented with HRV URTI (n =78) and HRV LRTI (n =32). Hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0–9.2; p =0.05) was independently associated with LRTI, but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients with URTI versus LRTI. Detection of bacterial co-pathogens was common in LRTI cases (25%). Among 92 typeable respiratory specimens, there were 58 (64%) HRV-As, 12 (13%) HRV-Bs, and 21 (23%) HRV-Cs, and one Enterovirus 68. LRTI rates among HRV-A (29%), HRV-B (17%), and HRV-C (29%) were similar. HRV-A infections occurred year-round while HRV-B and HRV-C infections clustered in the late fall and winter. Conclusions HRVs are associated with LRTI in HM patients. Illness severity is not attributable to specific HRV species or types. The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/069c1c04265db5843395f0bc7f1321de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f834fc6815dbd2c519813625c26c3ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10a3fde26b8a1e4eaaec94446945756f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c6f9e40ca5fd094e2264fab99f547d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a09d8970f6a41d697126c5b7e208b3ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4616b14fbbda28a02f1ec0aff49c9c8"

First, the NOS activity in haemocytes of shrimps was determined by the means of NBT reduction and changes in cell conformation. And the variations of NOS activity in shrimps after challenge with WSSV intramuscularly were evaluated through the analysis of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate (both as NO derivates) concentrations. The result showed that NOS activity in the haemocytes of F. chinensis increased slightly from 0 to 12h postchallenge, indicated by the variations of l-citrulline (from 11.15±0.10 to 12.08±0.64μM) and total nitrite/nitrate concentrations (from 10.45±0.65 to 12.67±0.52μM). Then it decreased sharply till the end of the experiment (84h postchallenge), the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 84h were 1.58±0.24 and 2.69±0.70μM, respectively. The LPS-stimulated NOS activity kept constant during the experiment. However, in M. japonicus, the NOS activity kept increasing during the first 72h postchallenge, the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate increased from 7.82±0.77 at 0h to 10.79±0.50μM at 72h, and from 8.98±0.43 at 0h to 11.20±0.37μM at 72h, respectively. Then it decreased till the end of the experiment (216h postchallenge), and the concentrations of l-citrulline and total nitrite/nitrate at 216h were 5.66±0.27 and 4.68±0.16μM, respectively. More importantly, an apparent increase of LPS-stimulated NOS activity was observed in M. japonicus at 48h postchallenge, which was about 4 times higher than that in the control group of health shrimps. In correspondence with the difference of NOS activity between the two species of shrimps, the cumulative mortalities of the shrimps were also different. All shrimps of F. chinensis in the mortality experiment died in 66h, much more quickly than M. japonicus, whose accumulative mortality reached 100% after 240h. Data here reported let us hypothesize that NOS activity in the haemocytes of shrimps F. chinensis and M. japonicus responses to WSSV infection differently, and this might be one of the reasons for the different susceptibility of F. chinensis and M. japonicus to WSSV infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b4c7d397b1cbed7f54baead659a30d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d090ff9cfc8f02bd1752374b1633395, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1167d3192eed934027ee98040acf956d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/226d371eb44b60f091ec4698d93f07eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a41960c22f32f2901522bc2da643064, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/302fd6cc2d307e889bda1840335c79b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b969fa61463c84dc0fd9b380975d488, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c881a13c9588fc8737cb570bad220d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ee88452b3590cbb669931c49651224d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6530ec2c4e8d568d0c86408358234eda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/681cdf5200e5f382bfc1f7122c0003d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f7a4b20480d3a981bd16be2eef17af5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7208575e86d8ff87299fd4010b114a6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c06a0b94daa56f4641787f7a6ce9a41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80a3866ac247d49d44f2e1f515675cdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81771c1c6509ae74a579fd8ad8e51e14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82f2a007518a78374555dc70437cc9ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fca1b8531ee9ecdb3e1d2d0b30d9017, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9173a6da6420132e893bc079f4351db2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92857def5d95bea3d272e930c194c49b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94ddea6a82ffa606a628a89a8def6214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98a87031359ffcdaa9fbc7f7012b50db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98b75478d999e994c4ead865bad79e47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9952203b2750e28138c022913d5f2daa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a47d4cb5b3af8cdd4d5027a818a792fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8a999ba15ec3662eb6d8c7a0befc0e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae9b40ccc86e41f5f5f691afe322c1bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b383f1f2e1ac66b84ba08afac2b7c74f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc1f5dea805729e503012e7ea4d50177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc706df27fd5ca4f973a113f632d8337, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be7524be6f9ad10f5345fc825879ae2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c50ebfe03d0eadac4fa80534bc572435, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca48046e80b7ee7f277f1da6d9c35afd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5cb8dc60a3ab23bab29cbe33da9ef80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d667169a7584bc6e3de8a649c30ed28b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d680eaa2a3f93382240399fe6e531543, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6bd417096a2ecc150511cac9f9b6814, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc5720632e57183f848c6372f2873b6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9c30c6591e22f321acd868ee117098d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec4f6691006d9e3a965d6548726f4b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed5354a0d79b50502d5b53f454b01b5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/effec72d03b2cc0036fdf055448edf36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2ad952dce79699c1d583a5371c19846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f48043aaa18838662dd91c72689414da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f84b3abea1c09cd23870695ff0849c0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fab11f1ed901de8990b9512b5709a382"

Estimates of risk reductions and associated operational costs of both HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation are modeled and compared using a case study of airborne transmission of influenza in a hypothetical office space. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent levels of outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13–16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7–11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b62bcba0700d4fa0d6800fbe3a7954d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5df360545ae807f976ac3eac2863f9ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fba11b0057abf4e2e1cfed0a8aceed2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6508594be4f67556172c9882f358aaec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/694c32febd3a13f58af2d16709c0140c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70fd7e3d878b02f2882eedc1000b6dec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82324d611c9104cf843e8b533ad90727, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88cb240d4f7734d74842bac069e065fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91348e1987b272f2b88abf626b47e3bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a62027e5157b8d7455c33780d4d780c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae0036d05f486f1472fa3d1c9e4001ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae6a0134eddd95b89e9e5df6ed5f78f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b00642f9a849d49cec02c9c6047a7005, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5101bfd37d63fe12fd0f76ae3c53980, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c70572b6e3e436dfb24e15912678f083, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c773e7914ebcb200fea01cdfd6f5ce83"

To explain this phenomenon, 2 hypotheses were formulated: 1) the presence of a 2nd pathogen could be exacerbating the porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) infection, or 2) a new and more virulent PCV-2 strain could be infecting swine. In 2005, 13 PMWS cases were submitted to the Quebec provincial diagnostic laboratory and PCV-2 was the only virus that could be found consistently by PCR in all 13 samples. The PCR detection results obtained for other viruses revealed the following: 61.5% were positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 30.8% for swine influenza virus, 15.4% for porcine parvovirus, 69.2% for swine torque teno virus (swTTV), 38.5% for swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) and 84.6% for Mycoplasma hyorhinis; transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus (TGEV/PRCV) was not detected. Sequences of the entire genome revealed that these PCV-2 strains belonged to a genotype (named PCV-2b) that has never been reported in Canada. Further sequence analyses on 83 other Canadian PCV-2 positive cases submitted to the provincial diagnostic laboratory during years 2005 and 2006 showed that 79.5% of the viral sequences obtained clustered in the PCV-2b genotype. The appearance of the PCV-2b genotype in Canada may explain the death rate increase related to PMWS, but this relationship has to be confirmed.",""

During the early stages of the HP-PRRSV infection, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines are noted in the host peripheral blood, which are accompanied by severe lesions in the lungs and immune system organs; these are considered as the greatest contributors to the overall disease burden. We hypothesized that the anti-PRRSV response in piglets might be mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which led to a decrease in the psycho-neuroendocrinological manifestation of HP-PRRSV etiology via immune response regulation. RESULTS: We investigated the regulation of the HPA axis in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets that were treated with 1 mg/kg body weight (b. w.)/day mifepristone (RU486) or 2 mg/kg b.w./day dexamethasone (DEX). Both RU486 and DEX enhanced the disease status of the piglets infected by the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain, resulting in high mortality and more severe pathological changes in the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: HP-PRRSV infection activates the HPA axis, and artificial regulation of the immune-endocrine system enhances disease severity in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets. Thus, DEX and RU486 should be avoided in the clinical treatment of HP-PRRS.

Mutations in surfactant protein C (SP-C) induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in AECs and cause lung fibrosis. This study tested the hypothesis that ER stress-induced apoptosis of AECs might also be regulated by the autocrine ANGII/ANG1–7 system of AECs. ER stress was induced in A549 cells or primary cultures of human AECs with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S. ER stress activated the ANGII-generating enzyme cathepsin D and simultaneously decreased the ANGII-degrading enzyme ACE-2, which normally generates the antiapoptotic peptide ANG1–7. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of ADAM17/TACE, significantly reduced both the activation of cathepsin D and the loss of ACE-2. Apoptosis of AECs induced by ER stress was measured by assays of mitochondrial function, JNK activation, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptosis induced by either MG132 or the SP-C BRICHOS mutant G100S was significantly inhibited by the ANG receptor blocker saralasin and was completely abrogated by ANG1–7. Inhibition by ANG1–7 was blocked by the specific mas antagonist A779. These data show that ER stress-induced apoptosis is mediated by the autocrine ANGII/ANG1–7 system in human AECs and demonstrate effective blockade of SP-C mutation-induced apoptosis by ANG1–7. They also suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at administering ANG1–7 or stimulating ACE-2 may hold potential for the management of ER stress-induced fibrotic lung disorders.",""

Within 24 h of hospital admission, a total of 922 patients aged ≥60 years were interviewed for symptoms of ongoing respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic patients were swabbed for oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal presence of viral pathogens immediately by members of the study group. During a 2-month period, non-symptomatic volunteers among interviewed patients were swabbed as well (controls). Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with real-time PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. A total of 147 out of 173 symptomatic patients and 56 non-symptomatic patients (controls) agreed to participate in the study. The patients were allocated to three cohorts: (1) symptomatic and PCR-positive (S/PCR+), (2) symptomatic and PCR-negative (S/PCR−), or (3) non-symptomatic and PCR-negative (control). There were no non-symptomatic patients with a positive PCR result. A non-significant difference in the frequency of empiric antibiotic administration was found when comparing the S/PCR+ to the S/PCR− cohort; 16/19 (84 %) vs. 99/128 (77 %) (χ(2) = 0.49). Antibiotic treatment was withdrawn in only two patients in the S/PCR+ cohort after receiving a positive viral diagnosis. The length of stay did not significantly differ between the S/PCR+ and the S/PCR− groups. We conclude that, at least in our general hospital setting, access to early viral diagnosis by real-time PCR had little impact on the antimicrobial treatment or length of hospitalization of elderly patients.

These interactions occur within a larger protein complex or within a given nano-environment. To illustrate this complexity empirically, we developed a protocol to analyze FRET among more than two fluorescent proteins (multi-FRET). In multi-FRET, we model FRET among more than two fluorophores as the sum of all possible pairwise interactions within the complex. We validated our assumption by demonstrating that FRET among pairs within a fluorescent triplet resembled FRET between each pair measured in the absence of the third fluorophore. FRET between two receptor chains increases with increasing FRET between the ligand-binding chain (e.g., IFN-γR1, IL-10R1 and IFN-λR1) and an acylated fluorescent protein that preferentially resides within subsections of the plasma membrane. The interaction of IL-10R2 with IFN-λR1 or IL-10R1 results in decreased FRET between IL-10R2 and the acylated fluorescent protein. Finally, we analyzed FRET among four fluorescent proteins to demonstrate that as FRET between IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 or between IFN-αR1 and IFN-αR2c increases, FRET among other pairs of proteins changes within each complex.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10ce192d2c3587b10bd4090744dd2206, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/142bf1ecac7527fa64c0ce08376f0642, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c6e1eeb22acba03c8967ddc6868fe2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d86d82262ac74c264174f591a3b9ad4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/302a0d62f47d909b4ea5a22507104fa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/350191adf976f50ab07656d5687e1cbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/587f027bede4eaa799b68ede121312ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58db7f2256983224f0d2ec5a00f13d96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59f4472b758368375b0fb270f0b4516d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e4018a867a81e380ebf3c484459c88d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f76f4b03228f69e694ef66e61e37839, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/740b1a3191d7a5d79c258d84aecc8e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d96e33907d7c41df0ebfd83783eb753, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/870e59cb635580c415226d7508cfeb9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/871e6590cd4baf9ad091600e7c2ff260, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b6d98c82192e8ce78d8a037f92f2cf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a999f2b422e62f55becf22fa05d170f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae8eaebb90e17be0ba3f7d61c2da1df5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c387dc7e833e833bd1d83dc603acf1bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db201b22f1d78b5728d59aebc890bb8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df4a36785b5a896723aabae3cad40420, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e35064187009c7815daf09cfb10f913d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8cb223781df0ac4c008665d6ac0d999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef0308339e0abd8130b6ea20606c50c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f23d0a1af1b288711fbea507e3bc9a5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f65ffb781d895f7c51c461bb9d35d993, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb99c93a382ebeb6756da074128ac369"

Altered zinc turnover may be also involved in depressed TTA efficiency. Zinc turnover is under the control of zinc-bound metallothioneins (Zn-MTs) synthesis. Thyroid hormones, corticosterone and nutritional zinc affect Zn-MT induction. Zn-MT releases zinc in young-adult age during transient oxidative stress for prompt immune response. In constant oxidative stress (ageing and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy), high liver Zn-MTs, low zinc ion bioavailability and depressed TTA efficiency appear. This last finding suggested that MT might not release zinc during constant oxidative stress leading to impaired TTA efficiency. The aim of this work/study is to clarify the role of Zn-MTs (I+II) in TTA efficiency during development and ageing. The main results are (1) Old and PTU mice display high corticosterone, enhanced liver MTmRNA, low zinc and depressed TTA efficiency restored by zinc supply. Increased survival and no significant increments in basal liver Zn-MTs proteins occur in old and PTU mice after zinc supply. (2) Lot of zinc ions bound with MT in the liver from old mice than young (HPLC). (3) Young-adult Tx mice, evaluated at 15 days from thymectomy, display high MTmRNA and nutritional–endocrine–immune damage restored by zinc supply or by thymus grafts from old zinc-treated mice. (4) Young-adult Tx mice, but evaluated at 40 days from thymectomy, display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and nutritional–endocrine–immune profile with survival similar to normal mice. (5) Stressed (constant dark for 10 days) mice overexpressing MT display low zinc, depressed immunity, reduced thymic cortex, high corticosterone, altered thyroid hormones turnover showing a likeness with old mice. These findings, taken altogether, show that corticosterone is pivotal in MTs induction under stress. MTs bind preferentially zinc ions in constant oxidative stress, but with no release of zinc from MT leading to impaired TTA efficiency. Zinc supply restores the defect because zinc has no interference in affecting pre-existing Zn-MTs protein concentrations in old and PTU mice. Therefore, free zinc ions are available for TTA efficiency after zinc supply. Thymus from old zinc-treated mice induces the same restoring effect when transplanted in Tx recipients. However, Tx mice display natural normalisation in MTmRNA and in nutritional–endocrine–immune profile in the long run. Therefore, Zn-MTs (I+II) are crucial in zinc homeostasis for endocrine–immune efficiency during the entire life assuming a role of potential and novel ‘biological clock of ageing’.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0edb2fde4b5778f605bffdc1f5665478, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/116f612429132cb6717fe16b65b318b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1421d5bb3075bc477332b994b24e7a02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1be8fa323adca42db0e68d48d7eab1f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f1c572ed16b103848d66d7f5378599f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fcfca6c23197894d8b7c6a06c2931ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/229d6f54333998b969976f2e1a00e7d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/267f3f7e294799b3ddd7774a6194c13e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2778ed3fdb56a8ac11ae1faccbcf78ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/329009cf174baafe75d9e81b841a119a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33b58dfd6f35ede4dcc78522605c4ee5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ce5254b0c2da890e7374645bd41cfad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40d5949aa48c8cb45b4028b083ef72f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44cac691c077da9ca0e3473884833326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f613e250f01402790d19b194f30b6fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5257737d916e3ae6094f861813029914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a3ac60d77cbac10404b3c05a9c6389c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6002523241b8e21d16278e854bd83cd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/621247c707f7d013817dde910daf735b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/697aa7e750d5aec4133dfb975f42bf29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c9ffe0a0ab5b44660310490e2d84df8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d2ccf902b304803eb0fa2ef9156db64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e968d06c68fe8369d4bbd3c8f994d15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72a9a2e1be36d8e7be46649414843c77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/767acb4c8ba2e3cf0cf1e8387445af96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b129d04d2d852faf2234871680d7b72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b362b786d3c6bcb26c65d364e6455dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c103a439fdc1f1a9768cc51e2378d42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e230a128988fa834b10745c457f9ace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/806b776c63ac68410ce66430ac5670d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86dfabe2b1ba28ba8bdf6986ce24475b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a09fc5ab24430b28bfdac4b3b631b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bbeffdb87bd9d56e66a4146fecc405f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ddb8549b838d9e6ac5ed58ece03592a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f9ed2d9f39307c6931337143fd64149, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fbc32c2b7e3984d8bd845285528e9c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913d5b6665d26f5d326602ed8cb7e126, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/949dd17776389088c3d06daf805fa94e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97affde8192af9e7a0c5dbb1e3c85274, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fb8507cf8dd15c8e61dd1d4b660b432, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd7c0baad608af142f8a4f91103a0db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b01a4fc9c93872e22d23ab6b9b4a74ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b57f685947a058b62fb96b98afaaee23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6b48edd76c40cb9e201866117498bdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b95a5b8e67a6906682f979df93496bf7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9e77dc09922991485525c77cff6daab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcb0f68bbc3c1d96465f563b37d00e87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be5e0fd33daed0f184fb1f6b328fa3e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c634a452125176360d9b43529cc19a34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6de24effec0f67d520297ae098d7f49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccb0beef5eae665ac31044fcdbce5c08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d258f8f622efba9517f88ec8a639b768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3525e9d07ed0dd9c4ded8be31dcbded, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3ab7378986d35ca1f6b541c5ed8a8b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5aa359bb1acb97fc5196d2352013626, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da0a284bf50ec22be3c257dad91e5dab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db56ea200f4a4bc094da5e1e331369bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcee74b15ed7c12b48814abbfb8c5084, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21bdf9ca4ca71d6020e55de07051eae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eccde6cef00c38c693da4cdffd481a1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb5b14938bd8c4cf3c93ccdedff47a75"

Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.",""

Of the many candidate polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC genes contributing to disease susceptibility, including those encoding effector (cytokines and chemokines) or receptor molecules within the immune system (MHC, TCR, Ig or FcR), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes have the most significant influence. In this article we put forward the hypothesis that the influence of HLA genes on the risk to develop MS is actually the sum of multiple antigen presenting cell (APC) and T-cell interactions involving HLA class I and class II molecules.

Here, we evaluated whether the sequence similarity of various antigens to the microbiota dampens or increases immunogenicity of T cell epitopes. Sets of epitopes and control sequences derived from 38 antigenic categories (infectious pathogens, allergens, autoantigens) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Their similarity to microbiome sequences was calculated using the BLOSUM62 matrix. We found that sequence similarity was associated with either dampened (tolerogenic; e.g. most allergens) or increased (inflammatory; e.g. Dengue and West Nile viruses) likelihood of a peptide being immunogenic as a function of epitope source category. Ten-fold cross-validation and validation using sets of manually curated epitopes and non-epitopes derived from allergens were used to confirm these initial observations. Furthermore, the genus from which the microbiome homologous sequences were derived influenced whether a tolerogenic versus inflammatory modulatory effect was observed, with Fusobacterium most associated with inflammatory influences and Bacteroides most associated with tolerogenic influences. We validated these effects using PBMCs stimulated with various sets of microbiome peptides. “Tolerogenic” microbiome peptides elicited IL-10 production, “inflammatory” peptides elicited mixed IL-10/IFNγ production, while microbiome epitopes homologous to self were completely unreactive for both cytokines. We also tested the sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes to specific microbiome sequences derived from households of cockroach allergic individuals and non-allergic controls. Microbiomes from cockroach allergic households were less likely to contain sequences homologous to previously defined cockroach allergens. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes. Taken together this study suggests that microbiome sequence similarity influences immune reactivity to homologous epitopes encoded by pathogens, allergens and auto-antigens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f4b7ab5f06ee641618e460f4df2b568, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ace5a5e7f9011ab055030083f4ffd86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e10f58638e015ee4f2efab5bd5a0265, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6a828442cb541adb8eaa8ad7e803167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bde5bfc273b1652e60c5a192330c5e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2b27bd549035319e77122c9a720c1c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4d16bbe9363bb2d2e43eec0a2bbe947, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edd0f47e9b97654768b39e3e88f8300b"

The main proposition of this model is that information-sharing practices and context simultaneously shape each other. The proposed model supports Foster's conceptualization of information practices as non-linear processes, but its emphasis on the interdependence between context and information practices provides a more effective means to capture complex negotiations involved in information-sharing practices. The proposition is that the major reason for nonlinearity in information practices is a continuous shifting of actors' interests, pressures, and concerns. Capturing these dynamic relations becomes possible through this model. The model also offers a way to generate a number of research questions and hypotheses, and as such it could be a useful tool for empirical studies on information sharing in academic communities.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27a18434f70850a2791f525092a3095d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e5f76854e243346c034b13bda9cd77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54f7aa4b098f5758b4181151b9132111, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b7f26536fe83fdefd61084ef073798f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8123f55e58875a217bcb580a53b5451d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95f1a0c95cdc32bdbf0a18b3f09154f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/963a288f8c67817c326b5467c16fca9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aaabc504a9190de7b4d14c75cf4876e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad4f8b1e4edb5d2004a354fb5e9337a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc6974175746964d4fad7cebb521777c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c996593e4e5b6769c8ebf78ef8914672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f720398b8b425be10988b92a2efcc9ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf3044bb53249650c555ef5d416e170"

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bad7cd1987c79923cf34a87d8f65390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/233a365fecc3e21abe4fcea726a33825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31ec2dca1f5715ade59c300f69dedf1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/343b6ff837f8af40e42d774d21942cce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/518baf801ee08d547dc2985da92242bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e61b9781d5aaf9ed86ec147768dadf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ad787ff8dea96400ce474a5a2112361, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f3da472287d886cbe7445e1bc506582, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70e5e0004eda07c693747feaffaebad9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7922c9dcff9277918002dd0ffc1a104a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/797ca6b00c4b878c5b04b7ad806c5875, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92d3c6c8023ab303153da0817a81a8c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94645d9f0faf0c369f245a6f74c37835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aefb285e5afbb2f27510dcee77bf75ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9f6ae52c6c2401ce3c1946b9f6192ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c42af7282e4421d9df3807ae1702458f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c735052a11434be609a9cd45b90f1509, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6b35502e09fad208f26651107800945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e47c96f4b8dc2b844f040bc7ecc92970, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9a1a0e5468a1128fdfd616a5465adaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1a975a3f49019c125b23f3fa539c3d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f42f6e58eedeab1b226d75d6b9835bea"

Several reports suggested the epidemiological association of FeMV infection with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and the genetic diversity of FeMV as well as the relationship between FeMV infection and CKD in cats from Northern Italy. Urine (n = 81) and kidney samples (n = 27) from 92 cats admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Milan between 2014 and 2017 were investigated for FeMV infection. FeMV RNA was detected in one urine sample (1.23%; 95% CI: 0.03–6.68%) and in two kidneys (7.40%; 95% CI: 0.91–24.28%). FeMV RNA was revealed only in urine or kidneys of cats without evidence of CKD. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the three strains clustered with FeMV strains retrieved from public database, forming a distinct sub-cluster of FeMV. The presence of distinct genotypes of FeMV found in this study is in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that FeMV strains are genetically diverse. A clear relationship between the presence of FeMV infection and CKD in the cats from Northern Italy was not observed, confirming recent reports that do not support the hypothesis that FeMV infection is associated with the development of CKD.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18bc2e8d3ec0eba6c9288d78cd0be143, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cae89b91e6b3d119909d50436f56143, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22ca351a96c917fbb279c219d2dce7aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296a8dbda76d148ad1bce19281e796fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31038df16277c2de812988ba01584b6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/336e0b0cab7dbcc508489200bbdcfd24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/345c6c67de2384f7f50675e9274e8d6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41566a1c10d89cb64b04db538bccfd6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cd94d50144b4d7e211160fe2022ec25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5540ed4fb7c45d3050249cc6e23245a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56130be90a7bf1515acb8fbb8499c8b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/592a1d60320c001249ae7a03f7e3b8d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6002eb2cdb61461a77593a03b2a31263, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64fa8565a39dbb2a2d429343586813be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e36e95d6821180167e3c021ac92e32a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8702e869d19e3e97a0d0e4951ce438dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/882cdaed0e2c8a75a68f53805bfb94e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/957a0b4fea1f9d3bccfce2403e744719, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dd74cd9a260be0ea7bf73377350c15d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ecc6e9b399d61cd74d91599f61e11b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b97eddc78ef258ca6b3e042168e33e0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c20b03476f9a2a865e2912254a388086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3f110ec085e6278456071bae62a6cf0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9d4737bb2818846a9c2c99125a80338, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcba717a7cce69664fa18bd0ae71327f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3e904c897cf2a33423d012846842804, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3f82fcc4c836224b7dab54b26b540db"

Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6-vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6-vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07166fdd6a5b81e910f9f7888e214167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08ad8b6e74f77fe03a02182231182355, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e8206c53bbb7368443e4efb961b627f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13c852becb139a26a1fa1bcbea89fb69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18fd57b6b075dcc2c8c8416a9474f338, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2635cdf198b935230cb3ac99b7b5823a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/269915e32439093a7da69de8fd4cd9e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26d2af3d70b9f8c4bc5d50ee6ec33319, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/285e093ae6c6d99ef25442920c607752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28ecf391ffe9b0cf890258204b603f9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ae62cf3d1445e2b002efc70a6cb6f8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/475b5d3c672b3283b0f74843871ae942, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e22f98e3c89fa56f11b6354f219ba08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57ae66a2729080cb5be86ecc5a13121b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57e85fe69a7aff9c1773ae0b3500e782, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5efae9df8318c1802d62e0fd08c6bf69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/695a498c8ddf67b678313c11b2a4399f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70b484dded2e847fe927096fb23bc2e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74751f9f1601b2577a2f10b7d00beced, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/774f91ca6c0e5c46565a1c873033c7d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88a6a9c12396869a45e3b2db4f22ec9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d606eabeba51a1248fa9dc6c4c3bfa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9620ef954568459a1f7228946b305e2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9728f6561559aa00b21826386d882096, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b7b08b28cdc59d26c841f395d05ef10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4c2d6d1640f5ccdf7b82ebcfa5aa93e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8f34c9a7c956c33a871b2daccdbaa48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abeaec0b62bdf0b82ad844e47f85bf19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3a4d4028683fceb2cfb701c75f5414f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4e2ebe43c0c1d1044b3aa76acc38ac6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/beedccdbede2722ef3c038d62ca66e15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c59d66a8f7f5fb40e708eca9ffff81c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc82912024a71dd79ac048bd7880aa8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5b598ff1a8095ced38b41564cd6a4ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc241a90e38d7560561aca0a03209d12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1bba31ec04ce526eca01fd1929205e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9bf66afc48649e63e914d368860ae10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb8eaf59f1cfafcbf0b382b29f78b630, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc76f1e4aa71f9cae77e295beafe8d09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe3dbc18e4cfdb969e37e55f91769e56"

The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics protocols.

We hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a systemic disease whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel diagnostic or therapeutic targets.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0065ce9e532c7961c7cf4ce911afb4b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fe2f9b13398f99895c9e39b1977e8ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cf141970a28d78785cf5069e4335aba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24936fab3348faebd1e545c8a6005969, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27c7a8a86a613a9392f6911819bee75d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f1874f148a50606b1feb77fd6cd2091, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/322b0869c70a3c41a16efc89126ef7c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4430404a38a4c0da435eb796ed7c5e5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4506570a4bf8e6cbf812b5161aaa0406, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51877aa8f34ed5f285676600c6e7af3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56c91bf3140ed3147c28e4812eefcbad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fc377330dff6ea7de61e9344eb5dfbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6222d6ae4f096cee285c144aca99e0ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63074da9c4424c447e149c284cffb87a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/659b62678f4228604a3e8127e8e2f3e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/696b9c46f1e877a45262bd719bc42893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c219352a5626a6428a5ed11c1ceb2ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bc19bbfd8868c5835031f0756dd4794, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bfb6e57fd5da2508acf7d46ce88f256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c0355960e394f2d98253ba9dfbd0bfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fa3557daebc5dcfe68f757f6a08be86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8927afdcad58bc0310157af28721d9eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a0d044253aa9e40704b9ad01e6f00b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad4dddbfd515a905826ec807275d8feb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad518ce888146e8caaafd929be46286e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3c084d0c89b63b83bdbabccf7ff27c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b615e4faf403c2e289229b62f60f9ee0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b823d9768a75a5f0149cd78c65f15f5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b97573995ac4846d649dce33da469b43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba4bcb74c2b39582417ebc8945b39608, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb7edc3c48a158ff4cdf02656abf283a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc1865efd2f84665980b748921ce0699, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c43419e05b54eae772bbf20d7cf8e6bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0f7df84c080384e70efac939e2b49ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1d14cefe94140f6152650cae38e7bcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e26494e5c8470d2e78d25b8f092185a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e767c27c1ef64e73fa633d39904c39a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e77fd7361ee23754bdf51b484b5c2cb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea1b4311fe056145451c39227ac29a3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecd27f24cc601e66d86543c753d05035, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1d2109416c068f2cd5cd9fee6d257ae"

HHV-6 variant B causes the common childhood disease exhanthem subitum, and although the pathologic characteristics for HHV-6 variant A are less well defined, HHV-6A has been suggested to be more neurotropic. We studied the effect of both HHV-6 variants in an oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3.13). Infection of M03.13 was monitored by cytopathic effect (CPE), quantitative TaqMan PCR for viral DNA in cells and supernatant, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) to detect viral protein expression. HHV-6A infection induced significantly more CPE than infection with HHV-6B. HHV-6B induced an abortive infection associated with a decrease of the initial viral DNA load over time, early RNA expression, and no expression of viral antigen. In contrast, infection with HHV-6A DNA persisted in cells for at least 62 days. During the acute phase of infection with HHV-6A, intracellular and extracellular viral load increased and cells expressed the viral protein IE-2 and gp116/54/64. No HHV-6A RNA or protein was expressed after 30 days post infection, suggesting that HHV-6A formed a latent infection. These studies provide in vitro support to the hypothesis that HHV-6 can actively infect oligodendrocytes. Our results suggest that HHV-6A and HHV-6B have different tropism in MO3.13 cells and that an initially active HHV-6A infection can develop latency. Differences between HHV-6A and -6B infection in different neural cell types may be associated with different neurological diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01db346fd1d4133dc9bc3fc17981a0d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/057a1c862882ae3aa16e74b684afeabd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/063a8a33d3d00625090a41ea27075cf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/065433b15b6404f67e4e85f2808aa6d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07b663780eb43edee5f057e765ce713d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e00bdfac28d1ed3ebde1fb37002e22c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1253ad51016b4809c620ec0d44fe8d34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12dd7ff925bda874b85f2ee4ae3164aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16f3e028d2ce570bf894689d32e92300, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2094c3fdc51c765ea498a222f4e587df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/224d956ecf6dc37130eb93187fd5301e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aec48778bc452be89783e26d7e28054, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/349b7e56fd53eab61b358a5d7134083c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34bbad86454a43472f5006b0c900bbd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/376de6d9ce7de1542967cd7fd3b5fcb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b2fd4eebef8bab7d8190386307f0d89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c4219dea0ced8f242308e7e31142c18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40829061336490c839a518fb2e07a746, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/408360c0b6debe81abd3823ea4a0406d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40dd24f85dd7d5c65965620d6d4fd7a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41a3be59ccff11d08a59f76cfe8d2614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a942a53492e4d55f07fbb59a506eb0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ab7cb4ab534cdbb79f6f9be0e1658e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50dd1104446c1c225338aa6e3e40593e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/568a8ec921cbdd80d501b50f7b7d1484, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5aadb59330ee0e74130c0f9a3ccfbb05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b307e4105f8594edb715cee3afae49f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5da3971a2d1a568d2c71e2fa1031369b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fd07d6d9c8105f6475f77c80d4c464e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6152a267419ca081c57a3fb8287d3106, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65c9c733c18e3f3dd7974acf0d80fc6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/666f1895a4b4db7070cadfe777dd3985, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7235668b90b64402dea4417dd2d78cb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74d3df1127a5c4af3443b4d6c55e22e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dd09b8abcbeb4c5bb27aa08d2050429, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8411cbb995aa445faa769a92493eff44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86102f6d639dc63461d3c9b8341a67dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91f57d1760640d60217475e4f1636d35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/990244090cee4b8d10da8f68f964377b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1ee8aa7cbd7cf8f56fb5633c8cb9da8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a216dd53ff4494f503492142ae139766, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a30351a4c676a06961e34167ff55f889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b35c1cd9ffcd37816248a6eac3aa2b69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b52df3bdf3fb23e69c305aae675b68b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc0d51912db28766abff32e46928870a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf730a49b223463d5b0efaddc534f4f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1db8856125de6773194a0dacad36d2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd9cdee595b29ccf0ae014bb15d2c74b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd451c4ce9951bf2bc7e7dd6a93efe58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd72eae2360aae8188dfac2e91feb090, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1706a0cd29843054a86939186f8c9aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5af1405bee8e4161c58de2949181b28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6cf3d71860fb115f44b57298edf8631, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed25dd32c7e5e736e46cd636d135bad6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f11af739eaf38bae3ea7a7b10b19254c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffad89b4be935bf2a1b214f1b9da7c5b"

This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc γ receptor (FcγR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody, 2.4G2, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcγR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcγR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-FcγR monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1540964a8ccd5b94943f19c532f73b09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1548d76040775fcbe6cdf9b69721ebdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/193c68b63b5d7bc32c408199aaab0107, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19816d27f8fb1f487a68dc64d02e59e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a3856405bdef19d2267b58b1b7515a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b6d9cec543d68d75d1b0c2cb5753f7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c8a322546c92d34d4eaa3b21b7b614e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d892a3c915f643943b2f52ffaeda6a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3988d2d5cbcca674468d7ba3ca701103, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e92488f71d14c7a8c8c40621fe18019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41a33d6c6395101808e558e3575ff995, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41af1f17382ba03d2a86e51913d21558, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/441f88a57d98c6e574be06561481fe97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/461e08581b7a1c2a2c47e6094e26e0f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fc53791cbd1abee2c92e6f6c7053057, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/617f38d8f7613d9e3e89e578c4f04893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/697a53837442b19302fcbd75a550e83e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/701490a87be87a769b63e463751511ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/779a657c81423e4ef6d486ef5a7443a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f790d638b166a78228cba2c079f466c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83156c27a4981c7dd382e401676c81d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83c550d384fa93f0cf49cbf5394660bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/877d3ba036de1101f133775f43feb407, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87df4c806d8a7353f81eb3261fd5482d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929407869f6166e5673354d30737b562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/934c35517418ff6e0479ba36d161025b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a3fb316cea9bacd2185a73943bad18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b6a261a6480798ab581205fa3d694b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c63c5abe0b111c31bcfd2c5cd63e93c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e17c94c50ed11f87a4ccb4f5a92f409, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a102db6e461b4102d4aedcf591d61fe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a89de72610c01e94bd794e984acea10a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7f543b74e1aafa8cd28283853095315, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b99469e56e127cdfc59886590c67cfa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb56afc671bd4761656f2fd86f1b5e84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c09f8f7c71882fef35765b9d1962835d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca442b3e481d7c347ed7beb50e5c321f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d07d135cbccc9e87c94956960f8eb30f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3f6ac65f45e249a55dcc43f0eb069a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d60f8af793cdac45411f555a780ef63b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da5b073efa489275d1c0c9d812a410ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea221cf9c230abdf1125b915ff96dec8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eca04d7812699f12d47a45e78a42f3f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7c319423afd4abc232748de4cb41503"

In metropolitans such as Hong Kong and other Asian cities, the surge of electricity consumption has been phenomenal over the past decades. This paper presents a historical review about electricity consumption, population, and change in economic structure in Hong Kong. It is hypothesized that the growth of electricity consumption and change in gross domestic product can be modeled by 4-parameter logistic functions. The accuracy of the functions was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient, mean absolute percent error, and root mean squared percent error.

Monte Carlo simulations were applied to determine the confidence intervals of pollutant emissions.

The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus–host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control. Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis. In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model. By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0025d16c8727f69bda5fdba8ab8e8b41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01c9cc861e889d624477248ea27a75e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01e91333fbf22fd0397887267d0d4a51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0473bf06950d196ad4b21d5cf04140ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05c388fb7bbf7042ee7bbc2e918dade8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c2e68923ee886d7a80675b1af157cb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11bd73a5f7cf43af903305e579a760ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/141cf20edf23ced863a13437ec3a630d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/151be62101c23b1d44f1f1ded56344cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ce9597450569ad79b7e89b5dc15c76a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ec05c1daf5baa33ec6880699cacaa61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21f0c2844691d848ebe29c8fa53964c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25141934de89e19e1dfd5c798787900e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26458620d0104f73eeeb65c6ae04a015, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26a6ba28322adbe4a8ca48567e87731d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29ffeb14b7d150089aa5bee348b3b0bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2be181bd7cbb4117434cfbbf10269e4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2db3e5cdeff66f890eb8c395932b6d6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32b135720138431ec039f2b357827eb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a57585043ce6954b95b3c46f109ce30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bc841d6219dc252278fd3ded494279f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d31909256e52f7d927c2d0247af22e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f2f0d7f5257aff7210682045e137ef1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/510a0ed251efadf305c398107a17fb40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/583760b3c6cd39075d907e3ae5ea646d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5862b3dafe2b857d38f8dcb77e2ad484, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c6ab8eac1f777f61d86c2d9f471a8e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75faed3512a67ae02e08314692cc0326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f50c94f5108f10fe71c85e9f8c7863e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/820f1f056708b03931e35b64c8d9edc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86d76dcce60743afc66ac37853c48804, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d333d0deb9d49ed91a654f7a499c03a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dc81b859525be4f3abc72c4f2edda81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e0330f425022b48732181a22804771d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e2336d159b8031fe4d0d148d4ac7d1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92c29a1bc2615911d21f818d5722df71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d6b0ab8413c39715bd16058847473b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/963b32a69a78ffeeb879b7b6424bea63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/985b816f3dc295b583681e1ff38eb47d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/998652dad93f39ee4480405fff550024, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ce097d21770bcdbeaeecab0ce268e9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d21d6f3d2ed8c896ce037c9eeb0aae7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8ce0e97817aa954ac668bcf394ed2eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c34d88ec43fab631bafd663c3c74d034, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cab26331b41f6c9a3426e28582b75693, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbe4dc3417cea518c2028dfcbfc5e54a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b1f03db95615c2f09b0e085cf30967, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de11b6ba87e337d7906ff0c0bcb7e501, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e33e123f7517ad7ef85bd2e0c7617dfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5735c8d1fb3e4320da2dc87bcf64076, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed60a86f1a8dec51f70b1bd2aa56abf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1785b1052ceec2563ccadbba31735f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f758ad8eca481b004065b1c50c4628f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb5af483b8fc9dc131bda797fbe3b066, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffcb84930cf22929c90b983a35c73df5"

When first introduced to a population, a pathogen is often poorly adapted to its new host and must evolve in order to escape extinction. Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the ‘riskiest’ contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect. In most situations, increasing overall mutation probability increases the risk of emergence; however, notable exceptions arise when deleterious mutations are available.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/100ffea40b51af990b95fe8e89ba63b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/136a76164a4ebd294b1d26479b2132eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27f6e059ae0c193d3693a22bee414927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/288f8a2f58ad57e1ed0fff538d7e0397, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39d0abfb149c311d3b14305726a1bed8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45ea21cf392243282740f11ae02ab6d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/465ec06143a0962b8281def8f93dc6b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5766db70bcad4300a3b4cecef4f7ea2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58c8f871d0d7fc318cc1aeae5945bd2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/677dd11aa72b9290da00a4e5dfd298da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/679509997c22f7a15a50f51ac42b87d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67a8bc8bec71b58fef38733f16900255, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c38843bdcbdfd5753971a4c168d4e1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77da72388a3d2c068764daa8594f7174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91b1302350c2269f783e1bd866d76f87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbfaf6daf5221324fbcc840057265d62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6ed320ae6766e39dca2999ffcbd93e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9f6e581cc26cbdd48fa9d7a0d782fdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d57f130ddaf54a9003d9f199ed86734c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcbf6ba49c72ab348f467ed38379af54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd5df9fd98dc64c6725ab3535e4faaca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e51b23fe3efa565f8af07124e1bda881, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f192adff275844edd07e08806def248d"

An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with β-lactam antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and β-lactam compared with treatment with β-lactam antibiotics only. The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22). RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia. LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses. Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients. In addition, LTA plasma concentration could be too low to mount a response via Toll-like receptor 2 in vitro, but may nonetheless have an effect in vivo.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c0a8be6a3d3223588edfdce7d3eb36a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a6ae6821993679559fe9402816f851e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/788e2d2464b07875767aba2edf82d129, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78b56ffe2d6c4be1fce537093f574c37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/798321908f24ea203270d2d76dfee5e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84546fef5b98871f070a63c54b9b3c30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/962f2320e48785b6b302ea449b647660, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daff2131fc1043462c9775621307f7fa"

Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker “retinoic acid” in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5′–AGGTCA–3′) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required). The numbers of RARE sequence repeats appeared to match with the virulence of screened positive viruses.

We studied SARS case reports through April 30, 2003, including data from case investigations and a case series analysis of index cases. A total of 1,454 clinically confirmed cases (and 55 deaths) occurred; the epidemic peak was in the first week of February 2003. Healthcare workers accounted for 24% of cases. Clinical signs and symptoms differed between children (<18 years) and older persons (>65 years). Several observations support the hypothesis of a wild animal origin for SARS.

These demyelinating diseases appear to arise from complex interactions of genetic, immunological, infective, and biochemical mechanisms. While circumstances of MS etiology remain hypothetical, one persistent theme involves recognition by the immune system of myelin-specific antigens derived from myelin basic protein (MBP), the most abundant extrinsic myelin membrane protein, and/or another equally susceptible myelin protein or lipid component. Knowledge of the biochemical and physical—chemical properties of myelin proteins and lipids, particularly their composition, organization, structure, and accessibility with respect to the compacted myelin multilayers, thus becomes central to the understanding of how and why these antigens become selected during the development of MS. This review focuses on current understanding of the molecular basis underlying demyelinating disease as it may relate to the impact of the various protein and lipid components on myelin morphology; the precise molecular architecture of this membrane as dictated by protein—lipid and lipid—lipid interactions; and the relationship, if any, between the protein/lipid components and the destruction of myelin in pathological situations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1350820d06ec3bd84e0a67533c2ee2fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e7b1a46d2db84401f95666e600661a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25155ffbb8cc7e127d8ab89433cca7b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3140ff68b86ea8a304409f6b99f78795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3920542bf7725236d2620424d52a7740, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/393e324ca64b190124e2c59c9617f1aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c7624b21ed20eb874fb73007cf6b085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/443979bac4c0e4b9c66b1f4ce2855cbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46ccc839d6423ff3b98736271c3da31f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49d18f0eada9153161b70ad5181ed88e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c7eab218375d1ef9df5c7ef2a8d69c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/624f3b238185d004314ecca907fa9393, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/712925db56e80b38735a0ff3509415a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72d727f2e4854cf6e360ff58ba761187, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d32766de6fad6d261acdc54ae4d28b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/801839dbd931867f6e1c1b4586c57bb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82bfc605692b5ede10d35f75cd2a57ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84e1dc94df9e9525dd4fb373ae92ca41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e2409a5d1de47cbc3e7e85ec43ee8a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/911913d05db99ecd6558aa00033a3601, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4a2b960aa5c07e69f4844bbef658a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afce9c89c5c0cc9dd52ff1a66117cdcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1d4326dd7c6d62bc4dc55ccd52d402e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc106884d7de3eaa58a0a818fe832357, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcb25ddca6eb36bbc9d9fe1e71c3f4ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bec17eecd81b8539989c710da3796343, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb7a4265af3e2207c92a913de49bb218, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ceff3ebb7bf05edb48791b83f0aeff02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2e2cea640574db45798c16bd319250f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da26061e12afed4ca26ce004b8bbac7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db3b6077777c990b7d87dac24e88dfb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e005373f0b4680288e1824c8a0d2f333, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e58e332fa4222d88a24c86f7c5470af0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0fee9114d7870cd8f0afeaabb5e2ab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb9ff223cd8b853fb6d09501b7691e1c"

Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (IU) (P = 0.013) HIV-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (IP) (P = 0.025) HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors. The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU (P = 0.045 and P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (P = 0.025, for int2-180A) HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f9db38f36ef3d0b8db190f8850b4e14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/153fdc815a46e10a3ee95af9dc236f60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2931664fd571fbe71175fb48b12bd11d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e2cf1b5b5159ec111df4f339d688bd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fc062a549d49f62269ed6f5cb93cf0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c33b6779ebb41b3fb1648b36a02e5ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/467d87e313644dcf27564bac2299a863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a50a64213e095b2ccac30530df2f6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51e3e30e19427a7e21e6bc302be85abf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/599f63d49469c7fc2a7c07de023ee5e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eb126370ac14f8f4f47ca370e498e73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7222d8fc99aaaf9d76380f149c1bce66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/938edd56260c36a8d365e2c1135b23d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c486125143e54cc982e56d02971730ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfbfab6d9bc52a9b8a25e209383920a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2b5d24aa1fd565bb7cd4ceb0dacaaa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9e2e7905d3a79f07ac825b2f4136fbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1c52224597b0944b4d0149f0cf4a1d8"

Evolutionary genomics of viruses revealed many unexpected connections but the general scenario(s) for the evolution of the virosphere remains a matter of intense debate among proponents of the cellular regression, escaped genes, and primordial virus world hypotheses. A comprehensive sequence and structure analysis of major virion proteins indicates that they evolved on about 20 independent occasions, and in some of these cases likely ancestors are identifiable among the proteins of cellular organisms. Virus genomes typically consist of distinct structural and replication modules that recombine frequently and can have different evolutionary trajectories. The present analysis suggests that, although the replication modules of at least some classes of viruses might descend from primordial selfish genetic elements, bona fide viruses evolved on multiple, independent occasions throughout the course of evolution by the recruitment of diverse host proteins that became major virion components.",""

The degeneration of F(1) and back-cross macrophages obtained either from adult mouse peritoneal exudate or newborn mouse liver, occurred more slowly than PRI macrophages. Segregation of susceptibility occurred in the first back-cross generation. Tests of three back-cross generations from susceptible mice yielded about one-quarter of the mice shown to be susceptible either by direct test or test of their macrophages. A clear correlation between susceptibility in vivo and in vitro was established both in the test of the percentage segregation and in tests of individual back-cross mice. A small series of tests, however, indicated that 50 per cent of the back-cross mice had the genetic capacity to transmit susceptibility. Thus a hypothesis of two genes for susceptibility, although not excluded, may yield to a hypothesis of a single dominant gene, incompletely expressed.

Infection enhancement was initially demonstrated by using heat-inactivated, virus-specific feline antiserum. Functional compatibility between murine immunoglobulin molecules and feline Fc receptors was demonstrated by using murine anti-sheep erythrocyte serum and an antibody-coated sheep erythrocyte phagocytosis assay. Thirty-seven murine monoclonal antibodies specific for the nucleocapsid, membrane, or spike proteins of feline infectious peritonitis virus or transmissible gastroenteritis virus were assayed for their ability to enhance the infectivity of feline infectious peritonitis virus. Infection enhancement was mediated by a subset of spike protein-specific monoclonal antibodies.

Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature’s genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (p < 0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions.

Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the non-structural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0206d436ce7eef73a5a3f7d844934f71,

A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNV’s greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features – impressive in themselves – attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.Significance StatementRNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication. The upper genome size for such entities was assumed to be <35 kb; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the proposed evolution of contemporary DNA-RNP-based life from primordial RNP entities. Here, we describe a nidovirus from planarians, whose 41.1 kb genome is 23% larger than the largest known of RNA virus. The planarian secretory cell nidovirus has broken apparent constraints on the size of the genomic subregion that encodes core replication machinery, and has acquired genes not previously observed in RNA viruses. This virus challenges and advances our understanding of the limits to RNA genome size.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d9a24e8405216e78a0f159861505b46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b0c4587207c1024d95fe3e55e5dbb09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c38be511c97d5b163725ad4e0a1d292, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2644b5af8615a0b28a65c09beecebf03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31d804723836cced96b438ef7482ae18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e8ae91f777d8456cdc768f8414d8742, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4216773d99724f6c06edd69744a11001, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4294d2f480e853a4dd8be2cc37027a01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4870f7bb664d4c51b9a75e37d64294c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48b3ac833da5d776d52bd21dff457a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52ef0c291c1082bca88882eb0136a5ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59cd505c0040654b7df302664bae4008, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65d83ca870a3d991269e89703e759d98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6af7a24e7980ea239518d78a6172f4a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c1032aec34471af68dc81a4d536f3a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74ca5e70d1cb2f571f6dc87aebe62dbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75f8f469c93cbe6edf22db81b4fe934d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c1968a73639ffcf9d0de335a5a808e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87398c4269c2a1b40a8846457dc09724, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87a317ae9f3f1fa7549c6db4cbed6e86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87eb91b768fda17d231bcb7f65cdcd95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89eb5cb1b60a06a38d3605349b61afdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9013ef83db8b790aa1f49aeae187c952, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/980e125177a44b56d20fc4e17daf7c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a47a79d5c6d21737072d3a7f786f0811, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa784a0e1ff6fdb50f0d01a2a95802d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2ea21e8d7d78479050d8c30f1091072, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b33d6dfcb76d9f613f7ca12732ae5ea7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d49b828c7baea604e769093cf8c94f80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0e6853d11e2ba5fc46ef7fe6134e5b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e14ac3b37993e9b714602ff823eea66a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb537f0d8100016fc28b7f2ccf27e94d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c77fef910f89342b8e8176daa526cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb1a0a0dbfe684e8ec5ac2f44b194d8e"

Despite the fact that several assays are available, identification of an etiological agent is not possible in ∼30% of patients suffering from respiratory tract diseases. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a diagnostic set for the detection of respiratory viruses with sensitivity as low as 1–10 copies per reaction. Evaluation of the assay using a training clinical sample set showed that viral nucleic acids were identified in ∼76% of cases. To improve assay performance and facilitate the identification of novel species or emerging strains, cultures of fully differentiated human airway epithelium were used to pre-amplify infectious viruses. This additional step resulted in the detection of pathogens in all samples tested. Based on these results it can be hypothesized that the lack of an etiological agent in some clinical samples, both reported previously and observed in the present study, may result not only from the presence of unknown viral species, but also from imperfections in the detection methods used.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1691f6687446efeb54ae7e4680067a3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2efc5fe669b096692f33c9bb89178ac3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43d229c38d2ed8c391374ce672c21242, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b7ad9928bb28fcee7bc68bd632e4b93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b15ab12c55cac7af004e98c201ab3a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d0b434222a8e94396b2d3d9034ef6ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f8b616cdcffb4ec4429b605fca57656, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b21c8d78605d50d0f0ac656eddd22bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9de6a4f3497a8a8549694f7f957c8ccb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a835038ef8ec145712eb6a67de2db792, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5f565bc4d9817bbf85b4ad84549aeb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d29e1c404e80bf8ca92b28b108b3b355, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4f21f118234d69f525216ac8d03ef83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da03b205a081ea189d296a381c68ea18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f047f0f789e64474c5fd4fc32060e2c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f24e32e6eda9d7148d46504ad3f74dee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2e7df57fdace8a0bc38bddedd5aaeb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe2ee9a5f28aba14d58734a7aa10b0c2"

In this review, we examine assembly of virus capsids, focusing on hepatitis B virus and bacteriophage MS2, and formation of glycoproteins in the alphaviruses. These systems are structurally and biochemically well-characterized and are simplest-case paradigms of self-assembly. Published data suggest that capsid and glycoprotein assembly is subject to allosteric regulation, that is regulation at the level of conformational change. The hypothesis that allostery is a common theme in viruses suggests that deregulation of capsid and glycoprotein assembly by small molecule effectors will be an attractive antiviral strategy, as has been demonstrated with hepatitis B virus.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0492363cddc99441479ee37495b6d59b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0610b46ca0357433530d771e928c70f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f0dd2860e4412af4d29755a90ece73b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d8ef713afb3486783814c9a1783438b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20be3643585e0c0b6b9ad38e962addb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aefedc04f2608785ae9736c4cd2c754, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fd5f13710e01c0a8fe70271289514b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6922ad9a5f7886de9d65c6e6e923a8a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dd82c5084fe8d58ccb653bfc6dc9f3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/769ef7fb85ecd94ceb1d81a4c29b0ae0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87448fa5d57c43bd3ebdd892862e04d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8873766e728141e53fb3990e8bff2993, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cbae742e05894f2a66d88f720e268db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4417930b72c5014e8d128267a82f47b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb73bb3e5e034af2f2eaa332b5f3f1df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd36264eae56a9e424a600cf69f98dab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc0c2025a8e065cb742354ca20602872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddd3bf460ac21adf14a29cf1a3504497, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5b361fb7c8eb0cf4ca01c07a7d3e24b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eccb23117aad49baaea3375fea7ce276"

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between postnatal gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h after birth, with or without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) suckled by sow (S, n = 8); 2) suckled by sow plus administration of a fat supplement (SF, n = 5); 3) bottle-fed solely milk replacer (B, n = 8); or 4) bottle-fed solely milk replacer plus administration of a fat supplement (BF, n = 7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r > 0.6; p < 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p < 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts. Findings support that vaginal swabs can be used to noninvasively study effects of perinatal nutrition on tissue composition.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/028d08252925b48efe58c862b3dd4e2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/039e85e3a26175231bd8f3838aa99e30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05d5fb58bd676495f747fbb01a1a7e7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05e0e8435921e985717258a539a961a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09652d8760dc0d506acf22c102c5ad9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a347a1582a070e9884c841386823893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d22a9fa00abb3e32f4693c6639e3059, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10d4f69ea917159af3739e58f93572ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18bbb335b177b31034b5d384e73be9b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d1639b2dcc2cec5f0d3fac0b47db563, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2df5284cbd133f988bd291d04c17713a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/302c798a000aeb90103e63fa72777228, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32af9b0c71829d79570b9f55b27541fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3aed4417a22be5163dd4d55b709a116b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/407c8ae7c2d328bcd44bd89dac835b13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b4ce45419077e0f7303515c69934304, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f7fa44869d2d28a26374de88b120dd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bfe951f3969593df0249e0ee5d50257, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/743d896f2d593a52fcf887db115dd19a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7752442c31fe16faa1bd5364dc026587, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fb3a4380a76f16fe58215e8bfd66562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81c4fa3157bd2da9e38197a1f7271c9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bc1a6a3f0f88cc0f3baf65963ae9b3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92dcccb6cfde380bcbae4a040a381e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d8ee6737d3f556d9b018a277f077c5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a20db2f6a53d8eaf2c4efe0b14e915a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b18fa36f125136b78dd48574ffb59891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9d4a08c6ced9c62434cfeef5cce670b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bed2b35a572e8129ca4adae1bdb7b3cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb4fc3428bed935d5d487407ceea2102, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d049940c1dbc1ede4e3e1de3986d317d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9bd4d484c789e0369e181e70f0f3ec0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1129a98d2da9ce213de2ae03ead91bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e22b81cd177a28af04f125a6728cfa87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eba2eaf53cad7f51d4b58678cd382c3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1da9195e4192ecf188aeb56507b0ef9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f689980d7a1361b826dea3eab3a1a67c"

The NS2(H126R) mutant is attenuated in liver replication due to loss of phosphodiesterase activity, which the wild-type (WT) virus uses to block the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L (RNase L) antiviral pathway. The activation of RNase L by NS2(H126R) is cell type dependent and correlates with high basal expression levels of OAS, as found in myeloid cells. We tested the hypothesis that the resident liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (KC), represent the cell type most likely to restrict NS2(H126R) and prevent hepatitis. As found previously, A59 and NS2(H126R) replicate similarly in hepatocytes and neither activates RNase L, as assessed by an rRNA degradation assay. In contrast, in KC, A59 exhibited a 100-fold-higher titer than NS2(H126R) and NS2(H126R) induced rRNA degradation. Interestingly, in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), the cells that form a barrier between blood and liver parenchymal cells, NS2(H126R) activates RNase L, which limits viral replication. Similar growth kinetics were observed for the two viruses in KC and LSEC from RNase L(−/−) mice, demonstrating that both use RNase L to limit NS2(H126R) replication. Depletion of KC by gadolinium(III) chloride or of LSEC by cyclophosphamide partially restores liver replication of NS2(H126R), leading to hepatitis. Thus, during mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, hepatitis, which damages the parenchyma, is prevented by RNase L activity in both KC and LSEC but not in hepatocytes. This may be explained by the undetectable levels of RNase L as well as by the OASs expressed in hepatocytes. IMPORTANCE Mouse hepatitis virus infection of mice provides a useful tool for studying virus-host interactions during hepatitis development. The NS2(H126R) mutant is attenuated in liver replication due to loss of phosphodiesterase activity, by which the wild-type virus blocks the potent OAS-RNase L antiviral pathway. RNase L activation by NS2(H126R) is cell type dependent and correlates with high basal expression levels of OAS, as found in myeloid cells. We showed that the hepatocytes that comprise the liver parenchyma do not activate RNase L when infected with NS2(H126R) or restrict replication. However, both Kupffer cells (KC) (i.e., the liver-resident macrophages) and the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) which line the sinusoids activate RNase L in response to NS2(H126R). These data suggest that KC and LSEC prevent viral spread into the parenchyma, preventing hepatitis. Furthermore, hepatocytes express undetectable levels of OASs and RNase L, which likely explains the lack of RNase L activation during NS2(H126R) infection.",""

CoVs encode a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00be696d59467dbb548f28a2c8d2c13c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01e58e543ed637f478673712ebe173e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0371d878182c9c1682a646039c5e5177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/050e1f8ddd76184f02961f2ee2c96196, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12390710bf621ea72704963c46605b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1adc0c0935fc33aa75ae520d957af788, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e09d07ab18238961ea0aef18326846c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21e4dc11e04cec5e16272fd533de29b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25e5e20767acfc65be3356c3dd1c7a3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/290e24bf5b9b4839b4e56a053259fba6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a60157f45bcd5a2323eb635b1ba3bed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30c50a9c99603e8efc1717bff7804b07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31ca9cd3217518867b4606c55e684318, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32be07aaf086d8451d651b0f20336234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/356d5e02210fa8c95af0496dc672e810, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dc2478f7859022789df53274abca948, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42fb471ad09741e9dec457da000e260f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43c3ef06e165445960d2a30b8cca1a9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44d1da04730b211af69923d26bc1bec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b1a2ad8230ce419f9856415aa593f89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ba1acbcf52d616dd3737a9ccd306f6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d721bca83c82eb50bbc2c6a9beee1e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5458f34bcbaf2579e102b6fad8da9dd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55cc1574c67a187b3c128256960abf8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b7551ee9e493501ffb90e608758e1bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6046c11f5054ac81008badab32894bdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63f7c85bd819446373618e694eab2f5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b2c5ee5fadf88a0220d76ccd48717c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e273b09458ca61a687441b565c668a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a2c9ea26e710dd422c21814773529dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ad63af72a3de96ebbe431eadf1c0a1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c8616c563940d42e565dd5e4f53953d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/876eb13eaa5f00146f3cd4ee5e069f94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8da5ec036631ce822e035626a4f6ce5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e2ba7ac442021e1ebe4988f664e9875, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94da2ea3655a591e6833c8aebb33b2fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bfe3b0f10031c1735a47577905e247a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d461eeef8a0b671f5326baa621c1214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d7016c5372a7e682191a141472afae7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a252fd77ea284547fb8ddb2dbdf31301, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a497f39393794efa849c38bc53bb30dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abee9beadd4279faffaa36b9b00f501a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ace6ec86f9a4e900552e663206a11dcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b308d0933bbcab821034a35e2855d58b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4652be36f02e2271eb2e199e00ce40e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb070322457407b5f570e63e39361e66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c245f11576c0a416bf9a22c65d3e38f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c439747dd5abe4f4a84077c51160f0e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4f2eeadb11264121304a29a4c10189b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb928c31953703211ceac87d7c74d785, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd2aa70b704cd4a0dd14378990ea2843, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e08b6141ab9001f029a7c6286a248ea9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8238d2d67959644688a5eae13d106c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee6a6e32f7f8212fa31939b890d574f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eebad92ffb61def347dcbc37ef762579, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1a773665def22815bd42fb7f376144f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3e18ae341e77d80ea3ab95948bc5846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faabd2db42eb4da3b328a48bcbfcba4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb826ea9c8603404f01ba8a273e3bf48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd03dee857178d6ef38eaaa028da9380"

Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of its observed cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimising p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimises p so that R and N estimates properly adapt to the available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems. Our approach requires some knowledge of the parameter space and exposes the similarities between renewal and skyline models.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d2a05ad2c141a064a80595e09236f25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/151188833f1fd03649151bda7e15588d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b0b13839627c867c7221f3bc098338d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cbfc3170958ac351a197eb7d10d51f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/411cdec85fae2b214fcb0f5cc7eb1ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48cabfb359fadc36e2ebb681d61745cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49fbc56568090ea1d30c9a8f131a16d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/528335587d160d4217541a0c9139189a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56ae9bde91a472fe73f2af380369dd1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6570b4bad51511c664fc5a79af0bf2b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cb4819ac8e3c1cf3ec62a4b590f304b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75e785a4671532ff72e1a91318d9637e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79332dcfb7db517f3844aa8a15d950a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ee7cdb063a2824778f87194749bcf85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81464cf4069fd449b9102acd49b9e9a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b609ff8407d0a0acd3d807cadbc99ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3912e49e3e8ac19699506fe6b859a62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab9ee2d132666bbf1d729b6e7cb3fcf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae109c3a4ff52c4b25fb168b8735d171, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af57ebda140d9770c000a042af0dd48f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af5ebb85d88885b494c5a1049f670814, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b30fe788812204e7cd0de4694eea3399, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3665d1dfcf972ccf861687e539b5be4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb035b7a826532b9dfbfdc9a31606aa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c912829797090b0a225d5b8f2a61193e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f805eb411a8c68fd5967ea787e53ad16"

The emergence of these agents is heavily associated with zonotic animal hosts, as well as migratory pathways of infected bird vectors. The environmental survival and persistence of nucleic acid associated with these viral agents may be important for both the detection as well as the occurrence of related diseases. Our hypothesis suggests that nucleic acid from such emerging viruses may enter into a virus-parasite surrogate relationship to aid in viral persistence. We suggest that Cryptosporidium and other gastrointestinal parasites, including Giardia, could be a) a reservoir of genetic material and a environment where assortment between that genetic variation can occur and, b) a source of zoonoses through infection of the ‘target’ animal (including humans). One example which illustrates this may be the uptake dsRNA from rotavirus into cryptosporidial oocysts, as this parasite has previously been shown to contain dsRNA viral-like particles. The importance of such a surrogate relationship is discussed and its implications for human and animal health highlighted.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04c99b5773d19ac258832ef68efc69ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/069096a6b82e29a2bc7f1746ea83b965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09508dfef9f1338ea48803880cb16f1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eabaad5e0801cfe36c34d43f1a09a1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f2b5f4f24ba8970d9bdb5a56477927d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21cf538bed16151c7c6d8bc7c8eac9b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d491949c2f37cdcab15e5efbb4f6711, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ecb458c2e6972c719756cfab487d6bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4370b88df2b9918038285a6995fa0e55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/479f3371bd682a6735d28f2f5e3cfa9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61a5c671f8b303914fade3a91c9a6b2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b395bc149b6510b52493ff8b6fae9a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dba952c6e0e2a05bf6cdcea3fe41103, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9470c64d44b1296110f25e602430ab98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95bc91bcae046e7234519e84eb6ba49e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eb979a8a37cd3d43ed78183016d4412, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0f205fc03f4a7fa3abb03615fba4e57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3aa631ccde49151716bb1015dc07dc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b61e595154d56a1148975f50529b98ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8e322997178d5b285776c35505bf81d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7c0306e14fc1381d07c7073cd0bb1cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8cdca03362e608c88502b6e32ab06b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc24fd3c88e7f44aeec2ee14486a3074, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc82ec5a470b493c663739428ae94d4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcc0f5c83cd74066f67ff99b39e1536a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5c3b8926203c3621af95a79aa4831f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eaefbbb636f90d0d2c869c5a9a6b184b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f18c762973c37159e5c9246fc9a048fe"

This diagnostic gap could hypothetically be reduced with the broad implementation of molecular detection techniques like PCR, which has revolutionized the detection of infectious diseases during the last two decades. FINDINGS: We performed a longitudinal prospective study (N = 81) of neutropenic patients to assess the role of respiratory viruses in neutropenic fever and to determine the clinical relevance of blind screening for these viruses. Respiratory viruses were recovered in 14% of the patients prior to neutropenia. In 13% of neutropenic patients without fever and in 19% of those with fever, a respiratory virus was detected. Comparing different sample types; nasal swabs performed significantly better (16/117 = 43%), than throat swabs (6/106 = 6%). Throat gurgles did not show significant differences from the latter sample types. CONCLUSIONS: Blind diagnostic screening for respiratory viruses before or during neutropenia is not useful.

In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 – December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N = 1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N = 446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature ((ο)C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. RESULTS: Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio = 1.27; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04–1.56) and humidity (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10–1.65) were associated with increased cases 8–10 days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01–1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5–6 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/032356f8db8571b34c3b4997aca7b3d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a3c9ec8ecfbc08de33eca441ade78c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f381abcfc7b2656d248ed5eb217aed5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/570ccec2376f9819bdb1d8beec414bf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cddfd0e9d598e31ad6329d952d59ab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a070f28542787e2485e6791745d958a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a39c7bafad66a947a3ca312822ec2640, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6bb22cd570ccad55d31130ad2294fde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e819d54f1ccb4508fe7b3000a20bfa01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa2a69f3966b9dd1b7d0f4c255317b1e"

Recent data demonstrated increased urinary ACE2 in patients with diabetes with CKD and kidney transplants. We tested the hypothesis that urinary ACE2, NEP, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) are increased and could be risk predictors of CKD in patients with diabetes. ACE2, NEP, and ADAM17 were investigated in 20 nondiabetics (ND) and 40 patients with diabetes with normoalbuminuria (Dnormo), microalbuminuria (Dmicro), and macroalbuminuria (Dmacro) using ELISA, Western blot, and fluorogenic and mass spectrometric-based enzyme assays. Logistic regression model was applied to predict the risk prediction. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn, and prediction accuracies were calculated to explore the effectiveness of ACE2 and NEP in predicting diabetes and CKD. Results demonstrated that there is no evidence of urinary ACE2 and ADAM17 in ND subjects, but both enzymes were increased in patients with diabetes, including Dnormo. Although there was no detectable plasma ACE2 activity, there was evidence of urinary and plasma NEP in all the subjects, and urinary NEP was significantly increased in Dmicro patients. NEP and ACE2 showed significant correlations with metabolic and renal characteristics. In summary, urinary ACE2, NEP, and ADAM17 are increased in patients with diabetes and could be used as early biomarkers to predict the incidence or progression of CKD at early stages among individuals with type 2 diabetes.",""

RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210–230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-β promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6–30, 31–55, 56–80, 81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230, 231–248 or 249–265 lack functions of IFN–β mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR. Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa.81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230 or 231–248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-β suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/022ea3da53f9c67546235221d95a8b1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07368ae0da13057b34697b452ff22d1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13602f10b7aeae9e63ac824b2455439f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1778710177e027f5bf0ae9d1f775d902, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/254ba97cb29e05aaf16c81732e7175bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26570e4d5812cd6e283159caf9067557, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/278fcf7712dd5cf2883dd720e03e0445, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/289ff6d459506c1c6cdbaa806929f856, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ce965420c6f72dc1d2d9c6e0b6e5cb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/437f4ee4df44a1684685439ae709e757, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46bea0a4e008e4ac2a4aa32cdd8cbfb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/525b14c1676b33d00bf18df6ee066f7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52735645163e75252b0c6f135de04719, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56a007f37f2f39262df67294b0f72455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56c553b365654f265b4ac6ac1f9c3ac8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f4b154709c5aa200ab82a6c0e4ffbb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60b19e59a599530f793bdbc61d121ad5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6570cce2cd8dd0a902130bd716ad0483, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b859d85b1d98ef50bba24f90c11e8ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/736d3bc6a7b7afc8952359434a863910, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83e4aa7988385a2c8c92f71d7b6763af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f9b38ff5a163ac0cfc1f5230ab78660, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90b9783ebd7860fc69b0bd3e2a99913c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95940e35364c28256b6feb6cc8ef5f6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/983d5305fa8f2858a7653f05ee886337, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b8ff861aefb15f1015c343f598b71db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c3ce6ce5bec40e1e6f91c8fa73ec957, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1d6c8c5f064fcf9e17acfcd7b648c6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a66a59b00f25f3c955265114fded9662, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac727a348fe1d87f642d416b00ca8687, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aef51d010c1dd47e40ffcaef2bc59630, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc1f51c2e0285ac2a6bfdd3812ac7fac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c526185ce2817ff5a6adce10163ce333, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c68fbdbcd5d4e8a861ed7431fcff9b1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c75b083be39e7e41e75c00118b33aa56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8dd3f926aa44183e001c0f8d9c73566, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d64be09d7d528cdb873264100a54c1f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8e7489fe65c75b51ca7e76ad12bf96e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbb4394218851c0f0f612ba943ee2bcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3f48deeeeb766ad20c23360b30c2595, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e46ccc3744d15fd815b6f2ffaeb59940, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed9aaf87b1cc7bcd907848122bf06689, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1277edd38f606464a6815c10d29352d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f37efaceb6d6144a58a56566beb90a3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5d037bce133ec62e503d1191ec1019f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbdf4d6f9b4e3d3126db342711b9a264"

Data analysis revealed several significant differences in hematologic parameters between male and female sand rats but none for serum biochemistry analytes. The following hematologic parameters were greater in male than in female sand rats: RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell hemoglobin content, and percentage monocytes. Red cell distribution width, hemoglobin distribution width, mean platelet volume, and percentage lymphocytes were greater in female than in male sand rats.

Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future.",""

Some delay is necessary, but recent delays have been extended by insufficient surveillance capacity and time-consuming efforts to mobilize action. Three public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs)—H1N1, Ebola, and Zika—allow us to identify and compare sources of delays and consider seven hypotheses about what influences the length of delays. These hypotheses can then motivate further research that empirically tests them. The three PHEICs suggest that deferred global mobilization is a greater source of delay than is poor surveillance capacity. These case study outbreaks support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for novel diseases when outbreaks do not coincide with holidays and when US citizens are infected. They do not support hypotheses that we see quicker responses for more severe outbreaks or those that threaten larger numbers of people. Better understanding the reason for delays can help target policy interventions and identify the kind of global institutional changes needed to reduce the spread and severity of future PHEICs.",""

Interactions between co-infecting parasites include resource competition, direct competition and immune-mediated interactions and each are likely to alter the dynamics of single parasites. We posit that co-infection is a driver of variation in parasite establishment and growth, ultimately altering the production of parasite transmission stages. To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus, the respiratory bacterial pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica lux(+) or co-infected with both parasites. To follow co-infection simultaneously, self-bioluminescent bacteria were used to quantify infection in vivo and in real-time, while helminth egg production was monitored in real-time using faecal samples. Co-infection resulted in high bacterial loads early in the infection (within the first 5 days) that could cause host mortality. Co-infection also produced helminth ‘super-shedders’; individuals that chronically shed the helminth eggs in larger than average numbers. Our study shows that co-infection may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the often-observed high variance in parasite load and shedding rates, and should thus be taken into consideration for disease management and control. Further, using self-bioluminescent bacterial reporters allowed quantification of the progression of infection within the whole animal of the same individuals at a fine temporal scale (daily) and significantly reduced the number of animals used (by 85%) compared with experiments that do not use in vivo techniques. Thus, we present bioluminescent imaging as a novel, non-invasive tool offering great potential to be taken forward into other applications of infectious disease ecology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10cd956ad5fa20ed4248942f77fbd485, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14c7b4062b251282b12993116c72e13d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15d84e88f4d4e4a8938220696c17f74c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2205490698f5d347dfa970d4bdaf3627, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22bbffb0b36211d47e0ec7af53cd5dbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c65848c051a5f387101bbbbf0650f29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31a4dd6ee493686f8eb18ca40856dd28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37c9367b4323718b9947bef1139bc12d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ce1e8d8e032558cd8a7f744bdb9e8ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dc0277d6327b9935d690fa15a5e4764, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41e00a73cdb83978306652dcebd89d76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b95f9c39b2927223f808f4462597934, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/588158be77b112e0284043124621ffba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/599338729bdf6505b62f5b025c1f7b86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b8c291d318504230da48faae95a91a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a5081b53908444a73036b4e99dcf5dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70c673eae0008834fd8d8a4d79019b16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79e20a7ea374bfe0404622ea9f2263cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e293d557a002a7104842989e16687d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/850cb4c3e5a0a19559f29a98b615d1d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b95a14238a39d0a42befe95efc073a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9104ce976bba2d6b128d448451c97f05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c7640ce7848997885b4cc53ed5bc351, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af366e68d191e8ed6bb89b4477b7866b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb4a74b626b8562280f4ddcb90f3d878, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfb4ce4b8ccd8e4c5c0999b933899fdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c59ae41e53706e97646cf50f847e28ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9f3b7c6f29c9034083dc5cfaefabf78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d375cbc445848d0d34a8119eed88c5b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d666d4d6b829446d718e5bf480ff430a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbbd07af608bdf2cf98cea0ca54dce73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc2f29b9f0cbf58207de29668fddc5b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed3640945b32176fe96a1824cd6e0e22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a12b944c76248852d9b71e4c58c646, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f94515e59cb26df9d7f602433665f933"

Environmental tobacco/cigarette smoke (CS) disrupts circadian clock leading to enhanced inflammatory responses. Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) increases hospitalization rates and death in susceptible individuals, including patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We hypothesized that molecular clock disruption is enhanced by IAV infection, altering cellular and lung function, leading to severity in airway disease phenotypes. C57BL/6J mice exposed to chronic CS, BMAL1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were infected with IAV. Following infection, we measured diurnal rhythms of clock gene expression in the lung, locomotor activity, pulmonary function, inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and emphysematous responses. Chronic CS exposure combined with IAV infection altered the timing of clock gene expression and reduced locomotor activity in parallel with increased lung inflammation, disrupted rhythms of pulmonary function, and emphysema. BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV showed pronounced detriments in behavior and survival, and increased lung inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses. This suggests that remodeling of lung clock function following IAV infection alters clock-dependent gene expression and normal rhythms of lung function, enhanced emphysematous and injurious responses. This may have implications for the pathobiology of respiratory virus-induced airway disease severity and exacerbations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0392cf03e943ec18a5f8c220e4c27010, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05c88c40e0c3c109cd4f1bbdd688fbd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cc391c66e86f6e6577841ec4a494bcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cc44ee524dd8cf1d69bb583901b8126, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11192f5158ebb2794d2fe8ff3b07a3a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/230d84756bd070f86eede349713db651, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2995c51fbd493be82faf155b4ff6082f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3398db72f938f975823755d171be1777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3771ba316e92ffd08ae3639d0543f877, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4052c06ba94db46c514194834465a70b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/417dcb50be9a14ed0bfd25a1a9e68913, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42485c4df41be52ef8b4d14b21100af8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/427db673bdb8b138598143be89381964, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4734584a367eb6d98117bc407e73f4dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/478201c0c593add1d9ed937f47b9bb1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48403c70717779aaa0fbcf40c64f27f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4849061a898229468776d6dc1a4e00e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bf804174ed5cf3bcabd1321689ce607, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c77779f4c36474292a4680844199141, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/508921bd094fac1077c53f093656ede1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b4d6164787bdf553af46a1cbc8220f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b5e339842ef492cb72896137de0fd75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bb8b0cf2b2439372c4983b66ff5ccf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/669327a9efb2df707bb892d65fc11266, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688c9196a0d327c40318c2b667a48846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/726175a08204e3b3f1fb31189fb61cec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73cd8efb487bf36d252f67b5d5079b8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76130a900ac34536d2ef155c9b511090, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/763c86c87fda566df6de400e85dd9ccd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ac73787746bb10761da68189ab927da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7af1ec4e7335cc422bec8334b653893a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f50a7322e0dd98f2ab8a2d4ecd57d60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82b73ef43f340a1abaa1d4ab553a291b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/867f5f9278ca2718c444d711b59575c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96cb06ef65dcc8b6aaab7dd04059306b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0f55c1a7e5e4eeefc77f0ef2255b520, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2994d57bd489d649fe5dc555d0fe1e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a880775ab1c98103f920ff2578588629, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9d8b25473c3e04968e5a5c052f357f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7dbdfa545dc1e4c5f71c007af28019a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c5d389e990c9ad96706ebc86ff4dd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6389c886f9a11d1ce60a7e3feea32e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c63a594f2b0dda690a6d48afee6b7616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c67cd42d8df892620984576a5ee07a0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cce155f02b6752339b350d013aa41291, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8825833648d7304ffef017e8f9103d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8e4b8b0678abf8d77d22b748dab8017, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcb05988c7a1a17a39f468f20c0bf8b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9a2a8f6bd91c1962cd7f959a09f32da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb0eb82e0a781a5d582a785ebb0fcda0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f16837829ed6f8ca2e7da93174b53f"

It can affect all age groups of birds. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors that have a key role in immune response and defense against various infections.The TLRs are essential for initiation of innate immune responses and in the development of adaptive immune responses. An in ovo model was employed to study the antiviral activity of TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN) on replication of IBV. It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Further, the mechanism involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral response in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of ECEs was investigated. The ECEs of 9–11 days old were treated with different doses (high, intermediate and low) of TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-21 (CpG ODN) ligands. In addition, to know the timing of TLR ligand treatment, six time intervals were analyzed viz. 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection, time of infection (co-administration of TLR ligands and avian IBV) and 12 and 24 h post-IBV infection. For studying the relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, iNOS and OAS) in CAM, TLR ligands were administered through intra-allantoicroute and CAM were collected at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment. The results demonstrated that intermediate dose of all the three TLR ligands significantly reduced virus titers and used in the present study. However, the LPS reduced virus titer pre- and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced only pre-IBV infection. Further analysis showed that TLR ligands induced IFN-γ, IL-1β and IFN stimulated genes viz. iNOS and OAS genes in CAM. The present study pointed towards the novel opportunities for rational design of LPS as immuno-stimulatory agent in chickens with reference to IBV. It may be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance against viral infection in neonatal chicken and may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/092e6936588959027a15ddf95ed05685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13fea9ae1deed40a6681faa5b261a0ac,

Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae. Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat. Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/054aee3e26e2eb75b13328a527c6e5c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/069c1b3121895550a4495d7f9e71bd8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06a8b1e3192417f5931d585336b8563e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/084cc2b6225d2e35bd7256ad22a30141, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09796d4b555a8e45309af63139feb60e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1095e08a563bad59e5732e996979e6a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13068fdcafeae0990e68579ef1b36a24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13c20ca24e2b493cd9c8e10420947e98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19c33f8c1b26fc0a68816c91f240717d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c1771a3d69b1f537f288839a2dfa542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/212550a300b1b9137a872469cc9e7c35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2219b7dce1dfe251a1214db1649db4a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/251b11113950b0350b4e05bea3ba99de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/255b20cb70f069997a0b1fb97cddf7d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d79289bb51f501cb32c3684c5df5da0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34628ffc3e58a7eea4d23afdd062cccf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3709c524b5387d848e37992b790c0217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40d0dd441d623128ae646e6ce6d3663e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42e184db886e082afa4b6e54b3e1f45a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47695dd0bf4e2678d391b92d1df9fcde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48da5cf97274791797c54fd05f4a465e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ca1cb3427b6c0a21e15bd3de36469ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5062e1cced05a5ec5aedf45ea9e9e7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5117d65c61c78eb1db4ed3d80181f2c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59dcb6abc28303de16b2f6d0d85644cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a83a188e09b9f650e2649e938f8ed2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d8e1fff84c57445f7c5099ce72fa99a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e88962be29738dea99a08c384f29f03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f72a6cb2615fa028767b414cfaa558f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6206b10ea9c4a90dc48f6a9c44a93fb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/677d69452e09c39c3a99f0065955cbe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a704b78b73a71044466d36e31a278e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6aa49d6088e878a7d16d315796a1a96d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bedf99808ae95993af2a89091e95030, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dfff553599d16f89747f1d530e98925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/745e516e53a4cef9875aeb50943a2735, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75996bf90de2187c096d70050c936978, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75fd80e7be557f8c7c8f7b624c1a1543, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ca760f02246d02bbce860be2085b3d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8025b58778e2a3f23f19aae4158f3e65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81ac70f2247d61ee1c8b27418ca0fc2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8945cb69467927518ef57bf50e2d3a14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97837d40bd4a6c252e1b4a7e17b00e76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99cbeb806c46a37024cc7027d64cda1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eadb804493496c87a12a1ac59b25593, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2cbc71eda17230bfa9e954d32d81d1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5f463a46632e88b274b9ad57e3a2e41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afa37ed2c5f9dbabe331198500c0831a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bab8a468d02bb5234462757c1acc359d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdef038d81dc15d3995b29eb9c21d7de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c45972b957e4312125a8f61ec3f01d01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c52a8a2e4238b4ce446842239da00e62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8a5137ddda76e1eaf7704488bd8cc9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce1c4818f71c20a83354f9e8c0047137, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf7c7909f582570c377e3ca74d9867b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc82395b2cf90da9dfa8b62229626dda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df9f09f859d65e4a1eb4327312fa5e62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e481fb3b613264a22ee335efd91b01a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4dc49a8ffc090c30ee1cd45e9d91a3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f860e1550a6c25d1527c302f27d3929e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f96864fac79c281686432966e5d487fb"

Since many virological and immunological data on FECV infections are lacking, the present study investigated these missing links during experimental infection of three SPF cats with FECV strain UCD. Two cats showed mild clinical signs, faecal shedding of infectious virus from 4 dpi, a cell-associated viraemia at inconsistent time points from 5 dpi, a highly neutralising antibody response from 9 dpi, and no major abnormalities in leukocyte numbers. Faecal shedding lasted for 28–56 days, but virus shed during this stage was less infectious in enterocyte cultures and affected by mutations. Remarkably, in the other cat neither clinical signs nor acute shedding were seen, but virus was detected in blood cells from 3 dpi, and shedding of non-enterotropic, mutated viruses suddenly occurred from 14 dpi onwards. Neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi. Leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats, except for the CD8(+) regulatory T cells. These data indicate that FECV can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0122a7f14a4cde3e64b781afdf56b4a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dd397e4ad72f9fb328b6d8f43f8d25e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3032666dba24454893eb9854aa2029d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31bcc628e1d4e64fdb069dc1fdca2fce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/469b9907b3bac026688a983af9cf9e65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b235dcefce5a59bba6465c791704c07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8da2760ceb3b0ac79d09f6603d41d467, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fc08490a73320815f01c6addf991cce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/900c2506ffce414b4e3c1312f9ee0f03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/982ef1203402955206f6d3acf8094abf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ac371ecc9b9b2954889f5b4c45a8d93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acad2e4c23e1ed79919f0a96315a7a80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7989a53bbd51d9300dc12a8a6220129, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9bab84fed16fa5fc5e287a13b82a8f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc895b36c1c73bbf971d96a37aaa960f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf3353eb1b57a77af0affe5bd7a3826f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e57e9eb732cd3c3c27e1d016c5968d29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e72d0732da0e79c34a5f49a1ae95afaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef969b312cdc078ffba407965f52355b"

Among them, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that chronically infects over 90% of the adult population, with over 200,000 cases of cancer and 150,000 cancer-related deaths attributed to it yearly. Acute EBV infection can present as infectious mononucleosis, and lead to the future onset of multiple cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Many of these cancers express latent viral genes, including Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2). Previous attempts to create potent immunogens against EBV have been reported but generated mixed success. We designed novel Synthetic Consensus (SynCon) DNA vaccines against EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 to improve on the immune potency targeting important antigens expressed in latently infected cells. These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers. We optimized the genetic sequences for these three antigens, studied them for expression, and examined their immune profiles in vivo. We observed that these immunogens generated unique profiles based on which antigen was delivered as the vaccine target. EBNA1vax and LMP2Avax generated the most robust T cell immunity. Interestingly, LMP1vax was a very weak immunogen, generating very low levels of CD8 T cell immunity both as a standalone vaccine and as part of a trivalent vaccine cocktail. LMP2Avax was able to drive immunity that impacted EBV-antigen-positive tumor growth. These studies suggest that engineered EBV latent protein vaccines deserve additional study as potential agents for immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1270b1b41c0288122935e751ef647b27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d5ccba186496b5e7359290034aba66a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23af239ec2f3281298337dd880f1000c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a516059b6ed4063c1acd8633b4e2ac0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3109f372839d7052b7bb01ae1325d9b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3320e72902f82695a70a31228fc63a06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36533ac756c9fba4bf35cfbbb0309389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b94e86085ff632213f7118c044691d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ec689923b2fb9c2a8a5dd77aace07f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40248665f0932383663cc1e36a5b9f2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/439a86b2a988dd9ba15963bedb041022, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d6098177fa5917b53d0d15c86c348c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52e0ebe98bcbe6ab6d952c34053d9aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53ba867b5cb58c42e3d545eec2db5136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59fe419922e55b7e9bc66d4e49ac6cce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a9ef0e53bdc249de45ecf83c6dce7b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b1ebfd5d46927d6e0ce921bec416b7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bb6632652f9a2df64de1d9857b9cc78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f891bb9a45f608814fead19b5453a53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6180aee9e09781d952bb95281df03cb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6288f133fe1c1becd3816e65ef930cbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/650ec823928f97a0260a80e0a457b432, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65a3855a84c8cbc5011bb421a2d7758f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690810374a6acb0068931edd0697016a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b669e6365726f611bd1e4c46e1a3dbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dcb70222db6ea3186d7bd6d46de3d31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83add102d15732173ce0f41d15b8b3b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/917f8b68aa850248019b89aed092fef1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9551f154cd7917fa97109da86b3bff3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa7f368ac6549ae0969f125cb5831ed6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab6919f1b45d440032960d9007e873cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0befd8eae17e6509a6495dabec58582, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b92f1ab6b9f23b3e21b1549dd8f35b16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baa2dda33bebdb85905f1616d22114dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2aee248b706482d6662497d4fd1615d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb22961d9a30427c253fd7516af9f359, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd98bc2b27ce2f69a107f49fa0540c69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d62fd76151b671d950f156eee82e2bf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da0a3991e453084db1b7c0289362404d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e65e6a678260e04c44e259c9a251c0a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e679d5bf782df48d527934922f2a9c15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e89da8d7d45567d213b5a021891d15e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecec3103dd55caa4da164b9d0bec1ed2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eed1d1e390bb394db82d8d8057267e55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1ee840070ef29f3a735e24875320adf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2261881f656ab8e7c619537bedc72ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2436c524b7df28eaf0dea5f3869c840, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faa1d5186067a23bb316757e23228d79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fda78e76a2d27893316d69e31e4d08d7"

Since the proposal did not mandate PaO(2)/FiO(2) calculation under standardised ventilator settings (SVS), we hypothesised that a stratification based on baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity. DESIGN: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. SETTING: A network of teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100<PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤200) and severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200<PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤300) ARDS and non-ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)>300). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Group severity and hospital mortality. RESULTS: At ARDS onset, 173 patients had a PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100 but only 38.7% met criteria for severe ARDS at 24 h under SVS. When assessed under SVS, 61.3% of patients with severe ARDS were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS, while lung severity and hospital mortality changed markedly with every PaO(2)/FiO(2) category (p<0.000001). Our model of risk stratification outperformed the stratification using baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) and non-standardised PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 24 h, when analysed by the predictive receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: area under the ROC curve for stratification at baseline was 0.583 (95% CI 0.525 to 0.636), 0.605 (95% CI 0.552 to 0.658) at 24 h without SVS and 0.693 (95% CI 0.645 to 0.742) at 24 h under SVS (p<0.000001).

Apart from horses, S. neurona has been occasionally described causing neurologic disease in several other terrestrial animals as well as mortality in marine mammals. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of a fatal case of S. neurona-associated meningoencephalitis in a domestic cat. The causing agent was analyzed by multilocus genotyping, confirming the presence of S. neurona DNA in the tissue samples of the affected animal. Significant molecular differences were found in relation to S. neurona isolates detected in other regions of the Americas. In addition, the parasite was identical to Sarcocystis sp. identified in opossum sporocysts in Brazil at molecular level, which suggests that transmission of. S. neurona in Brazil might involve variants of the parasite different from those found elsewhere in the Americas. Studies including more samples of S. neurona would be required to test this hypothesis, as well as to assess the impact of this diversity.

However, the etiology of most autoimmune diseases remains unknown. Although genetic linkage studies support a critical underlying role for genetics, the geographic distribution of these disorders as well as the low concordance rates in monozygotic twins suggest that a combination of other factors including environmental ones are involved. Virus infection is a primary factor that has been implicated in the initiation of autoimmune disease. Infection triggers a robust and usually well-coordinated immune response that is critical for viral clearance. However, in some instances, immune regulatory mechanisms may falter, culminating in the breakdown of self-tolerance, resulting in immune-mediated attack directed against both viral and self-antigens. Traditionally, cross-reactive T-cell recognition, known as molecular mimicry, as well as bystander T-cell activation, culminating in epitope spreading, have been the predominant mechanisms elucidated through which infection may culminate in an T-cell-mediated autoimmune response. However, other hypotheses including virus-induced decoy of the immune system also warrant discussion in regard to their potential for triggering autoimmunity. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which virus infection and antiviral immunity contribute to the development of autoimmunity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0501627fd4e600c6ba24fb3434c28872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11af70a66fac8473fa68dc66b84548e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/149a038ac963f4e8d824310a8cdd4369, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19283318d0096f392572ea907e5595fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21139bf4975b6f03ad33cd390ed4ffc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26486f1b28632b73a612972f5345a0bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/372ab927d8099a8f8262caa43e09e1b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cc0963d3822536555de48465caa2f6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6517205813a96ed0e3d871da2e740ad2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6913abdc12946bb82451f38734137b81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6afca05dbe8f26f3ec924ebb7edb1fdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bfd0844afacbdaea4bf8692ac542c10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d30d7e4c951e103b4f309db26c3255f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/740c4bd38fc949f4a9f42ae80007a217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d5049529c52339a0588e5b7498d619e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f59973fe5de92e24eb71159870cf7ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f892b484c6fb06f7aa23dda55305796, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3d13c18bd76bfaaffa53de6f3841ad9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ced27fe22ff1233537ba9384710639, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6154df05f231addd13d0438e998cd81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd6adaf97aa8a3d589e11cd089743257, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0e0b407ecedfec9a8bb45935c54a8b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8666c7defc5fe9439849bb9b9f61eaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d92cf7cdaaef8154c9c69230edc0b494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc2b9d32d3a53fea7fdb915fc250aeaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de165d371c4bc2a50ee625a45165ad0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e19689210fb376517931d6d5fb739835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4f46515d5bf2f8fc2b61bba7751d9b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed5f7cba751fc047fd13ce934abae83f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3e86219dfe10d194e65447113ca3fab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6c6c982723071f57c83cf6f39d91c4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9604e634740a7f9fff95d367c1e5787"

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h postpartum, with and without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to treatments: colostrum suckled (S, n=8); S plus fat supplement (SF, n=5); bottle-fed milk replacer (B, n=8); or B plus fat supplement (BF, n=7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs were taken with a cytology brush, immersed in ultrapure water to burst cells, and lipids extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts and milk collected from sows at 24 h were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids highly distinguished [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9] between S and B gilts, including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbon and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE(34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r> 0.6;p< 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids more abundant in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum, with 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p< 0.001), respectively, of B versus S gilts.

Overall, the adaptive immune response to PRRS virus (PRRSV) is weak, which results in delayed elimination of virus from the host and inferior vaccine protection. PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response. To test this, we measured both antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs after the administration of a nonreplicating human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing porcine IFN-α (Ad5–pIFN-α) at the time of PRRSV infection and compared the results to those for pigs infected with PRRSV alone. Viremia was delayed, and there was a decrease in viral load in the sera of pigs administered the Ad5–pIFN-α. Although seroconversion was slightly delayed in pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, probably due to the early reduction in viral replication, little difference in the overall or neutralizing antibody response was seen. However, there was an increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells detected in the pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, as well as an altered cytokine profile in the lung at 14 days postinfection, indicating that the presence of IFN-α at the time of infection can alter innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2113686151a50c0f90a35fcf466c03ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/550b55fdea26048ee4b07d5cb6c820f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c3fa27ce32dc92766e294e30d6daef6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ce3e9ab6c50796234bcf8ef1d0b068d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e644a3b37c38908f715d2a4f038ad480"

VEEV is highly infectious in aerosol form and has been weaponized in the past making it a potential biothreat agent. At present, there are no FDA approved antiviral treatments or vaccines for VEEV. Artificial microRNAs are small molecules which are expressed through endogenous microRNA machinery by RNA polymerase II. These artificial microRNAs effectively inhibit gene expression and are non-toxic to the host cell. VEEV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to VEEV replication. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeted inhibition of VEEV RdRp using artificial microRNAs may efficiently inhibit VEEV replication. Five artificial microRNAs were tested in vitro in BHK cells. Three of these artificial miRNAs showed significant inhibition of VEEV replication. Further, these microRNAs were cloned into the expression vector in combination to see the synergistic effect on VEEV replication. Combination of more than one miRNA did not result in significant inhibition of virus replication. In conclusion, we have shown that RNAi through artificial microRNAs effectively inhibits VEEV replication and is significantly less toxic in comparison to siRNAs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14218c59f366a99f14e7965bccbc09bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d5dd8bd728535328220abcbe9166f4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21204728b86eb23869b25fcf19b00685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ae3b6481175185ef2aa67366958579f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ecc19e5a8c7008657f04106e8e457eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56e2e1dbfef7ded66d651eb86f8e6eec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5caa219c9cfb643550a25f473d1d889a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69d496c4cbf6e40ba4f34dac90bba91b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c0a96790d51e73f6d72d4c7ffc471d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fc97d3c555bb8aa0aa50e3a179ece65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74f5120c1d2a7ce1f756c9e6422249d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78e9380f02c2cc1a17af4541369c82b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8348eacb293291c178201f5576f1972e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/861ecadfe8f105d12e8a542c37fcaa4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/887a0d46c2f9ba64cb4bd098cc07546c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e7fbbeb294afcfa1c268d12360a9b0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9248859d713ebfa0f5a2f45c39b93365, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a541d23b1dd48326bea6f3871abd72bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a54eab1140fa6905439ab609be2a5a67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c03b86b5e34c930b6d06e07288e46f3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0c7fc358855092face4c8aa933f5a13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3406d0508d91de43585cc08234bc13c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1f0f77ce317b6659c261123af546627, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3030f1deb387ef8678dde3b4b3bb45f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4442f831fdd7d7fdab5f79a04697191, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f98931fcf6353bcb5db896e16940f7ba"

Additionally, B. bronchiseptica is capable of establishing long-term or chronic infections in swine. Bacterial biofilms are increasingly recognized as important contributors to chronic bacterial infections. Recently the polysaccharide locus bpsABCD has been demonstrated to serve a critical role in the development of mature biofilms formed by the sequenced laboratory strain of B. bronchiseptica. We hypothesized that swine isolates would also have the ability to form mature biofilms and the bpsABCD locus would serve a key role in this process. A mutant containing an in-frame deletion of the bpsABCD structural genes was constructed in a wild-type swine isolate and found to be negative for poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG)-like material by immunoblot assay. Further, the bpsABCD locus was found to be required for the development and maintenance of the three-dimensional structures under continuous-flow conditions. To investigate the contribution of the bpsABCD locus to the pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, the KM22Δbps mutant was compared to the wild-type swine isolate for the ability to colonize and cause disease in pigs. The bpsABCD locus was found to not be required for persistence in the upper respiratory tract of swine. Additionally, the bpsABCD locus did not affect the development of anti-Bordetella humoral immunity, did not contribute to disease severity, and did not mediate protection from complement-mediated killing. However, the bpsABCD locus was found to enhance survival in the lower respiratory tract of swine.",""

This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations. RESULTS: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. CONCLUSION: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified. The analyses are also important preludes to establishing research hypotheses for more focused studies.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2350b59b92953d73dc46dd0d9958f6c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f47e2b755540e9d9f9e9795d627c26b1"

However, axonal degeneration can be beneficial in the case of infection with neurotropic viruses that spread in the CNS using axonal transport. C57BL/Wld(S) (Wld(S), Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) mice are protected from axonal degeneration. Wld(S) mice infected with the neurovirulent GDVII strain of TMEV are more resistant to virus infection than wild-type mice, suggesting that axonal preservation contributes to the resistance. By contrast, infection with the less virulent Daniels strain of TMEV results in high levels of virus propagation in the CNS, suggesting that prolonged survival of axons in Wld(S) mice favors virus spread. Thus, axonal degeneration might be a beneficial self-destruct mechanism that limits the spread of neurotropic viruses, in the case of less virulent virus infection. We hypothesize that neurons use ‘built-in’ self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site. Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication. Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus. Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses. Thus, the balance between neurodegeneration and virus propagation may be taken into account in the future design of neuroprotective therapy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0365bd90944e941d07bb47c11ca822c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/106ff0b2684dd6918670fd095476a279, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15980905a46969a380fe10aa461d83f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c33d9a61f3f6601ea61bf3e4ce21649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c95b6736eac546a4ef1f7ac88880140, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d793f0dbe8bb25bd8cc8a02f76b1389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20936acc22a95f0c3790dd2bdc82cf4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/294fda819a9c93feab46e7dedead1824, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aa8c0eb2d051904147442a3de1855c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2de51bfae6c526e8721fc8552fe0dc9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32a3168c3b7dbbb44763e998989fd5dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/331949a8b11ce16e84bbd47e0f8a7e19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36c2f14aada5c97ae1b6683cecd0217b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/376cc7e98b1c03bccb0dd912651d3053, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a92853185836998e837e6c6412d844d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bbfea8a930ff5e9b8c0177e9424f74a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fa54c13d8940a9f386ae66e5ce7a1d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43374a37a0bc1f57a41d309c249aca28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4367009ea42e5dde34071d3c305e2bc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46e64d61f5cfb070dd72a82cf18a8b20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49590a50cb02e99a23c61d7287b50e0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4efa6718556bbf94646b8361cd84dc5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5485a0284e8d1e25db76868bbd30b6c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59503941076f67514a4c8e71ff01fb93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e8765a781f5fd1c9aaee2662250c2e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5efe02926d3a50e36a9ff757a85f919c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60f64b288a2a87455d16971815fb2a3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/645dd57fcb6659b02f6603e2a6b94077, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69d8d6a0c3b78ddaa6fd7ebd0f14c15c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c83aaa370633a3ea6a3cfb7c7b9399f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/713792f323590f6072930505fea51c49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73444872d9e48d77cc04d7984ceeb191, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7965fd5ad8c1a684a7a2d556b19ae3ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/841ad7c95ce221a6d4aef11d3763ae8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86d929c76e9be1364123f14414cfacf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/875c98a65432b4d0238fd923d0ff7641, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d053779bf237e63e8c2192733a8592d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97c5daacef57cfcbea025834e8c3968e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98114608c142c2f354a0dfdc7ab8d173, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a15de8564956a37c87e8f624a572afd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6dadba9291bedecc784c9272d1bba2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b77420021062fde5abc57d6304cb9c7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c038a9ad3d0cba042d730dde3f0fbe86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c21e6a6650b0cf9e713f957af6517c28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4b8684c2a865ce687e47fd2223095bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc20d7fe81a442fa532122cb64950df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc98ecf791051db8519f2f8328a4c4ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccb03d539515a084ed54fbb33e9361a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d181d8710623850889249d3319bbd912, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcfc20d2b9197ef0ed633b9e92072e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7ea950e1ddb848c5a6f3d90115227ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e942c256ac8e7301c70ededa39354a59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebe34fc5881701a7ccebd8ff8839420e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef4981d117fbbc2ec8e0f73d5424091c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffb011cd0bd467bea9777f4963ecebb7"

Such a ‘fast-forward’ evolution enables viruses to rapidly adapt to new host species, evade host immune responses, and to develop resistance to anti-viral drugs. Similarly, rapid evolution allows viruses to attain new levels of virulence, defined as the ability to cause severe disease in hosts. We hypothesize that distinct viral groups share genetic determinants that modulate virulence that have been acquired through convergent evolution. Thus, common patterns reflecting changing virulence-related specific viral groups could be detected. The main goals for this project are (1) to understand how genetic and phenotypic diversity can be generated among different viral groups by analyzing the variation patterns and determining the selective forces behind them (impact in viral fitness) and (2) to understand how fixed mutations can modulate virulence within different viral groups by performing comparison of strains with differing virulence within a longitudinal timescale. The subject of the study is key emerging and re-emerging virus families of medical importance. Such groups include: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronaviruses), Picornaviridae (Hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (Yellow fever, West Nile, Hepatitis C, Dengue, and Zika viruses), Togaviridae (Rubella and Chikungunya virus), Bornaviridae (Borna-disease virus), Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses), Paramyxoviridae (Measles, Nipah, and Hendra viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Lyssaviruses), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Bunyaviridae (Hanta- and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses), and Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A viruses). Viral genomes collected at different time points, different hosts (human and their most closely related animal reservoirs) and different locations will be compiled. Extensive molecular evolutionary analyses will be carried out to infer gene expansion/contraction within groups, rates of evolution, and changes in selection pressure, including the detection of positive selected genes and sites (adaptive evolution). Positively selected sites will be mapped onto the viral protein structures to reveal their impact on function, and hence the location of potential virulence determinants. Virulence changes among particular viral strains and types will be defined and measured according to definitions based on an increase in: (1) transmissibility, (2) host tropism, (3) immune evasion, (4) morbidity and mortality, (5) drug resistance, and by the incorporation of epidemiological data to determine whether high or low virulence strains within different hosts and localities are spreading most efficiently in nature.",""

Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/352cb12cc8ce678cd01c89a2a7ee95f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3670336cb8c4faffe85e580252e98694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/586326d8d95e328a0bab17dd56cda1d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65a1604e840e9cba68721a759fcf4bac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f5d861a431f3678e5a681dad85d965e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aae8696f434aea934a47ee7d6198d3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0a336dd63591a835d52c5b1b204be7b"

All samples from the non-FIP cats and 25.26% of the samples from the FIP cats were positive for the FCoV membrane (M) gene. Mutations in this gene consisted of SNP changes randomly scattered among the sequences; few mutations resulted in amino acid changes. No geographic pattern was observed. Of the cats without FIP that harboured FECoV, the amino acid sequence identities for the M gene were 100% among cats (Cats 1–3) from the same cattery, and the overall sequence identity for the M gene was ≥91%. In one cat, two different lineages of FCoV, one enteric and one systemic, were found that segregated apart in the M gene tree. In conclusion, the in vivo mutation transition hypothesis and the circulating high virulent-low virulent FCoV hypothesis have been found to be plausible according to the results obtained from sequencing the M gene.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0632f31c09bacda6475e31bc1392320f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09077bbe99e2f66f3122c20747a6b4c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c2a20dd9b6398c786f6e66d86e733db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fb0be9b031440c5d1a69e4fa81cb555, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ccbe7c2214cf525df3ffa708f7fbe06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f274a397c080781139a051a31e24a54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/214d3af61a47fd8dbc4b2ceb7dc6b2ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e65cab31c27fd70fc0c7323b890c5e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32c60772e6d576c271716bd726f9687f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cd3baf8bac27ea1ad8b71028c56bd50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f72e9c4c1c0fe022c7edb544e59310f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fc78f14f7d761954d0738386f9c783e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a1b46e05c4f6141782c102614cd2d4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ee70dd744cd19133dcfa950691e9e91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f7ad6b3d6631c61ee6aa16cc9fb53da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/717c1cfe9f4f87133b59b0919c4f11bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7abbc8d56fb380c6585e28d974472616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f95af962822b3271b0e44c5fa56981d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83049716710c1a922801b0f7d9cdee3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8488d0d4563c109a51afd638db1310ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/886d5a3dacf8619e86340f96095c16bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cf45359f6ad3e07a96a83c6ad2b148d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e8035057427990f27757868eb2787eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a00f194b8b601ed18eaaf38e23cec00b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2a364745e46b1e9c83105214db6be69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfd2c3a3694ce18cd3e0bac4b56f07c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0ef5127ddf50a5e625e3eb490851cbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c69a0b0310d98721d2c59a310b48771e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca9f0afdad7d27f4c65ba094dc64511b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cca68c186ca6e2248afcb2abb3bfdd76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8316a76354e2c1c1d5dd1c332fb6165, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de535006c9988b45a2d38c166b1b0111, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4efdf109662c6c91d33ca32663e82ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffe8f288a41b59768020eb1313a81917"

Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.

Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Conclusion: Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19.

We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation. VIDEO ABSTRACT:",""

Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimens. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks. Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses. The possibilities of using experimental evolution to understand virus behavior are still largely unexploited.",""

The efficiency of frameshifting varies widely for different sites, but the factors that determine frameshifting efficiency are not yet fully understood. Previous work has suggested that frameshifting efficiency is related to the resistance of the pseudoknot against mechanical unfolding. We tested this hypothesis by studying the mechanical properties of a panel of pseudoknots with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 2% to 30%: four pseudoknots from retroviruses, two from luteoviruses, one from a coronavirus, and a nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Using optical tweezers to apply tension across the RNA, we measured the distribution of forces required to unfold each pseudoknot. We found that neither the average unfolding force, nor the unfolding kinetics, nor the parameters describing the energy landscape for mechanical unfolding of the pseudoknot (energy barrier height and distance to the transition state) could be correlated to frameshifting efficiency. These results indicate that the resistance of pseudoknots to mechanical unfolding is not a primary determinant of frameshifting efficiency. However, increased frameshifting efficiency was correlated with an increased tendency to form alternate, incompletely folded structures, suggesting a more complex picture of the role of the pseudoknot involving the conformational dynamics.",""

We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols. To investigate the quantity and size of aerosols emitted when the instrument is played, eight healthy volunteers were asked to blow a vuvuzela. For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 658×10(3) per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.7×10(3) per litre for shouting, representing a mean log(10) difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p<0.001). The majority (>97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons. Further investigation is required to assess the potential of the vuvuzela to contribute to the transmission of aerosol borne diseases. We recommend, as a precautionary measure, that people with respiratory infections should be advised not to blow their vuvuzela in enclosed spaces and where there is a risk of infecting others.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/046bc733c8b4bd84779dfd0be6f60e46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d94799c5f391240dc7dfdb2a47406e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b2122199c737e5b52f921a7f1ae1361, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48ab7108c47a9f386d8c4f59c2250002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55089dee4633e7395189409ed1e0199f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/560656760a2226c24eb423941d7dce10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60a624707de08634af669a857f87d172, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/657642f18b4e5e70d7c14c575c3403e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6792ee5cb33a26a2dd8cdace05eb1e26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82c44f0be9f58dce84605e71f37226c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b46a689dd1abc0ad5e9376dbecb4307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/921f300669a94ba7f31960a98d423d8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ba7cdbd9986b98ac2bc47f8df7a8a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7b64d12e8f10f08cc30d2d4f9f2c5a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab43779f70085af9b54ba77395bdd816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac910b92c86e6a525cd2812024b5c040, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afbbb3375163e3ba439239727a67da48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c40928b8d9210682586a0466d32bd7c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d882365de10f4debc8bed42597c15ea6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db5f294cecbfa03807b55b25acb6085b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0bbc90f4e8242b5dfdae2db423755bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e57be3a55bad715c77991c19b28cfb5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed9d0d3604c5141363a3fd55166a92f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd4d716c19948b98bd2285e3d5e88770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff984d0fd8bfa059665bca43b7ea3fe1"

It is usually a self-limiting disease; however, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), which cause up to two-thirds of colds, have temperature-dependent replication and most HRV strains replicate optimally at 33°C. Delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways has the potential to reduce viral replication, but evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment of the common cold is inconclusive. We plan to test the hypothesis that delivery of humidified air heated to 41°C at high flow, nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF), for 2 hours daily for five days is more effective in reducing common cold symptom severity and duration than five days of ‘sham’ rhinothermy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, single-blind, parallel-group trial comparing rNHF to ‘sham’ rhinothermy in the treatment of common cold. We plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms of common cold and randomise them 1:1 to receive one of the two treatments for five days. The study duration is 14 days, which includes clinic visits on the first day of randomisation and four days post-randomisation, and a phone call on the 14th day. Participants will complete daily symptom diaries which include a symptom score, the Modified Jackson Score (MJS). The primary outcome is the MJS after four days.

To date, no effective treatments exist and current prophylactic therapy access is limited and is only ∼50% effective. To attenuate the risk of RSV infection, we hypothesized that bioengineering of either the virus particle or host cell via the covalent grafting of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) [mPEG] would prevent infection. To this end, the anti-viral effects of grafting concentration, linker chemistry and polymer length on RSV infection was assessed. For viral modification, short chain polymers (2kDa) were significantly more effective than long chain (20kDa) polymers. In contrast, modification of host cells with small polymers provided no (∼0%) protection while long chain polymers effectively prevented infection. For example, at 48hours post-infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 and grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 15mm, 20kDa mPEG decreased infection by 45, 83, and 91%, respectively. Importantly, both viral and host cell PEGylation strategies were able to provide near complete protection against RSV infection of both non-polarized and polarized cells. In conclusion, mPEG-modification of either RSV or the host cell is a highly effective prophylactic strategy for preventing viral infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13b0447bd958a7d77cdc2cbc8054639b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22d3bde354350a817796f4c95fef7541, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b762a0ad8fe22181b560ebaf7ff51ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bbedf9bcf38f39be845d65f2368c69d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42abdb9a93b2540ba5a6ffb62e12b9e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46ea915169b88a4a18cbee209f9f8b5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4916189bc6e7a3a5820bd5f59eaab5e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b2aa9a72e4ead4de16ce5de088c1294, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e3ed63e1f7ba6d17de0cc8ca2794a68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5067dd4ce2952bf9f84c63b611e94120, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/531ed50f0b6ce08bd750f13113d6e4e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55f26997f4b3581099f5ab4a08b1703d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/630de2371ee25a5eb3e17f630811f493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6605f4bd863ee36d48f8b09f975234d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66eeb24f572976e8d0a75c869d76d9a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67972e289d5820f9763cfbeb7d28bc36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a3d2143313a5f7f9e54fe2b8d129b2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f20f2919dd883e883dfac72affa3299, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78972251820f08380abd84f18176d451, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84a6019b9992613499d6f7901225ce85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/923b0de4c37b506ca0124fe4f79212ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/965d92e7629bc72fe7dd4983e5b51fa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a30db9a693e8b5b317687e4df478bbab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5e250cb27249e46a1e04224cc0c2184, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0eedc77ba804eea06af7178a5d52f2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c13ee4c43378aeb49cb0109d74af3949, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc3423d3a501bb5545b83f721017dbd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc7db3bd73f16bacb0d77674b09c9049, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d49a7b74fb485c35a66fd675583a440a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da29f17774b3668c3ddf1c47d93ea06c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddf43653c206689f2c7f4bc9a770a758, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa6fb3270845cbec22c86b4999d719f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc2a12f30a44f917708b4aa8a47d8527"

Diapause is a primary adaptation to environmental heterogeneity, and in D. melanogaster the propensity to enter diapause varies predictably with latitude and season. Here we performed global transcriptomic profiling of naturally occurring variation in diapause expression elicited by short day photoperiod and moderately low temperature in two tissue types associated with neuroendocrine and endocrine signaling, heads, and ovaries. We show that diapause in D. melanogaster is an actively regulated phenotype at the transcriptional level, suggesting that diapause is not a simple physiological or reproductive quiescence. Differentially expressed genes and pathways are highly distinct in heads and ovaries, demonstrating that the diapause response is not uniform throughout the soma and suggesting that it may be comprised of functional modules associated with specific tissues. Genes downregulated in heads of diapausing flies are significantly enriched for clinally varying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and seasonally oscillating SNPs, consistent with the hypothesis that diapause is a driving phenotype of climatic adaptation. We also show that chromosome location-based coregulation of gene expression is present in the transcriptional regulation of diapause. Taken together, these results demonstrate that diapause is a complex phenotype actively regulated in multiple tissues, and support the hypothesis that natural variation in diapause propensity underlies adaptation to spatially and temporally varying selective pressures.",""

Therefore, it is potentially one of the most important vehicles for promoting peace among the peoples of the world. Although previous South Korean governments have historically proposed a variety of actions to contribute to peace on the Korean Peninsula, there has been little success. However, the Mt. Gumgang tourism development, the hallmark of the Sunshine Policy of former president of South Korea, Dae Jung Kim, is different from previous tourism initiatives as it has had more tangible and practical outcomes that have contributed to the promotion of peace on the divided Peninsula. To this end, the South Korean government has applied the insights of neofunctionalism to the Mt. Gumgang tourism development. This is an approach to integration theory from the perspective of liberalism that has been heralded in international politics. According to this approach, it is expected that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development can be used as a tool to maintain peaceful circumstances, which results in spill-over effects, enlargement of activity scopes, and a heightened level of commitment on the Korean Peninsula. The purpose of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that the Mt. Gumgang tourism development contributes to the peace of the Korean Peninsula by employing the theory of neofunctionalism. To test this hypothesis, this study proposes a Peace Index and investigates the spill-over effects by utilizing the Mt. Gumgang tourism development as a test case. The results of this study indicate that the view that tourism contributes to peace is valid but tenuous since the impact of the Mt. Gumgang tourism development in the promotion of peace was less significant than expected. Consequently, the results of this study also indicate that neofunctionalism, which has been developed for western political systems, needs to be re-examined when applied to the unique, dynamic, and complex political circumstances on the Korean Peninsula.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb1b2ca5190abda94087aef6aa53cb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2df05607ac43ea5d4e7719d0cf1b6820, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f71f6bcb605e674ed1137074b482617, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4395e6017e33421f8b8ef22a6328a14e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c9e123e25af404a622a2dd21778c9c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a20fb229f175373b1277862568768cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ae5ba2de5164fe5edb3c50a28d55f88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/742d22263ac448d86574f3843867d70d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/751ca57878dc96ebbcb82272406e45f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3ec0cfd1201b098b0e3c5529d51496b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abc3c1343b06bf919f5d1f4717e566ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b55475df2762e0e2b1cdd310fa976971, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba518a6eed73b2070cd7224b306d1cb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1feef4efb701abe87375592a4df525e"

Analysis of the S1 gene showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 was a tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus, with a nucleotide sequence similarity of 99%. However, a complete genomic sequence analysis showed that ck/CH/LGX/130530 was more closely related to a Massachusetts type strain (95% similarity to strain H120) than to the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (86%), suggesting that recombination might have occurred during the origin of the virus. A SimPlot analysis of the complete genomic sequence confirmed this hypothesis, and it showed that isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 emerged from a recombination event between parental IBV H120 strain and pathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03-like virus. The results obtained from the pairwise comparison and nucleotide similarity showed that the recombination breakpoint was located in the nsp14 gene at nucleotides 17055–17083. In line with the high S1 gene sequence similarity, the ck/CH/LGX/130530 isolate was serotypically close to that of the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain (73% antigenic relatedness). Furthermore, vaccination with the LDT3-A vaccine, which was derived from the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain by serial passaging in chicken eggs, provided good protection against challenge with the tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, in contrast to the poor protection offered with the H120 vaccine. Interestingly, isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 exhibited low pathogenicity toward specific-pathogen-free chickens compared with the nephropathogenic tl/CH/LDT3/03 strain, which was likely due to natural recombination in the 5′ 17-kb region of the genome. Our results also indicate that the replicase gene of IBV isolate ck/CH/LGX/130530 is associated with viral pathogenicity.",""

Here we designed a dynamic transmission model to analyze the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea based on confirmed cases reported during the period May 20–July 4, 2015. Our model explicitly incorporates superspreading events and time-dependent transmission and isolation rates. Our model was able to provide a good fit to the trajectory of the outbreak and was useful to analyze the role of hypothetical control scenarios. Specifically, we assessed the impact of the timing of control measures, especially associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic delays on outbreak size and duration. Early interventions within 1week after the epidemic onset, for instance, including the initial government announcement to the public about the list of hospitals exposed to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), show a promising means to reduce the size ( > 71 % ) and duration ( > 35 % ) of the MERS epidemic.

Some of these TLR4 polymorphisms are racially specific. We hypothesised that feline TLR4 polymorphisms might underlie an observed increased risk to infectious and inflammatory diseases in some cat breeds. The aim of this study was to identify breed-specific variations in the coding region of feline TLR4 and to model the effect of mutations on protein structure and function in silico. The entire coding region of TLR4 was sequenced in 8 groups (7 pure-bred, 1 crossbred) of domestic cats (Felis catus) comprising 158 individuals. Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in TLR4, with 16 located in the coding region (11 non-synonymous) and four in the 3′UTR. Comparison of breed specific allelic frequencies indicated that Burmese and British shorthairs most commonly differed from other breeds. In silico analyses to predict the impact of the 11 non-synonymous variants indicated a deleterious effect on protein structure for one SNP (c.869 G > A), which was not associated with a specific breed. Overall, findings from this study do not support a role of TLR4 dysfunction in breed-predispositions to infectious diseases in domestic cats in Australia.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c07d23cd2c2d5b36c2bd48c7548cab7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f01c7496563b0a9fa182ea71e2523cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12c22f75378ab84c64348bb0a2dc1d0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1425392f36058622d213e2ba15469c32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/143e10216a076b8f6adc9d813b4be1ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aa7f5a8050d168df755b60c0a4cb2c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1abb76eb310ccd26e25ffcb5130045c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fa45b79a777650ed098fa973ef59cc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27cc2572e8c1c7e9fc1cc943dee7def3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/365d823365d55f22cf1488406f6d4903, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e4dd4d8e20a7c952085be6958c34ef5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f84e6351ecd97eeed0af869b6ccf3e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/508ff024ead61b51a5ddcf492cb66712, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50d05829d95d31eec8cd50c51bf2a29e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/550ce9d6de15b58d5375899401151cd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55bff21bfe11145276ace8f43ef7bc22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ba663a57a8af100828771b0a64741cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7365bbad5cf6cc0b785418c5fc179ca4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73bebe6abaf024e600a0bd781a395bf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81f0c4db0d58ecfcaadfdb9ab862b4fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83b997213260a0bcc854d471de6c5ab6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84ebf451645240596bb55ceab9c4e109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88c1d0a50e1176d4b6316b3b70a1529e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/912a75758434f193a48689b891f85e40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2b29d36e452c9821ffa65c52cf22fda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa516908d278945f6ca9e9cf52bc1f73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab2cfe5da5e2c239879f570837641353, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afcf21ab8c9e12a92b4dde0866ac8d0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7b1eca64400d7abeae5dcb9d2d44cfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c298a99575db276a662ac61986f32b0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbbf7092117ef8b5f3e80fbdbddfe389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da4e8f7f9c27803313829b958ae16924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e12763bdde6d01516ab45796b10c5e42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e610c7ece380030f85993e69e7702ab7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e63e57be7b521022eb2219b3ff12713f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea2cdc21d0ef0e6d407de436492aad00"

In vitro frameshift assays were performed on retroviral gag-pro frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots and their derivatives, a pseudoknot from the gene 32 mRNA of bacteriophage T2 that is not naturally associated with frameshifting, and hybrids of these pseudoknots. Results show that the gag-pro pseudoknot from human endogenous retrovirus-K10 (HERV) stimulates a -1 frameshift with an efficiency similar to that of the closely related retrovirus MMTV. The bacteriophage T2 mRNA pseudoknot was found to be a poor stimulator of frameshifting, supporting a hypothesis that the retroviral pseudoknots have distinctive properties that make them efficient frameshift stimulators. A hybrid, designed by combining features of the bacteriophage and retroviral pseudoknots, was found to stimulate frameshifting while retaining significant structural similarity to the nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot. Mutational analyses of the retroviral and hybrid pseudoknots were used to evaluate the effects of an unpaired (wedged) adenosine at the junction of the pseudoknot stems, changing the base pairs near the junction of the two stems, and changing the identity of the loop 2 nucleotide nearest the junction of the stems. Pseudoknots both with and without the wedged adenosine can stimulate frameshifting, though the identities of the nucleotides near the stem1/stem2 junction do influence efficiency. NMR data showed that the bacteriophage and hybrid pseudoknots are similar in their local structure at the junction of the stems, indicating that pseudoknots that are similar in this structural feature can differ radically in their ability to stimulate frameshifting. NMR methods were used to compare the internal motions of the bacteriophage T2 pseudoknot and representative frameshifting pseudoknots. The stems of the investigated pseudoknots are similarly well ordered on the time scales to which nitrogen-15 relaxation data are sensitive; however, solvent exchange rates for protons at the junction of the two stems of the nonframeshifting bacteriophage pseudoknot are significantly slower than the analogous protons in the representative frameshifting pseudoknots.",""

Of the viral structural proteins, the N protein plays a pivot role in assembly process of viral particles as well as viral replication and transcription. The SARS-CoV N proteins expressed in the eukaryotes, such as yeast and HEK293 cells, appeared in the multiple spots on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE), whereas the proteins expressed in E. coli showed a single 2DE spot. These 2DE spots were further examined by Western blot and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, and identified as the N proteins with differently apparent pI values and similar molecular mass of 50kDa. In the light of the observations and other evidences, a hypothesis was postulated that the SARS-CoV N protein could be phosphorylated in eukaryotes. To locate the plausible regions of phosphorylation in the N protein, two truncated N proteins were generated in E. coli and treated with PKCα. The two truncated N proteins after incubation of PKCα exhibited the differently electrophoretic behaviors on 2DE, suggesting that the region of 1–256 aa in the N protein was the possible target for PKCα phosphorylation. Moreover, the SARS-CoV N protein expressed in yeast were partially digested with trypsin and carefully analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. In contrast to the completely tryptic digestion, these partially digested fragments generated two new peptide mass signals with neutral loss, and MS/MS analysis revealed two phosphorylated peptides located at the “dense serine” island in the N protein with amino acid sequences, GFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSSR and GNSGNSTPGSSRGNSPARMASGGGK. With the PKCα phosphorylation treatment and the partially tryptic digestion, the N protein expressed in E. coli released the same peptides as observed in yeast cells. Thus, this investigation provided the preliminary data to determine the phosphorylation sites in the SARS-CoV N protein, and partially clarified the argument regarding the phosphorylation possibility of the N protein during the infection process of SARS-CoV to human host.",""

Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II. An “alternate” arm of the RAS now exists in which ACE2 counterbalances the effects of the classic RAS through degradation of Ang II, and generation of the vasodilator Ang 1-7. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. The catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding, resulting in ACE2 in the circulation. The ACE2 gene maps to a quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome in three strains of genetically hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACE2 may be a candidate gene for hypertension. It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension. Experimental hypertension studies have measured ACE2 in either the heart or kidney and/or plasma, and have reported that deletion or inhibition of ACE2 leads to hypertension, whilst enhancing ACE2 protects against the development of hypertension, hence increasing ACE2 may be a therapeutic option for the management of high blood pressure in man. There have been relatively few studies of ACE2, either at the gene or the circulating level in patients with hypertension. Plasma ACE2 activity is low in healthy subjects, but elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease. Genetic studies have investigated ACE2 gene polymorphisms with either hypertension or blood pressure, and have produced largely inconsistent findings. This review discusses the evidence regarding ACE2 in experimental hypertension models and the association between circulating ACE2 activity and ACE2 polymorphisms with blood pressure and arterial hypertension in man.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00cc50043e90ad394f728bad4220b0a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0293e5f8ae279272f721948e4d7c0e8c,

The hypothesis was that in vitro stimulation of RPE cells with Aβ(1-40), a constituent of drusen, promotes changes in gene expression and cellular pathways associated with the pathogenesis of AMD, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis. METHODS: Confluent human RPE cells were stimulated with Aβ(1-40), or the reverse peptide Aβ(40-1), and genome wide changes in gene expression were studied with gene microarrays. Selected genes were verified by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Pathway analysis with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and ingenuity revealed top functional pathways in RPE after Aβ(1-40) stimulation. RESULTS: RPE cells stimulated with Aβ(1-40) (0.3 μM) for 24 hours resulted in 63 upregulated and 22 downregulated previously known genes. The upregulated genes were predominantly in inflammatory and immune response categories, but other categories were also represented, including apoptosis, cell signaling, cell proliferation, and signal transduction. Categories of downregulated genes included immune response, transporters, metabolic functions and transcription factors. ELISA confirmed that secreted levels of IL-8 were two times higher than control levels. GSEA and ingenuity analysis confirmed that the top affected pathways in RPE cells after Aβ(1-40) stimulation were inflammation and immune response related. Surprisingly, few angiogenic pathways were activated at the doses and exposure times studied. CONCLUSIONS: Aβ(1-40) promotes RPE gene expression changes in pathways associated with immune response, inflammation, and cytokine and interferon signaling pathways. Results may relate to in vivo mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of AMD.",""

Data presented here show that the skin test responses (Arthus and delayed type) of BCG-vaccinated mice do not correlate with the suppression of sporozoite immunity. Evidence is also presented to support the hypothesis that the abrogated immune response to sporozoite vaccination induced by BCG is a result of a loss of immunological memory.",""

DESIGN: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011. METHODS: Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of two million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting. This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk. RESULTS: 65 outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the serial interval to be 1.86 days (95% CI 1.6 to 2.2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was not significant (p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22ce16ff06ff8e08c3a8004074b4ae41"

This entity was named MERS for’ Middle East respiratory syndrome’. By January 9, 2014, the disease had already struck 178 persons of whom 75 died from respiratory failure and diarrhoea. As the new disease was very similar to the deadly SARS (2002–2003) and since it was provoked by a Betacoronavirus, chiroptera were first suspected to be at the origin of this infection. Morever, recent studies performed in Saudi Arabia showed that one individual of the bat Taphozous perforatus harbored a short nucleotide segment identical to the homologous segment present in the viral strain isolated from the index-case of the epidemic. In addition, many strains of Betacoronavirus more or less related to those responsible for the MERS disease in man have been isolated from bats in Africa, Asia and Europe. However, another hypothesis was simultaneously proposed incriminating dromedary (Camelus dromedarius L.) as a likely actor in the transmission to human beings of the disease.We then reviewed data relative to other viral zoonosis in which dromedary was possibly implicated. This led to the provisional conclusion that this large mammal might play a role in the dissemination of the MERS-COV, the etiologic agent of the disease. This is based on epidemiological data and results of several serological surveys in animals.",""

More recent studies showed that angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which degrades ANGII to form ANG1–7, is protective but severely downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. Here it was theorized that ACE-2 and its product ANG1–7 might therefore regulate AEC apoptosis. To evaluate this hypothesis, the AEC cell line MLE-12 and primary cultures of rat AECs were exposed to the profibrotic apoptosis inducers ANGII or bleomycin (Bleo). Markers of apoptosis (caspase-9 or -3 activation and nuclear fragmentation), steady-state ANGII and ANG1–7, and JNK phosphorylation were measured thereafter. In the absence of Bleo, inhibition of ACE-2 by small interfering RNA or by a competitive inhibitor (DX600 peptide) caused a reciprocal increase in autocrine ANGII and corresponding decrease in ANG1–7 in cell culture media (both P < 0.05) and, moreover, induced AEC apoptosis. At baseline (without inhibitor), ANG1–7 in culture media was 10-fold higher than ANGII (P < 0.01). Addition of purified ANGII or bleomycin-induced caspase activation, nuclear fragmentation, and JNK phosphorylation in cultured AECs. However, preincubation with ANG1–7 (0.1 μM) prevented JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment with A779, a specific blocker of the ANG1–7 receptor mas, prevented ANG1–7 blockade of JNK phosphorylation, caspase activation, and nuclear fragmentation. These data demonstrate that ACE-2 regulates AEC survival by balancing the proapoptotic ANGII and its antiapoptotic degradation product ANG1–7. They also suggest that ANG1–7 inhibits AEC apoptosis through the ANG1–7 receptor mas.",""

We thus hypothesized that IFN-γ may play a major role in the pathology by triggering immune-mediated alveolar damage. As we assessed or re-assessed some effects of IFN-γ on a number of human lung epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, chosen for their wide use in the literature, we found that alveolar epithelial cells were more sensitive to IFN-γ, in terms of proliferation inhibition and enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis. While similar effects were obtained on fibroblasts, concentrations of IFN-γ 4–8-fold greater were required. In addition, both epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines were able to secrete large quantities of T cell-targeting chemokines, similar to the ones detected in SARS patients. Based on the clinical data collected previously, the available literature and our in vitro experimentation, we propose that IFN-γ may be responsible for acute lung injury in the late phase of the SARS pathology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07f68de819ce6bd4b2263886791ee9af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/088ccaf73675fc3efcc0d83fc3011973, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c35683f846758f957ac392c96b684a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e0a3fb0645f466e54e0817dacca0770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21f912971b86f297e51ec263a071c671, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e733b9ef5c9300c5ff094bef32dd9a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31ec24aa6a7af05c63fbc6c3dd217cd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f3bea7e2e0a529017d00a8181b5fdaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fe491bda5ef975fa43b7538688957af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41960d06f7f2be8a6b7a72dd2a65742d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42b5137e8530ebf5b3099305b7d0405d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/558207c8c833f3a585fe495a930f256a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5809ffd9ca26dea123d8b41db560ad4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59d65e0dccdad4a4af76cb305046abcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87440ff20fe6716dc07569fec754dee1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88d7c83944e28ae1fdec0723751f819a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9036b214b689062c13be6bae51db3903, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d9a40276ca3d78cea567828fb05d7d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2ff3f4b4203754917e2d3e07712af15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad0b667bbb616e0bb5b07d7078c439ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ada01f8ce37d308ef50fa2e5ed933152, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b940e689fe756ea25cec8d93a6b90d0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb54a5c90a553f722aa6efcb8d85702d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdaedc49ed603b6674e1743e3cc0fd14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce244db32fa99b16486c4ecbbc3ce435, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d847d0173b6dc8f708e238853bddcd0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea238c7a9348e4d06e910ddcb80914cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcefdbd147fbdef1652a2bb37e1fb7ea"

Innate responses are essential for subsequent induction of potent adaptive immune responses, but little information is available about innate antiviral responses of the chicken trachea. We hypothesized that TLR ligands induce innate antiviral responses in the chicken trachea. Tracheal organ cultures (TOC) were used to investigate localized innate responses to TLR ligands. Expression of candidate genes, which play a role in antiviral responses, was quantified. To confirm the antiviral responses of stimulated TOC, chicken macrophages were treated with supernatants from stimulated TOC, prior to infection with AIV. The results demonstrated that TLR ligands induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons and interferon stimulated genes in the chicken trachea. In conclusion, TLR ligands induce functional antiviral responses in the chicken trachea, which may act against some pathogens, such as AIV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dbf6128627f8781065e772945617c73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2905ee24e71ec15aaf2940d60a4afd27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29e3cf404035b9a837f419a1b0f12dcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c4505b2f23ca127729ad33bc43c0cd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36159d12e8da3cbc5a6a378f57366fbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b9dca838e342d431aa742d015d617f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4169cc8cfd615c8f0428b3ae93be515b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44aa30a558e97bfe101ae225d1d8824c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44bb0bd29bcb5f7cae4958f3ed5874fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50d79b25a82fcff053d410a46636c85b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51acb12f712499f35ba550a2213d5af1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58725f558b48d9d62c668fb935e5d3b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f2d92fe28ccb2a16a50f1ea695ab81d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f9f4edfbf2675833bdee1e2d23b7d89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/628cc8e08e3ee6ef0085e3401ae1c36c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64b400601532b97cef1f28d2fca04eab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6545530d792923c2c339bb20de59dd81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a1b29cd787b479627022ad2de258b2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c5221e31d547888d252cc7e20e2442e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7db374242cedf903b5ba1da1ec136ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/866959d25cc68e556f04098ad0188a49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a630f4a57c6f8650dfebb8992d8f2bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c7e704c3500d0935f83687646cf7a8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e2ea5eb6ef067993d8fef47e00fd55b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/974379340393cb622bb6c82cafb8d1b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/986047d163dec98558c1fd4084578d32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2e9b443fa6055b3570d6e13290d00f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac51a8124d45ff1746e79fb6da167918, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1b0dfbcaaaaf141990c7459b267ed41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b28628e228368d1f20230153230b3fe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6190971b7377d1c3f5e89d374371332, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcc68da48539f10a9b9f4bfa6bafb346, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c19a31f5eebec56ac7c3b2cd3662b732, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c71f8fd02e1a769e5cedc25154cc4731, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1d211cc0499466d4ace239d585979e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2ac4b36ef1878029b3b95c3aae8d868, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d35a55df562ac912954e52c4c0210db9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9d85bd78f22c42dfdb3128d10b56b15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da1d6b26b3b83c5161427a18e68a0e85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd38de0d5cb9bdb3d0efde4ac18f7c89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7251109659cf3faca9b8d40acd73ab0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa4cfb88c728700240f105f9ff18b62c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc058043015ab35583cf94125d3b1db5"

In recent years, antigen mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some xeno-antigens. However, until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti-idiotypic antibody and a self structure. To address this question, we used human IgE as the self structure and a well-defined anti-human IgE mAb (BSW17). We describe the isolation of two anti- idiotypic antibodies specific for the anti-IgE antibody BSW17 from a non-immune human Fab phage display library. Interestingly, these two anti-idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described IgE peptide mimotope isolated by panning on BSW17, but they cover a much larger epitope on the IgE molecule. Accordingly, immunisation of rabbits with the two anti-idiotypic antibodies induced high-affinity antibodies with the same characteristics as BSW17. Thus, our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti-idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation, and confirm Jerne’s hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06484d149686b6a357439cfeaa6d3992, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19b5a72c5bbb9282976be4dbbe264506, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aa47c747855692c2266bdcf6c869f20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ba97ec45f090a36964543b8a68a78f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2995565e2bd15289557b8fd638daf67a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49055c152d92887aeb94066e8a3306a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a0a0370a69c2957535982ab987d048a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fb2c1f62e310e7ba247caeff9fb0c53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53a385e576a23d6116ae453a82b093eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/549791b8ab0fb1576bf693e5a3eeb3d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6892525b2d8717ec2bf4d65e75fa4e09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74c9d1d8528aa20ddaf01ad42ebebfae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f5fc53fee4f5043ab352fcb2fb0ec34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81c333cd4de65ba4e0d3ae98d5bdcb9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/857f3fc95f507f211ef69d14427a237a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89ae3ffdc3f1faf8fce22e08600ca004, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929e9da7c61b61eedec2ac2e480630f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99a630810331ada95ebebc6fb0ad93b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a4a9d52d9959d699a839b09a7018e9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e72bee54ff404a02114fe99c7631937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2eb28769eb958e3475bb5c0e508fc19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a375b5f52a8854cce57b44ddf3c6f4c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a55e047cc828873ce705518843640284, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6951594ca4cac35bc70a15ed935f2e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9cc8406e9235117a794ab4b5c5e473b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b80ccb1eb3a9f883407930f815ae2d1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8d7c65177509ec05bda2f2e6cd89444, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd64f5f2072f45d36b9182e828a315dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3beca9daf24c9fc48c20f3c2d4788a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7fe1e95ff95058955f5f5570d529d95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d04a84ad5594e5d6825f2591ef2296a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d97529bd51a8b021bc367a7c3ffd3cd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df844d8de4776137ca6a5501d97586d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8fd29037b8c176864c0764093ed8ad7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efdc5675133a744b14cf37216452f70a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f34aab460f9fc83c768b9baf7100b0bf"

Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species’ fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide- and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants’ feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission. The findings point out the occurrence and fecal shedding of previously unknown AstV in sheep and goats and pave the way towards a better understanding of the diversity and transmission of AstV in small ruminants.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/004334ab997899a9d2f350af00e50f29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00f1c59331f4da73c5aa31049de1d1fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01bc7a0c18e9a5fe1a8890ed42726fd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02e860f46e8baffc74c29f1b5b4ad539, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06a34cb28af3a7810226b9db60306c72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c3c9dfc54a29adb988643dc3476e3d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fa86f2fcd54cda27e38cf1f35b6da30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1161a353e44ab91430d660278f9b749f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12a24926b15ccdcd17f97dafa9d44380, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/185e3c1d8625113449335c4afbe79b67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19ae01e092d61f6508b2f002c1779d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20904d4b32f18da1a41bedcabe720522, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25b3b553bcc0bfd8e58a788233e244ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a9cc0571d65dd114fc5f5f3bacc3835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3212e5b456293306e31e229bfe2398cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33e5b270f037b674f0e3b30d4e61b78d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c33babbaa5d4f1db83d1d8d59a7d0e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c677d052926c8bc339fb233b1929ffe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dd7b7480e66f2ebf7a84b32dc9718c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/414dcf98acaab415dc40fcf0d3bf933a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4811b3629e34df88c41b2bcc1ecceb30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c892842fca5ce8dfeae2d955f9cce11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e93ec26ddff1175bf0c7b8c2a2a2ea0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4eed2711b1dd5a74882aa28c7db27d1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5086d21c0c5bb721c8c6ebbdcb353f94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5458634c7d113a6e91220d005a0e8dcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/583901bf4a31d4b3c3440ac6cc67cf6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b760f8faf5ece13780f9d2bdec24e67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ca469de3e1ea16b2aefbdcd577ec1d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62ed81c93bce60c32123ef93f2921cbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6404927150f892f691b99885d9396f3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6421d81dd0740ee7ca858465835dd21d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c5a37b7ec9e711b59807f8e918d2f65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/789ef87287d5749663a3793936e75081, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c23e89409597d5e003477bd458e813b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c8dc291b66cc2444e496c2d00f816b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d2c30a3d37415e6a1f0080839ad1cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/869bafdd4800e5767e2f68fee279e079, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bef2bbe4daec3f8fe928ed0df56cb60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d3c3af82a43b45ebacd674f23b28dbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9220b07e3eafd7a8aee5704e7bc0bbab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/960f65fc5fc79c91d9b7e62617e01e27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9748c15806d8b043eca99d770e68f10b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a239c497d50eecc57b69950de84aa598, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6e64ba24a3cde19a07cda0c6768c8bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9fc06d52ecb894a35d83d2427d0bdbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa7b0ab30917552ef1d6d1dbffc1966f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ada38eedc1b011d806eb3b1dea4785b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b343f6350e05cca888731d74d8dc64a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba634358b913d59c79549961dfa10fe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd22be00c60fa578f6eb9b92fd9b81d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3cae28577f3ea32493952806046e4f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb5f3be16b4b031b3971c0bac60e98f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb89c8aeaedddefb7d83c4e0922b041, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0b9097ef7a0ec77548bd5e4dfb859e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0d5a36fd791a689077ba81ae2d7a956, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e49d85b41534ed59ebfe46edcb2cd2ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8a8b47a9d0bd3a1a0c92ce1eea47487, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef474255062af83a6a7bd0900f2f8dad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3ba4da866d50b046b4d4c47770ae7d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f416798eb4c3f0d92d176366bb300711, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f886f7a5f0569a837a054e2cd1af59fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc6fa20ee3a805a0f0f074cc251d2643"

The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease. Trial registration.

Data Sources We retrieved review articles and original research from MEDLINE, OVID, and PubMed (1950-June 2009) that addressed our topic of interest, using the terms respiratory virus, asthma, IgE, atopy, and viral-induced wheeze. Study Selection Articles were selected for their relevance to viruses and their role in asthma. Results Much of the data in support of the viral role in asthma focuses on rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiologic studies have used factors such as day-care and family size as surrogates for infection in studies that support and negate the role of viruses in the development of asthma. A large volume of literature supports the theory that virus exacerbates preexisting asthma by setting off the inflammatory cascade. No mechanistic studies fully explain how viral infections can translate or exacerbate atopic disease. We provide information from our mouse model that suggests that dendritic cells, IgE, and FcɛRI are critical to the induction of atopy. Studies of patients taking antiviral agents (eg, ribavirin or palvizumab) support the notion that interfering with respiratory viral infections may decrease the development of atopy. Conclusions Many studies suggest strongly that viral infections may predispose patients to the development of asthma and other atopic diseases. Further, mechanistic studies are necessary to allow for the development of targeted therapeutics to prevent the translation of viral into atopic disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d3e4e163dab33ed4cbe8abf6e08e209, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/315c581ad517913ab4e5b72049282fd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31a28ae827fe37fbd8206578479d5ab2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c70ff4d67ebd7a068ab449bff0b0712, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53ee801b14186134564b9768cf7c2b6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7920163021407a7301dceb275ee3f63a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85edbf00bfdd3cbc4e2e7f29eb95f15f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/879dd7784433d9b631a1db7bd3fa1126, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af88def7815a276f318d63acf5b8e2be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd3f2864d0598538249cbaadd1f17b3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e72cce65321634ee275d2493127caf77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f81085de01a235334d6edae583f0a449, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa003f64ebc6ac59b08639aaddda52d3"

This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections. This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/070477cf65b4cf1ae2165c704da8a6e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fae938ddfc3c8ca7b1a09cc9015a686, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ff6f34716b73d642326db35a25a7d18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20f594365cee060397bd9572a315b232, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27011d392200f3ca4bc3cbac10b73a52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b40b3c4f97e624ab5182b6a34c6b4cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fd40def52563d4d87699cbfb443078d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a68cedfaca3a51d76aefa7f2b4693b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4872729a59fa2dca74392afc686960ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c59a05c3e57496840b25faac8a84d79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53c8746ad308d9891fb69b5121011027, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/554d9c8ff4409cd0a858ac4ea919a1cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64dcd8c74cfad39ebe078b187c79a66d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e8a74b8df00cebe74fd21bfd8778d53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f0251559696b54952bd46d47960e422, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ff870035ec18916152cd70861d51ad3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75cd5ae8cf90cb2922cc86453f6155a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/781960448861111f2fe0f8a4ea3ae4e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e30ab8967993e460fc428f1eed920f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ee80e754f2f61acacecaf5928579667, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83f60c93ee2aa0e86f962c2ce3effc02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bcde7aea45018f03207f3bd64a33554, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96f3f0f5e4a4d638ca91aa8d0d92bc59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9885b50d90465c9c9f68ae1013d05417, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a40a96ebafaa6e3868e7fae7120f937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ff08acfb027beb7116cb7759b0951d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa3a836db71505733e5fa4f699005b38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c18cb7ceb17a543b9f88142bb98f685d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c89433bcd3aae4f5f13979ef569a9ab3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cac9e6e09032d6fe7197f7981303e60f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5d7e360c9f710f55585a0db9768fd0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd956c971158c56e6dbbc4e18b5fde1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df6a49f550b290255c33edd252662ff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e19175f19f6ec4c5996a4f99d4fa64c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb010994e4d2f4806b72a3f840c57d7a"

Unrepaired DNA damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence, which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age‐related phenotypes. Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole‐body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells. To decisively test whether and to what extent WBI in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages, we exposed young male C57BL/6 mice to sublethal WBI (0.5–4 Gy), mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe. We followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age. None of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock‐irradiated (0 Gy) animals for the parameters measured. Even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal WBI in youth (4 Gy) exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis, robust T‐ and B‐cell responses to live attenuated West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal WNV challenge. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a4829f76ded3fcb884e642c80c303cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ea1b696f6f2d141e8499471f341352f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11a8673ae1d42dd5dc44928e224c5df2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/134a30be4eb255370c1474d771178313, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fdef1b097cfdabf31d438cfbbede799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28e9f555f43b09aa3d80e603ea5249c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/351eb211dec0f74cc3f11e9a0bdd660b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37251088a2bbc398dfc0a99c356ed511, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39462b93211b4f9d9abf9d294aa83d40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40338ae9700117a33279a7c7a1fdeb43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46090264a37a645b25bd53e0108e236b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48b613e2aaca7dd3f4faecc4c1972e1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fc3d3c08f0b84c701c1c5c2031f4ccc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5050426907e418f53a77cdc8ae3faf12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f750751e632ce5f5ce4e3bb67910000, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fd40690fb954f149aba4184568ea723, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67186922a2405d604773262bd156f895, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6941f0ceb71684015c7bf2b0a4de66df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7edefeb20230c4549594428bdc410e39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fb52670ef089227700f6f6404126d09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95d3414eca2fd78f4af114ed629fced1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a589f77b06012c36c9a6bc88da110364, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa78939a42fd9b5d1ddc1d87113a69d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac3ebaf4b3fa80d19f5c5bc4547c4957, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac680a92f439e7f9993720cd9e001188, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b07ad4a68bf37b8ca426cefa5391ea50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2554e1cda7a645adbaa98e28d294f4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b53a10fd1a625b2f78eab05cde67b16c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5db30ab23cd491da3846aa62380e74e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfcd12fcc0a71fe4acc519266f32f56a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5ba2e9cccadbd81bb5e92f415181daf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e129aac4ab39b400b04a52e4ee77785a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4888652917d306000041cae9f6ca233, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edc57e496fe0c4983fd5cf7b3af34212, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f507b5c270dc6b4172d966a97e85b3b8"

While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-γ by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-γ and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33-induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17-mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Graphical Abstract","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b103426ce759ab3510ba2d1c495a1db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dc8dda549c641e0963a3d3130027c47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dd032fe9c295de9690470735f755816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e177cbb2ce23afa0b2719402f0c9da4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13a15f48f7984aff6018c672b233431e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/143662d1ee533ee0e44ecea1c6beec67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16d07de68ef7dc399356203632c6fd3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/200e31761b5065e6b1be0f8b5363c6b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dc9bc72e7a46bb67821f037455b5c3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36994043675ce4938177e100bf0d4da9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e978ccb494d4864def2585cc81bf072, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/420858b2c0c77f54f85af4cfcd47fc97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b8b2290cdb06a324ac6dc184c5d1953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50798f16b25b527c86de945a8987ab31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/571bb5d3991e795d0ae0a06d02c51dd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5863fe31ebb12e2ddc92645d9abb2239, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f324fb498a3badfd00741b9acc9bba3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fce7fe220fbd21d72216d2e4eb68f8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7541810d00c1f1e732eaee0cac45d291, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7eb09157aa75af94bcb0f1559c716996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8227d59d449fd57f08db07006e72d70f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/914fff8aac27e3760a2e670eb53e9bf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91c0cda2501b553f0dc0ea1328146356, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94e2dee875345c39879e2cd79d05225f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e11c75da6e595c38405c8f99735ee9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a90d9e96f2cfdb61964971c6805590e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af62d3de457665f4666d8afa60c7043d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afa8e255f2076e474e88b1ea1daac3a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8043c3f293e0da7b0874a36ce15ba13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb65d351ec20fbf1ef9b84c969595c63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc0797cc2596088e0ee3fb79848a82b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be4f14cb23792fb16aef93836a533307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c01dbd3c56f091427c3ac5b8715c1021, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c21da3f1a3b37adec500f9dc2317d3fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3953e0b992624ed278a4ec0d80ef8e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c76cf89e212ca7150220a3812aa57db2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8250df5e8b62ebd16e56768b522de47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c915c8db83995e6f5647f6f0234bfeb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2f4113ebe02e511551ecc1a6bb4af4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d35bdc489721944566a5058946339e71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3d7f7de02bcb81c6b652fde0e9f3e1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9cbcc3a8652a4b7da01f47ce8718dd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecf9b44d628967e7e99a2d6c30836aea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9df318e511d920fb277401a0b478019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa793dd1873283e2fc476895df1a29bb"

Unlike the mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes, which largely target mRNA from the 5′ and 3′ end, viruses instead use endonucleases that cleave their targets internally. This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s). Yet, how mRNA endonuclease specificity is achieved in mammalian cells remains largely unresolved. Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03c014b4fcc45b4d060a3834a5bf88c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04b05efad7ff49f49c40e3d749092ead, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a79b01c35ac8cb6849d9566f28d7fc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12cfa4dc390552bc854c16c5feab2d0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c150caf4c8340538da61306711a4131, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26386078e1bedaf876705dae5dc9cf64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2792e907a12774876c80f79cf5f28597, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a640933f0861ce29df2e15fe5064fb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33ea003c39e0df64cf8279642eb64f16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/362e73532b5a8841d63f842d5cb3a033, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c9de0a5ef4285bba114ae2aeb9ac1d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f5230d0326bb78f8e477fd21ffed554, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5238a07fd8eee78a15f35c0e137b6738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ddd1e1bffa77118945ac4fafb289dc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64fcc6a67ed9e8a1feb4fce74f617c7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66e22b6eb6b04c5f335be138c810e965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7156ca73190f8c727795d787cf70a9b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7da5674311c69facf104743c7724e20d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8153e4c8c15a7ae8d37ef3708827da1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bb3ab82594e04e5764719597c739fd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dfd1e9e1f76f181301f25c8ec0a49d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ef69b80cfb732588cd5e902efe6bae0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9096a43fa63cf74f4ef5a1c19b0d45d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ed88e74855f53d7d1f6b89bc2ff7196, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae2967d39defb0b89b23445303318c02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0f9ee3c03211eb4da0b96b542d3dd59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4e889d0028b69833695fecd0c8523cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9ff3a6886f0261374825569f1694103, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc79a5a5aabd4842c881511ff592b179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7d87a63852bd4af8d55157dd154b934, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc52209d629d26ca18d438a782eb902a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3b141a98f9413803748aef44581332e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa4ff4cd603e08c72236695f47849ea1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe94e2740c280b1f3e88e32831794600"

In patients with “HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia” (MC + HCV), a higher prevalence of thyroid autoimmune disorders was shown not only compared to controls, but also versus HCV patients without cryoglobulinemia. Patients with MC + HCV or HCV chronic infection show a higher prevalence of papillary thyroid cancer than controls, in particular in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Patients with HCV chronic infection, or with MC + HCV, in presence of autoimmune thyroiditis, show higher serum levels of T-helper (Th)1 (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) chemokine, but normal levels of Th2 (C-C motif) ligand 2 chemokine, than patients without thyroiditis. HCV thyroid infection could act by upregulating CXCL10 gene expression and secretion in thyrocytes recruiting Th1 lymphocytes that secrete interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. These cytokines might induce a further CXCL10 secretion by thyrocytes, thus perpetuating the immune cascade, which may lead to the appearance of autoimmune thyroid disorders in genetically predisposed subjects.

RSV vaccine development has been hampered by results of clinical trials in the 1960s, when formalin-inactivated whole-RSV preparations adjuvated with alum (FI-RSV) were found to predispose infants for enhanced disease following subsequent natural RSV infection. We have reproduced this apparently immunopathological phenomenon in infant cynomolgus macaques and identified immunological and pathological correlates. Vaccination with FI-RSV induced specific virus-neutralizing antibody responses accompanied by strong lymphoproliferative responses. The vaccine-induced RSV-specific T cells predominantly produced the Th2 cytokines interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-5. Intratracheal challenge with a macaque-adapted wild-type RSV 3 months after the third vaccination elicited a hypersensitivity response associated with lung eosinophilia. The challenge resulted in a rapid boosting of IL-13-producing T cells in the FI-RSV-vaccinated animals but not in the FI-measles virus-vaccinated control animals. Two out of seven FI-RSV-vaccinated animals died 12 days after RSV challenge with pulmonary hyperinflation. Surprisingly, the lungs of these two animals did not show overt inflammatory lesions. However, upon vaccination the animals had shown the strongest lymphoproliferative responses associated with the most pronounced Th2 phenotype within their group. We hypothesize that an IL-13-associated asthma-like mechanism resulted in airway hyperreactivity in these animals. This nonhuman primate model will be an important tool to assess the safety of nonreplicating candidate RSV vaccines.",""

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D). Alanine replacement of the motif I residues (AA-E-D; four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to that of MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low-passage-number (passage 10 [P10]) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.",""

Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV-1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge when compared to other viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large naïve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of henipaviruses. We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity, and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnAbs against the HIV-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data. Further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e72ecd18dbff0dab999126215a7fb12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/159c16c3bd6a3ece621cc4600417123b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a1d8b80d13eb2ce6f47356bf8abdde7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/275145cd62c90c1b066eddb5f37670b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31c058f4fdf0321f92a6ffd5b5ba5ccd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3275ba79a5678d3f927ee07f32b37d13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a5053e3f9651db516ec765853a26a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d9b243017a605505a3c38c84025f152, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4614149f0008796547619aef006d722d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46cec864726937f00d4e0798e79e20d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/524c8266a90a2129d9f8227ced3d8194, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e9e41b102575343d597ddaa7b71a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b2a02a14400f7e421ba7ce6d2864a10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b870cb10aa14c01ea2ad270d747e3c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/603b005513b1a425f1fece277ca561a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d0bf9324a7ea95bacbb15ce30470ba5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84eeaf4ed0bb1f8f925818e242b9e2bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fbd4c176a31f612169acdfe1fe9e3e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d0f405c5d3458e0f99b564d010c0f93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a539a1a79c50deec66267264b069a95e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a787ae518ec31701effeac897e333465, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8e32cf4b510370abefd62fddbdec49f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aab1a761839845d5a9175e710cdb554a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acf02674a2817bb808228a92f0a8d130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adb5f0c66b5cab39f2fd49c5d732345a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adc92cdcf08bb6631e27d26974851904, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b786978ae302d8a4199499ea3c6660ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c22db88e4b8754b9b878e4e40bd160aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7e789d694d2d54866ccbd9dcc171df3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d372058244fa3648a5263d95ffa3b6cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4fdc370137c247102941d2ff9d1e041, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d76a896e0d5b0c349d8d7623b0119365, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dca56f50a7f61f9dd76f77b850a8c508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/debf0dde98635f0412d492ffb372d930, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0524d29c8f9779e795853f7c06f0123, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec6116a106a3195e25d1ab02133f0020, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe31b0cbdbf7c0b6992a5ea3647ed022"

We had suggested first that, in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans, might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. Indeed, statistical analyses suggested strong negative correlations between the allele frequency and historical parameters including the colonization dates by Mediterranean civilisations. The gene flows from colonizers to native populations were extremely low but colonizers are responsible of the spread of several diseases suggesting that the dissemination of parasites in naive populations could have induced a breakdown rupture of the fragile pathocenosis changing the balance among diseases. The new equilibrium state has been reached through a negative selection of the null allele. RESULTS: Most of the human diseases are zoonoses and cat might have been instrumental in the decrease of the allele frequency, because its diffusion through Europe was a gradual process, due principally to Romans; and that several cat zoonoses could be transmitted to man. The possible implication of a feline lentivirus (FIV) which does not use CCR5 as co-receptor is discussed. This virus can infect primate cells in vitro and induces clinical signs in macaque. Moreover, most of the historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-Δ32 allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs. CONCLUSION: We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading. A cat zoonosis, could be the most plausible hypothesis. Future studies could provide if CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role in FIV pathogenesis. Moreover, studies of ancient DNA could provide more evidences regarding the implications of zoonoses in the actual CCR5-Δ32 distribution.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/112f2fc0b6a6e0978e88ed1d7a3c8c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d645c66019ae02086b7210383fd9df9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/243ca0b745d27a02b68d92e0ce7d8a84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b32384445d76c63411dfcb8b1a4d5e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b93a163d394b39ae8f7be3dc4beb614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/306a292043f8d1dfabf352a42b03a1ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30b09343583cf9a1aee38bbfe6ba8c7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37df84813c92e926113cd3745ffe4667, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6704adce2c13d8af2ba34357292535f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d4d38986c0df3f4e442e5de1727ca83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/780b8d489f77668d31a2fc06d516e243, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a698ab6663388c7e8cbd7c36932acc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb404f2e9254a75df7baa66e6c1ca81e"

Catheter ablation represents a suitable therapeutic approach. However, the exact localization of the origin can be challenging, especially in cases of low PB burden during the procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated mapping algorithm on the basis of the hypothesis that mathematical optimization would significantly accelerate the localization of earliest activation. METHODS: The algorithm is based on iterative regression analyses. When acquiring local activation times (LATs) within a 3-dimensional anatomic map of the corresponding heart chamber, this algorithm is able to identify that exact position where a next LAT measurement adds maximum information about the predicted site of origin. Furthermore, on the basis of the acquired LAT measurements, the algorithm is able to predict earliest activation with high accuracy. RESULTS: A systematic retrospective analysis of the mapping performance comparing the operator with simulated search processes by the algorithm within 17 electroanatomic maps of focal spreading arrhythmias revealed a highly significant reduction of necessary LAT measurements from 55 ± 8.8 to 10 ± 0.51 (n = 17; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: On the basis of mathematical optimization, we developed an algorithm that is able to reduce the number of LAT measurements necessary to locate the site of earliest activation. This algorithm might significantly accelerate the mapping procedure by guiding the operator to the optimal position for the next LAT measurement. Furthermore, the algorithm would be able to predict the site of origin with high accuracy early during the mapping procedure.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d02a94ccd8ff3aff628abf1bb426efd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5176b267c0722c4ed922896d73a7cbcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b78ef55fd5526d5513f1e1d01df7dc20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8014eb59b45cb59fb80d05f1b82f69f"

Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high- and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro. The discordant high-fidelity phenotypes in this study highlight the complexity of inferring replication fidelity indirectly from population diversity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0548e5bf9a9f011798a19b9d37691f8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/074168100ed0a07ecb67a0e0204208fd,

Molecular tools enhance case definitions, increasing specificity and reducing misclassification, and are now a standard tool in outbreak investigations. Although it is assumed during an outbreak that a single microbe is causing the clinical symptoms, it is possible that a microbe of the same genus and species but different strain is causing disease during the same time period. Molecular typing can distinguish between outbreak and nonoutbreak strains. Molecular tools also facilitate estimating parameters key to understanding the transmission system, including the incidence, prevalence, transmission probability, duration of carriage, effective dose, and probability of effective contact. Molecular tools enable one to trace the dissemination of a particular subtype across time and space and thus develop theories of transmission and dissemination, determine the origin of an epidemic and test theories about reservoirs and evolution of a particular pathogen, follow the emergence of new infections as they cross species, testing the hypotheses about the apparent transmissibility and rate of evolution, and follow mobile genetic elements conferring antimicrobial resistance or virulence between strains within a species or between species, and so develop theories about evolution and transmission within the populations of pathogens.",""

The traditional view of these RNA elements are as local structures present in non-coding regions. However, this view is changing due to the discovery of regulatory elements in coding regions and functional long-range intra-genomic base pairing interactions. The ∼4.8 kb long RNA genome of the tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) contains these types of structural features, including six different functional long-distance interactions. We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and, accordingly, we sought to assess the global conformation of the entire TBSV genome. Atomic force micrographs of the genome indicated a mostly condensed structure composed of interconnected protrusions extending from a central hub. This configuration was consistent with the genomic secondary structure model generated using high-throughput selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (i.e. SHAPE), which predicted different sized RNA domains originating from a central region. Known RNA elements were identified in both domain and inter-domain regions, and novel structural features were predicted and functionally confirmed. Interestingly, only two of the six long-range interactions known to form were present in the structural model. However, for those interactions that did not form, complementary partner sequences were positioned relatively close to each other in the structure, suggesting that the secondary structure level of viral genome structure could provide a basic scaffold for the formation of different long-range interactions. The higher-order structural model for the TBSV RNA genome provides a snapshot of the complex framework that allows multiple functional components to operate in concert within a confined context.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0050b4d5801e82868d2252252df2f396, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0638f5e63d090539e53b36e40a6b98d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14de117410c0ecb980f7eda73c321802, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22389fc79976f52439668b200c8951a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a08014ecc8c81da9dc08c3d044d4cae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a7910c164f62871e39b3923a079f2f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39504c3cdcf4b0e03fafcb551d21563a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c15112b65c20e4d685e3125cda905a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d153a0752313fa6d66724bd9f6f1660, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50c4f329d920245aafea8161af9fbd63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53b507da178d6e584b8eb929528bffa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59f147200df223227d6050cd359c6256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bd97db512c5515a48f09536b0015104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bee5f440f57d720cd0ba382e01d5abb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f04b1eb8814a8e023671a9ba587684d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6862c8e5cb2c8c27d4a1d42ae31bd9d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b58a89ad1e394f7c5be55bb37d51f81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e216fd02fc9b9a7be271518cada97c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82e80009de1c78c65cf7e93cf9ae434e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8580c3b0323c636774f56291e286bb16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/960e6e26a257e65ddef44f27ea767fcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5ffd8d2474be5f74c7798630cc56f82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6e2c67f5321ccf831d2696c7bcca8c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4b30e469b4f4025c9142858883eeae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7a52886e87705245b2312d15f3cc19e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf1bb0d89c56af756bde3c11a294b072, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c08387ff5a62e1b7b00e9c1c9263e676, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c255eab4eb293628b68bd9ccfa47462b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8d23a4b2fadd6a2115da78ee0a17f89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da16d673838bd79a81f8f062778970ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daa7210e3c6d8082f2f8084a44fc6ee2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e440a421bbfdf265ac5bb6f3ac06054f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e56b884d6bee813901110661e05dc752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d3335bff4d82804db95854edf3d926"

SARS has caused an outbreak in the world during 2003 and 2004, with 8098 individuals being infected and a death toll of 774 in 28 regions around the world. Specific humoral responses to viral infection remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the antigenicity of the SARS‐CoV genome and identify potential antigenic epitopes in the structural proteins. METHODS: Potential antigenic epitopes were identified in the structural proteins (nucleocapsid, membrane, spike, and small envelope proteins) and hypothetical proteins (SARS3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b) that are specific for SARS‐CoV. A peptide chip platform was created and the profiles of antibodies to these epitopes were investigated in 59 different SARS patients' sera obtained 6–103 days after the onset of the illness. Serial sera from five additional patients were also studied. RESULTS: Epitopes at the N‐terminus of the membrane protein and the C‐terminus of nucleocapsid protein elicited strong antibody responses. Epitopes on the spike protein were only moderately immunogenic but the effects were persistent. Antibodies were also detected for some putative proteins, noticeably the C‐termini of SARS3a and SARS6. CONCLUSIONS: Important epitopes of the SARS‐CoV genome that may serve as potential markers for the viral infection are identified. These specific antigenic sites may also be important for vaccine development against this new fatal infectious disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/010358017b573dea161ff4038af2e20f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0226f6199e4c29d144388033028598d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f3e8cac5add6c2ec55385cff2aeae75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23b967ec0a7ec5d4d99cd560f5a0dc55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27d89b15c588fb062b5773d19d2aa029, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f41d875feffcd7c39fc804f2d1c7ae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3483e19a833872df4fa7f2b9fbf5f5a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34c4999df12f5b67f0b67853c444d717, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e407f9edbdaa7fc109215b10d7abb29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b10671a55badcf594097fe901a8bf37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f8baf6eaff89dd4e010f9aa5f052ae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61a2f498af6560d5bc5d4fb6bbb6413e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64529395c0849666b5260efd904f5954, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d02aca20d4c890203ae4bc3a31dd67a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/716b2ab16ab52d3dcbc43233fe55b916, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/731870ae94f609f78fdada5aa7707e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73c2d02b2feb42cc6dd00570e99129c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73e9becdd4454cf5172a9219df419182, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/781e993ba415965c17a3fe7fe7206c90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8478909e5fae41f97e81510a999fe32e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/884694584afa8b5b4918be1bc99d1913, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ed057853de08dac1dd81aeb868a5c9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f2e1fbfab71a3b331066d811e03bfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ea2d0cfaf23232a2087391d85e0fe7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2cf67eeb013b068feb8d191412af1ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2fcd94d05b4eec7a60b3b9f5c9e8924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa91003903a8c7d8c5809ee1453af8a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6f97467980b9b579e405fcd590161bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0344682cbbb0cea940a2e2ad936fc39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3abba4db5edce81c5b35ea7c9ec50a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6d93ffa1c2123eca9332e427aa9942f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ceed59ef96ae40bc16ea74441fa4322c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2cb806b11b28a674f05c93c77a8a380, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfed982b624cc5e53572b16e53bc5aa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3b86c6659326f334c3bf3b686d28cd6"

An exciting new subdiscipline of metagenomics considers the ways in which microbes, particularly those found in the gut, have facilitated the ecological and phylogenetic radiation of mammals. However, the vast majority of such studies focus on domestic animals, laboratory models, or charismatic megafauna (e.g., pandas and chimpanzees). The result is a plethora of studies covering few taxa across the mammal tree of life, leaving broad patterns of microbiome function and evolution unclear. Wildlife microbiome research urgently needs a model system in which to test hypotheses about metagenomic involvement in host ecology and evolution.

Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. Aim of the study We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. Materials and methods Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid (18β-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-β were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Results Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18β-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300μg/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to counteract viral infection. Conclusions Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18β-GA may be one of its active constituents.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09e29dc89363c8c28a462090e6763bb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17366d8464ca16a5d3ae4d2477189b74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19dabf723fed548228b31726ab8e2888, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a807f432a343907fafbfa9006f2292e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ab456a60fa7dc61fa7113d6c12ac9bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/233ce7bd01df1301da24bc6c633bd7c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24b601df94e3165af26d34d6633a577b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/256b23ae33d8b3e897f6f05d535db68d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33a6c0037c7017006c5b8131b942ce21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/343f4f2f1d1fec5057f58819bed468b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37f7bf83e65c6f8737724b318a172387, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/385899c3723e2083df471f0731e5357e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a3650fea4890c2827450a04c76d8da4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b3f36aa7f35891b44597f5f4254fce8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e2b656f34d15208ded599f76e25004e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4640f49418a74c239a5eb2bb1d9c3730, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/473ee9ef538de91da91051f2f353f093, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4983dd23f36d1d020e4bfabb2df53fe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c0e617e3630f8bff2b5f658e83aa877, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e71a76a2934dfa512d02048e14626df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54037cc34c45bec57f5389fec8351c9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5669c0f15923c5994bd2bfe21d2fd483, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b786d0e0bdf0e380aff71e6fbce900b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fb18a5d06a59d01fcfabe8eb345b778, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66c8708b50ffededa801f7bdf0b07c4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bb251fb5531998ed9a0a2d682b6176d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c3cd222a0364900ca3f1c1a0ce3d96b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cfa2761b18bc446da0cefff80451864, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bb6872373addff30f77ad0553a2ae7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c2fcee04397442ef6ed0b4a165c7a10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cc71eee5a6b30977a1fde4915c6f84b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d2de41d6ceaf9dd25ff7326d7ba6763, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e0d6adb57a5476ef79145e662456b39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f9c4b4076ccd1a929143c873e2e3666, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d4f4e8276e2d128079a540c9adcbd64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8db0e3c40dcd3691c4ed9060029cb28d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93544273a812a7b48957b0eeb602c561, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9da7b2a26e58038b029af85adbb6f332, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a251da9baf7762fa368c11d78b48d77d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b670061f15e30ba1067f088fe594fe6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c78c136b07aa852c972221fcc27e5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b908cde6ab4ec2320217482132f5eeea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bba9eb60cad66bf70db452461af6a036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1098c6deef434b4b59c240330f8c684, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c736f2ed5edb4479800ccb9d564f9ee2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caaaa19be4031b3552d1601c5bceb62b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd11393ff8faf5d595dfdb7f64f0aaf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce2393dfae909f2096d6286994434c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1b8afdad064458c1d5edfde23118c28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d32ea69f80c38d4cea5e0aea1df3504b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d641bb7cd5323097e0ecccb238556feb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d776b8f3aafcb41fa48e28d412f1dd47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e28dda463274e91419595e129f4771fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4cf7b9cabd874bd1733d877b1a0cfaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea2b5a6ec0079efd625e4d1131fe68d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0c265e8b5e56e05bf561c322443d768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f19f1c7bc4da0f0b1d0e9933844ec84e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f5b39646f1af447fc79410981b84ec"

Therefore, induction of the host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO1), by interferon gamma (IFNγ) is one of the primary protective responses against chlamydial infection. However, despite the presence of a robust IFNγ response, active and replicating C. trachomatis can be detected in cervical secretions of women. We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFNγ response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel method to separate a pool of cells exposed to C. trachomatis into pure populations of live infected and bystander cells and applied this technique to distinguish between the effects of IFNγ on infected and bystander cells. Our findings revealed that the protective induction of IDO1 is suppressed specifically within primary infected cells because Chlamydia attenuates the nuclear import of activated STAT1 following IFNγ exposure, without affecting STAT1 levels or phosphorylation. Critically, the IFNγ-mediated induction of IDO1 activity is unhindered in bystander cells. Therefore, the IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism is functional in these cells, transforming these bystander cells into inhospitable hosts for a secondary C. trachomatis infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08f76796647b4d4a1b81cf8dcd98da3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0946fff0d9b6116f1db52f2b28080eb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17faca0b64296c5d58bfb0949c642383, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b376d0e66c5bb60402bab25e6cc89ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/226fa9624743357caf6bcd6373d2cdd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2680fd668ebc79554f304596703e1596, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a6c42ddc4d6f845d5b28f19e09809e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35c56bf248d2f14bc33d6d10eab2924e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36779f128de08f3d6b1aec1f9a75c512, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3906306317d11918391cfdb5168c6a54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ad9c10040d88f3dc42100a1f2fb1e17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d069b3b97cb6294df71bd7a0049ae78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3da0529983dcf0ef873bd91f46625593, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41018ffb03f2aeb9b4bb076ef6b6e92e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/496ade860d7ea77d639664a29b8bbfb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ab73bc38322c70f7e1bc9c9ef97bae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/537ed4962cf719a4ff38e92398459760, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/590afabc1221d354680100315341cd64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ea24d66d61fac0d31405907d9b63395, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/712eb23c406d8cd4ca25d2b642e8a49e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75e95c38cd9f17aceb18ac7c21dd624d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/783ec7549c33ff39cb464f91eed1a887, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d484f8a0fdbbd659580e4ad7f04c46e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81e401883fa3bd290e81fd3513d8bc03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8403a1016b1f58ab0989835715f54142, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87ae9c61743b20009134a49a20c722f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919aa8e2f4e60599e7da7015659a0b64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/920073f092bdfb2c0ce4c7047a18fa3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9daf5893e3d67e1e204f64c74f25fa94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e5e4d25fee42b9edaf215b428e3c56b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af744175a42f7127fedc5554d8f9f4e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afa420d8404d1aeb7a1b74b7f5e5aa9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba8d8b99f354d8ca4bd2495095bc3ce0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb070271031fd41941d3cbc9fbcf8d27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d364f38655b783b1ba63450c5f2b68a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/debb5c3a9ceb4390d57fc92de6e0c764, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e26f068f6440f4c41b5dafacc2a9558e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea686870b1873fbe666acef1ff565d31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed5a552ce9454f351acc7a43ce8f8137, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5aeb4a3fd8cb1ba4f99d49f0b358a12"

Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. METHODS: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. RESULTS: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days. CONCLUSIONS: Adding interventions to improve FVHH and visitor management to existing healthcare worker prevention efforts can help reduce HARVIs in the NICU.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0824afcaae11accbf50d6b73aa67836f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16de208a81f8c2e42dbcda1c9beb3deb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d9389e885e4d3b1fcd74bc233ed4e7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32bbc63cb2822ed39c219213e1b592ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d08ff8141b666546c99e8978cb48f7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cc0b7f8eb9088dbe94894ed624dd72a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7177da23856a394de85b612eec6bcdc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87f8a95bf1c4fc4c80b014c7d2703aaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8874e09cc2600e8895cd40c5ee359077, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/990d671d325a946d619a705b9ee5307a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a67b60173f86427101ff3adc5167d267, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6dac2358005464762f891ba7c478de2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6fbe0236bf2159b23d3cc8483910d16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c95e9917f84bd66486721eec5431dd70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdfc2e05ae9e73cc232b3e73b57b043e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d09dfa55d55b2949fc8678e100a5e26c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d937bee7b655db099177b354b7c4916f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e69b7000e089dd1fb583df56e171da9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcb3a60844e3a2e312bb9969531c98ce"

The existence of genetic variance for resistance in the host population is crucial to the spread of an emerging virus. Models predict that rapid spread decreases with the frequency and diversity of resistance alleles in the host population. However, empirical tests of this hypothesis are scarce. Arabiodpsis thaliana—tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) provides an experimentally suitable pathosystem to explore the interplay between genetic variation in host's susceptibility and virus diversity. Systemic infection of A. thaliana with TEV is controlled by three dominant loci, with different ecotypes varying in susceptibility depending on the genetic constitution at these three loci. Here, we show that the TEV adaptation to a susceptible ecotype allowed the virus to successfully infect, replicate and induce symptoms in ecotypes that were fully resistant to the ancestral virus. The value of these results is twofold. First, we showed that the existence of partially susceptible individuals allows for the emerging virus to bypass resistance alleles that the virus has never encountered. Second, the concept of resistance genes may only be valid for a well-defined viral genotype but not for polymorphic viral populations.",""

Despite significant effort, no evidence of infection of other mammals, mostly rodents, was found, suggesting that no other vertebrates harbored TCRV. For this reason, it was hypothesized that TCRV was naturally hosted by artibeus bats. This is in stark contrast to other arenaviruses with known hosts, all of which are rodents. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) to determine whether they could be persistently infected without substantial pathology. We subcutaneously or intranasally infected bats with TCRV strain TRVL-11573, the only remaining strain of TCRV, and found that low-dose (10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID(50)]) inoculations resulted in asymptomatic and apathogenic infection and virus clearance, while high-dose (10(6) TCID(50)) inoculations caused substantial morbidity and mortality as early as 10 days postinfection. Uninoculated cage mates failed to seroconvert, and viral RNA was not detected in their tissues, suggesting that transmission did not occur.

Methods PubMed was searched for all of the studies published over the last 15 years using the key words “Kawasaki syndrome” or “mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome” and “infectious disease” or “genetics” or “vasculitis” or “pathogenesis”. Results Various levels of evidence support the hypothesis that KS is a complex disease triggered by an infection due to one or more pathogens. Viruses or bacteria may be the primum movens, although no specific infectious agent can be considered definitely etiological. A number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified in subjects with KS, but none of them can currently be considered a real marker of susceptibility. Conclusions Various data suggest that KS is intimately related to infectious diseases and that its clinical expression is influenced by predisposing genetic backgrounds, but our knowledge of the infectious agent(s) involved and the genetic characteristics of susceptible children remains only partial. Further studies are needed to address the many still open questions concerning the disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50aed4a9cfd187c44b983c6e22d2b81a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67cfb486df37af762a799fb7ee8b4cf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69e3e42be3e8ddba76b987626704219f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fa31a53663a5dd364e8b89666de957e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7db11c9bef17bb2f3b1645f052cdd721, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ddc4f6f4aef78621cce57d25abb38b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89834df5cc7d4b0721eedba56b6432a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9643505817e2e0876c0b409e8134f3bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a24649b7e16e92bf4aa11f33d8d5b0fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adb3741d9e12418a52dbd3f83bd73f3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6a2838ed1288b7dd9a98ea65783b416, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c83f037bf0245c5550276798328cc241, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cadaf62fa437c8d8a902c2630cc3978b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbac293848ff145a2b7182415a4fe1ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1438a8a31967dc0d321057344a899a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e99b6f8f26275d1d17dc9905e003e716, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea7a49d8ec2da7b38e180b09f99aa23c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a72c5e5fd8409e16b0028435e12cf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f890ba4617092307cfc0c7421422ac07"

Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission. We propose that in future outbreaks of SARS or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens, simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dca6f25e34bdffe6e62f937bcb2ad36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f478e8dcf9662b6695bd4efa96fd77f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20a0af285e9ee7c268d2d7ee5b0b755b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/290c3ef0ace9087cfe3348becea54f76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/305e145a66dfda53a9d2ec897da45bb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/323c1435d608f9701ae98c7fc0cf5b45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/338b4aaa429c41dcc22775933322fe9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/581712348295bdf05120d13d5cc1da64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dafeecb1a340aab1a65be321b629697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6438b4d00e668fad2b79cd872a0ce9ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/687bef700f48e7725f9bfbfd7bac8913, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a118496b80de21d14f99fd204eb94cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72a0ea8dd7f745007497b08f2d83f9d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8978cd28c6f8fa9b5af3524208a2e508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4dc6619869e2de8866bee6df5059023, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc76623fa149a00b97c1882a5d588435, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d52c893ebe2874deceafaefdce4b560f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5c93990eb62d4b4f5a6ce3af0fe5ae7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7f716e9599b634aa987166f6e2fccd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df3e13881ff06723634b97d48c4f6e76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3ede18ab1300acf56bb80f5e5047f8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4522bceae00eb8d0612dd6736a2a2c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3ef039a352c76d787cb614fb7dc3687, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6f708d3b5183c0708be17f79e8a30a7"

Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/044273d0d92d0a9a7a77038806e7d7c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07a7dc960abb4ec53592afb9fdf6d4b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07fc3b299c04c385b5d248fc1c9958cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d20fa2d5164847259a0efbde3616ead, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/135cf157e98c0723d3e8e6636f26080b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16245501042e23cc348ef5342db63783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17f850576305e49c827af01def5ec663, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1852270b13a081329a82f488f00aaa0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/223b655aa1f71bc2ac84f73922cd62e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3585d23bd18aedf8242394e658de0df8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b4fb4b8f591dd7c2bef5197db65dcfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fc185ac2c4d12c2e425e3556b109722, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4022a5586aefdd0cd6fe415f702358cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4196f9cd415011c52ee4689fc0f1387d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51b3574921e9696037882f8aefce683c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a66a5a0cae0a5cb0ec5ab7289fe14fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e2e646fa2fcb5f717b8a8014089a623, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70a406f267bcbcd0f6967aa1b0a538ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86c5740f688bea82107b2da488d93b58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ba3d58c8c84adf98a8df8e3437ffd07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/966ae81d83193409b5c743f3767f60e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a383439def369d5f6759fc172db1237e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3c1b7d5e28b6c6c0a1577aca7c6765b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5841ef0ff795b554ca4683ab72b1bb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a68b19a5a8b3cfdbfd0d8d54f208a512, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aec8beb5c8952027eaa91cdb21b3cf47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b056aa5d5672bfa3e36b1ed5b114d1f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2a01857272e57dda8357d1d2ffdb3b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c719f05c527c8c64f615c897457cffa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d37141477c49fa71aa96b90fdc89dc74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d90af3f0fea877ccc02565a4d2cac067, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6aec61c719b5e7a3e12d31087e17bde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb7f33f2cd2a65a1329c3e3a51274493"

Objectives The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic PTSD in SARS survivors. Design PTSD at 30 months after the SARS outbreak was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Survivors' demographic data, medical information and psychosocial variables were collected for risk factor analysis. Results Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of SARS and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS. Associated factors included higher-chance external locus of control, higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity. Conclusion The study of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS showed that the predictive value of acute medical variables may fade out. Our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of PTSD. On the contrary, the adversity both before and after the SARS outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from PTSD. The risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the SARS survivors. With the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial challenges of SARS, an integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting may be a superior approach in the long-term management of complicated PTSD cases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04bb4da8761cea25fba48279c7c2500a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07e3990c90a14604121d5a95c7461d7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1441cbc9d42ac11378a7de00e16f5316, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3104b6c75e2dc8b6b13440b7e1da46f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36a90925f3b5e869ac56acc096818910, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38963aee8569e4be21a72087c40afe19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fb7c31bd5da3029b092838220e152a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b45b9fd1a68581fc6789d93afd955eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c5bcde5b136c75905d607c26d620667, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d32ade7d22e0ffb5b1dc23fd39290f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c7e9ddfc35f58551b22f998c49c1df6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/622364d1e91a00c4e58b2f243d613a63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6553825ced9eba9da8f78798771381b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7357ddc5e4c6ee4123bb36ba2c1492fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74af664fd34bc68133cc16f2403dd128, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b0d0b4632b29e56ed0f4c9ad97a5eac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/842bc709147c8094d6d50868fd86fcf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8439f9ff00f7125d2770024f10585271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f76ab8ccb4634b5f323efc8d5691303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97a9be8d3d1f0e8cbc64a1e6905b7afc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b72257c9a1ae441bc885ea63c0f6d7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fdc02a57c3997c180cf0852159c358f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a152fded7810e8f3f42c67d792ea3b8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b07f71f6b2dc4fef7e8d1cfd18f65db5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3d38a3830eb97ae0d39708aa1798425, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8a3abf28623faa425a357aca7ba4899, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbf91c53ceffe7091a00e36bb02d6c1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d66e49a4b3b7fb3b0b5ae1c6c215ceb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df7dc899cdf856201d0f123ba06ce073, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e780821067bb028f0ec5ab2349e09547, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee27620c8b0660ef22081486a6b54f5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee8c99345de214067f7abd286b5947d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0a67eefa32390b23b5db78c243ba5a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f36805b0d485bfbfb87036c3e8a55ab1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f669ab8dadab62a3169ff4a2b86f9925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9b3b71e5f9e654e9fe322b603582760, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbe34dd4764957c34c3dc500034e50ec"

Using a system based on transfection of cells with synthetic nonreplicable subgenomic transcripts derived from bovine viral diarrhea virus (family Flaviviridae), the existence of a replication-independent mechanism of RNA recombination, in addition to the commonly accepted replicative copy-choice recombination, has been previously proven (A. Gallei et al., J. Virol. 78:6271–6281, 2004). To identify RNA signals involved in efficient joining of RNA molecules, RNA recombination in living cells was targeted to the 3′ nontranslated region. Molecular characterization of 40 independently emerged recombinant viruses revealed that the majority of recombination sites are located in single-stranded regions of the RNA molecules. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that the frequency of RNA recombination directly correlated with the RNA amounts of both recombination partners. The frequency can be strongly increased by modification of the 5′ triphosphates and 3′ hydroxyls of the recombining RNA molecules to 5′ hydroxyl and 3′ monophosphoryl ends, respectively. Analysis of recombinants that emerged after transfection with such modified RNA molecules revealed a complete integration and efficient end-to-end joining of the recombination partner(s) in at least 80% of recombinants, while unmodified RNA molecules recombined exclusively at internal positions. These results are in line with the hypothesis that endoribonucleolytic cleavage and a subsequent ligation reaction can cause RNA recombination.",""

This work was undertaken to test the hypothesis that low molecular weight SB-AHGs (MW<235 for the free SB) make better antiviral agents than high MW SB-AHGs (MW>300). The plaque reduction assay method demonstrated that three compounds, I, VII and IX, had moderate activity against HSV-1, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 38.0, 23.5 and 52.1 μM, respectively. Against Ad 5, compounds I, VIII and XI exhibited moderate activity, with IC50 values of 52.7, 19.3 and 5.1 μM, respectively. Among the compounds screened, compound I (1-[(3′-hydroxy-6′-methyl-2′-pyridyl)methylene]amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate) was the most promising antiviral candidate, with selectivity indices (SI) of 10.2 (HSV-1) and 7.6 (Ad 5), respectively. Virus yield reduction assays indicated that compound I had less antiviral potency against HSV-1 than against Ad 5. The antiviral effects of compound I at a high input virus multiplicity of infection (MOI>5) indicated that compound I had effective anti-adenoviral activity at 24 h post infection. This work demonstrated that some of SB-AHGs only have moderate antiviral activities against Ad 5 and HSV-1 viruses. In general, low MW SB-AHGs have low cytotoxicities to the host cells.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e0ee1c6455998db890ae6e5688f95db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1053263876323b58e5329346c28493b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1378a1ff274a452f136cd0e4ec812043, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fa9c5610f24a9bd0cee3db499b5c9c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/213cb5337ca1619a8569cac44f1f665e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2753a9976b345407ac2435ed97e04787, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28c04a9b4ffc121d7fdd8a09247f24ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33e9bc6cc8535904dbb836f91739fa56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b492c29ae44b762adc11a6516eaa30b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d0055b5179bd17f6439c5798c9fddab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58b8bf7b514d162a1ab565ebeea2aa71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5aac8626c27c2e5b6958b8d81bdfd09d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/619addcf70e684e1fff2c3779d2eb5fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61e20d09a4927cf9e7ac503fea34a49e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6df97e56c6347f5e2843303c69eef90f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7347b56c1fbf0f3500f4e1a0dcfa4077, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/883f0fa9da4f3963851e25a4ee4683d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd8bded07833672427403d320cba5d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1c252450a7111f4a5b911ab33402a75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d1a0ed1aae3b8b83377e420e2fac20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d115aee597ae296e920ead4cf1c2471f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5aa2a34acf2ff18fbfd67815305d60d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5f6f24281dd004aabf964e0e4249cfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1cb249ff63636f52041c9075d21a676, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d6ccd1cf6c777b2dc9c775686123ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9d04342b0ff112e76622d4abeb6bff1"

In the United States, NEC strikes 1 to 8% of patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units, almost all of whom are premature infants. The incidence is low in certain countries wity a low premature birth rate, e.g., Japan. Two theories of pathogenesis are: the Santulli theory, which implicates three factors: ischaemia, bacteria and substrate; and the Lawrence theory, which stresses the injurious role of bacterial toxins on the immature gut of the preterm infant. Clinical and experimental evidence support each of the theories, but neither theory can explain certain clinical phenomena, particularly the resistance to NEC manifested by more than 90% of preterm infants, who never develop the syndrome. A unifying hypothesis of pathogenesis and a mathematical model of NEC are outlined.

Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis; despite availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States.

Most notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations; multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations; current pathogenesis hypotheses; suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment, including home treatment; future treatment options; and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed. Collaborative patient and physician efforts, crucial in rare diseases, are emphasized.

However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/241bc4e5de7f06c8bf0f28038d5c61fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58d1a74bd5864560e0a53a4e7e7a3dc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70b56659017a1d261934fd5a9db65c4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d523928956824f0219f81b8a3c7b91a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a126719682e25c5624c462a44472ad1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c83e6702b2750c7bd9485270d30f033b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccfb2496e0dc58e365d903b9c754ddcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d65f4ee4552234e7d208c67889e414a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4dfa9bcccb78f2140e2859dc7cf16f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd1cfa53cd802ca144e1faebabd43364"

Although a subject of controversy and a considerable scientific literature, we think that a solid understanding of ME/CFS pathogenesis is emerging. In this study, we compiled recent findings and placed them in the context of the clinical picture and natural history of the disease. A pattern emerged, giving rise to an explanatory model. ME/CFS often starts after or during an infection. A logical explanation is that the infection initiates an autoreactive process, which affects several functions, including brain and energy metabolism. According to our model for ME/CFS pathogenesis, patients with a genetic predisposition and dysbiosis experience a gradual development of B cell clones prone to autoreactivity. Under normal circumstances these B cell offsprings would have led to tolerance. Subsequent exogenous microbial exposition (triggering) can lead to comorbidities such as fibromyalgia, thyroid disorder, and orthostatic hypotension. A decisive infectious trigger may then lead to immunization against autoantigens involved in aerobic energy production and/or hormone receptors and ion channel proteins, producing postexertional malaise and ME/CFS, affecting both muscle and brain. In principle, cloning and sequencing of immunoglobulin variable domains could reveal the evolution of pathogenic clones. Although evidence consistent with the model accumulated in recent years, there are several missing links in it. Hopefully, the hypothesis generates testable propositions that can augment the understanding of the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.",""

During the August outbreak, 50% to 78% of hospitalised neonates and children were infected. Seventy-five percent of hospitalised preterm neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks and 52.4% of staff members were infected. Risk factors for NRVI in neonates were birth weight, gestational age, ventilation, oxygenation and hospitalisation length. Ninety-two percent of infected preterm neonates were symptomatic, mainly with bradycardia and respiratory worsening. These data provide additional evidence for a possibly significant role of HCoV in NRVI in a PNICU. The role of staff or hospitalised children in spreading HCoV is hypothesised.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/082c28cc67638cfdfec377f9c487e359, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d39cc28238390985c2bd5242c720ccb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e56c3baa9d5415bc5582e7c6889e46e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12bdee7e4f9466c860bdb7882b5ec0aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15ef31bec1737e442e0121771e431eb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/270173dffb0dca6c3fac533dd50e3465, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29d8a12b0745d5c70d8cc9170d8fb574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e04aff51c3bf6f088713c87ba0dfa77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e530d69952170f5a0500618850cd63b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fe9177e20c3d83bf72e39798599dbe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5655706f7bb31cee0bea6dbe5e3dd5a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ff2047ff5469b9634a7dea47795a47b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/672cb1fbdc78f139ca5f0f51263ea3e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/745f400a4d301be20e7d547f0f37a821, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92e8f6e42e5f980b04538f4c2de857fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95b06093c06f185536b571f88ba565d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fc5ad643736e0710947df0aba6e377b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a70632fc17fc440babed62a633c382a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9639567a5e70fe4c812f0e33e47f0ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac5775995569141ace6b20bc42a87690, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afeacb21b6e08aa07476c24e505a377f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8d71a059c060014939b3ef28463199e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0e636ac3f38cf40e9f012f6e24ce4d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d28441ea926717a433cb48187fe548d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4fb557e374cd6319cab78e2e58d4e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d69025b5c4e97b12a7b056484c11965c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dae15cf4bfc634dc9140536a2dc1efea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3af86b2d57437b1b34075d4286f6e43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f760e33ef577320000ed707b6f941bcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbbb08ce84321b4f737ade3a4c37c067"

The newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and reemerging influenza virus cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type VEE glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged mice within novel models of severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from SARS-CoV disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza virus challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like West Nile virus, influenza virus, norovirus, or other emerging viruses of the future.",""

Understanding the genes that control tolerance and resistance could provide new strategies to improve the health and welfare of livestock. Around one sixth of the world cattle population is estimated to be at risk from one of the most debilitating tick-borne diseases of cattle, caused by the protozoan parasite, Theileria annulata. The parasite mainly infects cells of the myeloid lineage which are also the main producers of inflammatory cytokines. If an infectious or inflammatory insult is sufficiently great, inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages enter the circulation and induce an acute phase proteins (APP) response. The Bos taurus Holstein breed produces higher and more prolonged levels of inflammatory cytokine induced APP than the Bos indicus Sahiwal breed in response to experimental infection with T. annulata. The Sahiwal exhibits significantly less pathology and survives infection, unlike the Holstein breed. Therefore, we hypothesised that the causal genes were likely to be expressed in macrophages and control the production of inflammatory cytokines. A functional genomics approach revealed that the transcriptome profile of the B. taurus macrophages was more associated with an inflammatory programme than the B. indicus macrophages. In particular the most differentially expressed gene was a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family. These are mainly expressed on myeloid cell surfaces and control inflammatory responses. Other differentially expressed genes included bovine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (BoLA) class II genes, particularly BoLA DQ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)B2. We are now exploring whether sequence and functional differences in the bovine SIRP family may underlie the resistance or tolerance to T. annulata between the breeds. Potentially, our research may also have more general implications for the control of inflammatory processes against other pathogens. Genes controlling the balance between pathology and protection may determine how livestock can survive in the face of infectious onslaught. Next generation sequencing and RNAi methodologies for livestock species will bring new opportunities to link diversity at the genome level to functional differences in health traits in livestock species.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05ebcf542e41e3918160353d0c5840ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0694caa8e3932fae365fabb88b8fd70d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a312eca12df0f7fad06d70d9d6ef9f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ae9edc23dabfcbcf3d01425fc9ffd52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/105012a291ed938edcad8f2a7375536c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f70ae080426138fb8bea58f2e2685e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2363c57c9ae560b87e4bfbbb9f078223, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26b434eaa00daad4ad8c983a92ab26a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c789b84c0b769d64bb72e58097f5cdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c8500edf4af15f85063c694d267ad8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ffe577669b7348829843bdd71341434, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/336bb894300150a2fd926a1e766ed90b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36507d61ebd655cfa817df58c7538711, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38a2f99118b94a067d642666a6308bbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b0f08adef37a275f5a9cad2c7b58ee3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44eb256678e88525d76fb0c6929fb169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4794f2ec4bc1bbfd586e5d53c1645cb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4de98a39b9538c76bac2a2bf02b9a9c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f04d2d162a191a2b8442ec27c2cd8fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51265d75421e481d0d57593f474dc1df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5169aaf229332a72aab10579129e9331, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f90bbbd8073391fa13e0cdab13d9bcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60d40a5ff58f24fe54de00a363c57620, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65e3a96df0bb1766c44a7dd815846d1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66eedfa57c66e550b6f230acc1603c12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6721c3bfe17f2b29392afbc5cf841852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7030a9814c4c0312860169e773f1a4c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7264dc1e4d46ca701ab8da139c396e66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7420a73073feb7ebf52db6ea2c314df7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/745957f7958434aed398b11e298b2e71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7509ec493cbcf948c984804e88cb14ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76b11d6798f236834d9300d381ab3443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/819629bfc681a729a9b39a15d9449312, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/855518e4c6e3c954272ea1ba2116d401, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85e140aed81f36ecacdbe993a8dae832, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/871545aef196e6aa04ea347f3282c4cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8842120333b38b1423a609b438f22aa5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8aa48283ee770739866e71d45ce5a018, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/906011f2418fe615daa72a0213587cfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99e68d92ed3bcbb9106c42744701f92e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1473ffea8034d96f64bee5247dfc6fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4029a8e7ebdbba8db6301d1cd83c9ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a44ef41582e198e18d2a400ca9ee4a80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a502a10959c8518f8643737c9b70b694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acba84f346a9fbc7daecb9a7ec825e1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad516cfeda41a6ccd6ed8e0db1d3e96c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd3ba48d7a45d617b815cda0af23eecb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c144815bc827c2b4e86880671d6fcada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbdc5e2afe9a68fbb508b4b8491a51fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d26f8971578d88e00d91a8e55c45d22d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dae6e44f257ae53e8506de7dc5847bd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db4dead2a61fbf663c6416e4f43d5b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd6c2dd0f751c8b6a27b749786620881, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee32b9d479bda6621a9f5107235cc136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4d05d53c16089a96e1723dec53e0c0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fac1ccf288811be52c6320a08932aaa0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcbed48b07e916b3ac533e62670b3378"

Polyethylenimine (PEI) is among the most efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors. Its efficiency and cytotoxicity depend on molecular weight, with the 25-kDa PEI being most efficient but cytotoxic. Smaller PEIs are noncytotoxic but less efficient. Enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity by cross-linking of small PEIs via potentially biodegradable linkages was explored herein. The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation’s effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity. Toward this goal, we carried out cross-linking of branched 2-kDa PEI and its 1:1 (w/w) mixture with a linear 423-Da PEI via ester- and/or amide-bearing linkages; the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiency, as well as toxicity to mammalian cells, of the resultant cross-linked polycations were investigated. METHODS. The efficiency of the cross-linked PEIs in delivering in vitro a plasmid containing β-galactosidase gene and their cytotoxicity were investigated in monkey kidney cells (COS-7). Dynamic light scattering was used to compare the relative DNA condensation efficiency of the unmodified and cross-linked PEIs. In vivo gene delivery efficiency was evaluated by intratracheal delivery in mice of the complexes of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and the PEIs and estimating the luciferase expression in the lungs. RESULTS. Cross-linking boosted the gene delivery efficiency of the small PEIs by 40- to 550-fold in vitro; the efficiency of the most potent conjugates even exceeded by an order of magnitude that of the branched 25-kDa PEI. Effective condensation of DNA was evident from the fact that the mean diameter of the complexes of the cross-linked PEIs was some 300 nm with a narrow size distribution, while the complexes of the unmodified small PEIs exhibited a mean size of >700 nm with a very broad size distribution. At concentrations where the 25-kDa PEI resulted in >95% cell death, the conjugates afforded nearly full cell viability. The cross-linked PEIs were 17 to 80 times m ore efficient than the unmodified ones in vivo; furthermore, their efficiencies were up to twice that of the 25-kDa PEI. CONCLUSIONS. Cross-linking of small PEIs with judiciously designed amide- and ester-bearing linkers boosts their gene delivery efficiency both in vitro and in vivo without increasing the cytotoxicity. The high efficiency is dependent on the nature of the linkages and the PEIs used.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/006574783783f2c730e15d47b6131027,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing a yeast product in milk replacer (MR) on growth and health of calves, and on fecal populations of some targeted microorganisms related to calf health and growth (i.e., total bacteria, Escherichia coli, Clostridium cluster XIVa, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium spp.). We hypothesized that feeding a Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii (SCB) product would improve gastrointestinal health and growth performance of calves. Forty-two Holstein bull calves (42.6±0.77kg at birth) were randomly assigned on day 2 of age to either a control or SCB treatment. The SCB was supplemented in MR and fed at 5g/d per head to supply 10 billion colony-forming units per day. All calves received high quality colostrum (>50mg/mL of immunoglobulin G) during the first 24h of life, and were fed with 8L MR (150g/L mixed with 40°C water) daily from day 2–35, and 4L daily from day 35–42. Calves were also fed calf starter ad libitum from day 7–56. Daily MR and starter offered and refused, daily fecal scores, nasal scores, ear scores, and weekly body weight of calves were recorded. Fecal samples were collected on day 7, 35 and 56 after the first feeding of that day for microbial targets analysis. Overall, there is no serious disease challenge for all the calves during the entire experimental period. No differences were observed in MR intake, starter intake, metabolizable energy (ME) intake, average daily gain, ME intake to gain ratio, fecal score, nasal score, eye score or any targeted microorganisms between treatments throughout the experiment. These results suggest that supplementing SCB in MR has no additive effects on animal growth or fecal biomarkers of gut health when calves do not show deteriorated health status.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cd2a65b3306f0d8ee1e775c0d5ad2d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2099403d41bb1a5bddf21e9935f96402, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/262503cd0769733f7c1ece8c24888079, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/272fd2e859176a306d6ff09f7039c130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b3f1d2f99551a07a9fd8bf5c427c6a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c09192f4492fb868af0a467a6432346, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34fe0020bbe50e6a5c3cce77d270529c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cdabab9c1d830f8bd64563b228a76b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4042b8733f9ac1019cdfca13f0274b17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a6056ccc434f004d46b1cd2a837d5fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ae13a51abe01e3a98b1ffcd608534a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ebaef18de36f42fc32c339a67f6c682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53ff38de0553bf6bf2adfaaf0c89dfc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58ae9f6769eec400cd8b823f0ab84b37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66ae5fcfc1ca6b54b8040e8d4cca17c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/691089bdaf5af70e028106eb4332ee3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c7f9e9d6ea788ff626e4840c6190a4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e4d26b1b24b2db5957a514a7aca135a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/729c7f8962fc49c689c6cff6c8d264e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f1858cfadf06272203861bcd275f65b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f753218b2d0f6ac0c23df84db80d977, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81321272bc3358c4cfc895538d2f2f30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81d79f5bd363b5f123d0a54397ff6849, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a02bbc7a66953716db33b8a300defea1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3ad14f2a5cd94fc0e371051f16a9493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aac1129ec2cfcff9926bc2edc328233a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4dab5085b0a751ca8a9367956cd22c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c87f744ba8a329c317db35fcea7eb3c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce5455f0cf920f1eced5db74362bed6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4529270c4c2be618a8844a8499126df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbecb0367a72d94bd0bfedaff10d6173, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4f9f0cbf61cca735e245e5c1ef19434, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e943c627c154c4a872634c3551cece84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb74e10253fb93380ee42c15c714f415"

In these cases, lncRNAs have been shown to be key regulators of several cellular processes. Therefore, there is a great need to understand the function of more lncRNAs and their regulation in response to stimuli. Interferon (IFN) is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response. IFN binding to its receptor activates transcription of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that function as potent antivirals. In addition, several ISGs are positive or negative regulators of the IFN pathway. This is essential to ensure a strong antiviral response and a later return of the cell to homeostasis. As the ISGs described to date are coding genes, we sought to determine whether IFN also regulates the expression of long non-coding ISGs. To this aim, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of control and HuH7 cells treated with IFNα2. The results show that IFN-treatment regulates the expression of several unknown non-coding transcripts. We have validated two lncRNAs upregulated after treatment with different doses of type I IFNα2 in different cells or with type III IFNλ. These lncRNAs were also induced by influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus mutants unable to block the IFN response, but not by several wild-type lytic viruses tested. These lncRNA genes were named lncISG15 and lncBST2 as they are located close to ISGs ISG15 and BST2, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition experiments showed that lncBST2 is a positive regulator of BST2. Therefore lncBST2 has been renamed BISPR, from BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator. Our results may have therapeutic implications as lncBST2/BISPR, but also lncISG15 and their coding neighbors, are increased in cells infected with hepatitis C virus and in the liver of infected patients. These results allow us to hypothesize that several lncRNAs could be activated by IFN to control the potency of the antiviral IFN response.",""

The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction. Mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus (RABV) strain HEP-Flury exhibited subtle clinical signs, and eventually recovered, which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4(+) T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00457ee94a7996b17e2304f0a767c3b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/009c1e5395d1cf8dea81d14b3fe64f5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/153d12f43b43c0e494fff2973b412ebe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fc5a54ea4d317e28eaf307f3f518384, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20a38892717a1576c84b6ab9fa57bb5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20bc74a813043aca5ba5d53a710c16bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a2e5d2b6c758be9e10182682190070d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b58778a07eb9d6443f56f6387c79f07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c5ba9e7d3164acf3e88bcbeb470c56c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30937ca1896067ca22220e98ff8fe8ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32fd5dcbec128dcc019820053d4e34cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3985debd424e7646ba4d34ac8e180cee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a6d23e3f7d966310a4764a2d66a6826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c837b5b219dd1c4a4ac832947c5a4ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45274e3792192b718e40a2b76626d231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/454b9e45aad68d93165580f181320e7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d52833eaf318eb0cadb3da05fcc12be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/566c8bceb922e0af855008f348a2d013, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dc016f5cce263920755321cff6d788a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72efe8b6448aa323d1721e7e2f0fc95f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73cacfc889e2c55c3c0550be71573c6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7412e415447d3d3f3ed24515bbb28454, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dd1f2d5277ee0c38b80b357d7eaa3ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f8f3b4c3b4d112b7254abd9393c589c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8057657d16f3d70ebb211349b4b8aea6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/842dc70da3b9639b984bfdbdb97e7f8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8680ee6e57a25c64a2cc3d7294057e07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/905520b73096422b7cccbedb0da300ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99e2d3a571490bbaff9ec08d1597731c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ccede0d3f91bc232bf46b99274ff119, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dc3610ea5f76e6c82c54508f21d7d1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7a1ee026f1db082721fef0759b858e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a82968401c65db05aacaa7004f12c9fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9baf1e52ed7b147ac23d16f0d4ec40d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af0e62ae48bbd8b632fb7d0b71326304, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9f6735b18616e284c080b18550a3c2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4d9dd50262db82f1038baa3407eafe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c69936e26d6c3a57c9dd766c223c9b70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdbef2c22912e2c4badcd01a9ab379b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6b2908a8fae34cc1fb9818870d8e190, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db002f0dada3d29399bc65ae863eea9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db3d0a34581e951d12c73734f21fcf39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db5884b12236edd7b37e770dadbec4d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de8f19e44990f894040b2ef89366b9cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfa0e582dda0c91d6a9436ac46f7a16f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0faa570ff129253535206e3a8855fad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e234ba6797e41c035e2baa7775261259, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5890ad5f1ea2c4958c034608cc33b1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6f8949dc9828b3e77040a73ec215e21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e94f0ba48e3d55ca6d81c3629a1d1ec6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee099c6a4623d6f1bde2b6c2dec65a57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef3f2627db5216ad6b9fe5ea2f49c6dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5c0c663685805c5ce6d175cb11c820f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe9bb8d2824d349d4a845e4fe03ba8ac"

This review discusses these various associations as they pertain to the development and exacerbation of asthma.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0171553cdde126260893dd478ec9d280, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01fe9985d58f93c76cf40a7b954e3c58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24cb8de7739973f23479c9f6b4d21275, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2567045ed55f87200a80ddfb79acea40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2633cf25bd1c811632c8ef4e1023aef5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c132c8cc67779918b96fe4238e48d78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4db71709dd6c8190495df3e71c08da4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65ebdeb09f4f05db4f8bd436c2c5ad58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b27b19fd4785ee361d7f4230b0dd09a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/829f97319c4f20923034530500c35b96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92c60234d9da29c34391966aadfe480e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c6c37171fb67141ee2b80e2a5b8ad46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1010f23c8c8779513d1a5f18370e53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b4b6e8050fbf2f6d00f6805e00d5a2"

On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen. We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models. We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice. MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans. We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200(−/−) mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro. In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling. However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females. Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection. Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00a13047c6a5b29a1ec6eea9054a2674, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/029aa0c11e6bc6fe24d7747cf534dc2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0677dfb1179fd334aec4f7e7ccfd1d46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11d5b7b57123c4514e8e51140608c32e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/121fe11a82521add74e80efd875b5d87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19e67eb052e5b11cd4666060fb71347f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bed02ab5bab19f9c8278daf2e7f7ea1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23232ed548a6c34454eb8d00d4e120c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/332fb45309dd8af08b2c548b1aea86ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3656e943a90ed893aa291cb1f79d5a19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39a4f8e19db3552c0c0ceef94a00844d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f33cefcefb00d23d0c67f9948264a52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42ef32c591872195d42a611a0b36f046, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/443fe9a42a316495129bb37ed7dce8e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f47ec557456419f2f6d9d7f0c61df05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54551ba3036bcd928c79d2f312db713b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dc87d6ced59ba819612f2331d239324, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/600516a76cfe155eaecf829a8ba0d415, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/629c3b8474b49247889c5714978b7ae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6df03b6c178e0eaceb553888751eb784, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74d005e912e766ca2a3d89f8db80d757, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a71e2e947aa5dd6f0cc7c20ba8cca62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/900fb964895e312bd93cf226d3394327, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/933f4aa57e1b1282b75f0fa9e43e0c29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9baacdb5397d02b920a90769b2676269, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a071cb74588b53e4949298b171bc4c83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a49780197ef86416c9c376be09b97a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8d5fe519eed7fe9a7611a4cb52d60f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b231110a101976e41375522a90c95f5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbb8b8ed87fb3d0323ed94c1b87e3ebd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbbc5ae60d6625cd2b91844a73d4d20e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbfd6142192358ca70ec9c86f3818b71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4156c2f20d3af564e7f0381bbec619d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c624c84f18ce014f29c009e9d38c5044, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca8f054d772a1e53aff11727051318e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd957591a95c41cfa96e964eae8dffb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9edfee9719b925eecfd0b46d4f8be7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e35dc8f3ac5be459e16c9e0de0b3cbd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8d201f6988be3bf3e83bf177967e6d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc60c3fdcdbb82c0170d3babc309a97b"

By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic β cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6–phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by ∼90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in β cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595–608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrin-coated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997. Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261–1271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR–ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05f4aed35f1aedf4332d54483073f94b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a8ef2067aba98fb629f258c82be0289, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0afd0a0f28e0483b3e9663b836c985d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/178d00abc8bd25e1fa81c548bcbc6ebc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/339107fe87ca71d7d6e889aebe8d5105, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3eea345f65fc712ef49766d8b3239c2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47bf3d00ba0df5faafac28e5fced13d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e0c7e2b27a5d3d7477b11526b16a767, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b20dcd883afc5d032deb86a5e0b0d26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60032d0db1d6d630c5abf2166bfb0bf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69e8bbc5bf7a3b47a6eafc51ee49fda6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fe2e176527f5d88e3850a500603acc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71900d9590035b5f649e7232dd55531f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/835d534d720e72f7bc74284768c9d991, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85ce9f2118234ca34adb73846babeeaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94f4b11f20ef9c0ec4c249aedf7aff62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95103b57b43dc81ef508cf25a4cd4f57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99cb106b7d62f063c8e0bc6f10c089c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1d5683ee46f75818c91c63ce57faf5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a58dec68775b25e4d5a690a466b2a8f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8625f39bcda82b7ee00734682024f25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2b5ddbae0855c366c349d8425189910, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf6cf990a14edca90cc4d13bcf467889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9e63018fc6f26fef097f8abcc8909c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9e8ef8d8fa5dce0e03495057c2e8303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db8966755f25ae4f7b79a902f5b63843, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0edc3d5225bb418bd4c9aae3cbd9c7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e44f10346da7312a00d4fd684529ea53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed69f035aad79b623dc8f185392ee2b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5f2761fffec6c86de74dcc0c27054d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa4e517ab292de4ad27e0bf748af93ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc3a837fb6b53b7369328622887e7ad3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd668c415ad0ebc1a0c17b74b4593f4c"

However, research has shown that many PH information needs are unmet. In addition to reviewing relevant literature, this study performed a comprehensive review of existing information resources and collected data from two representative PH groups, focusing on identifying current practices, expressed information needs, and ideal systems for information access. METHODS: Nineteen individual interviews were conducted among employees of two domains in a state health department – communicable disease control and community health promotion. Subsequent focus groups gathered additional data on preferences for methods of information access and delivery as well as information format and content. Qualitative methods were used to identify themes in the interview and focus group transcripts. RESULTS: Informants expressed similar needs for improved information access including single portal access with a good search engine; automatic notification regarding newly available information; access to best practice information in many areas of interest that extend beyond biomedical subject matter; improved access to grey literature as well as to more systematic reviews, summaries, and full-text articles; better methods for indexing, filtering, and searching for information; and effective ways to archive information accessed. Informants expressed a preference for improving systems with which they were already familiar such as PubMed and listservs rather than introducing new systems of information organization and delivery. A hypothetical ideal model for information organization and delivery was developed based on informants' stated information needs and preferred means of delivery. Features of the model were endorsed by the subjects who reviewed it. CONCLUSION: Many critical information needs of PH practitioners are not being met efficiently or at all. We propose a dual strategy of: 1) promoting incremental improvements in existing information delivery systems based on the expressed preferences of the PH users of the systems and 2) the concurrent development and rigorous evaluation of new models of information organization and delivery that draw on successful resources already operating to deliver information to clinical medical practitioners.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14dc3755d4e5f41ba1222a2b0396889c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24c4b14dff2b51df3edf197f03ec591f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f18122560a19c166c0c3fc1d3806443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/757cfd950bf2f1c97ff5f7e8ac69f480"

We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the 2013–2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1 sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a298ccaf0e43e56a7c987f2034469e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38a82f8d7ccc972b8b74ddf3b39cce69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/422f2dddc88bd73d237f4dfeed79a543, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96122bee09ee74d77ce326b09c140b52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bed711df306d74fea9000a7e50145e4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6984d2a4a5a130520d7d473388390b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7aa22b82cbab1eb8cdac96041222bb4"

It is hypothesized that a suboptimal innate immune response is responsible for the disease pathogenesis. In the study presented here we tested this hypothesis and identified several nonstructural proteins (NSPs) with innate immune evasion properties encoded by the PRRS viral genome. Four of the total ten PRRSV NSPs tested were found to have strong to moderate inhibitory effects on beta interferon (IFN-β) promoter activation. The strongest inhibitory effect was exhibited by NSP1 followed by, NSP2, NSP11, and NSP4. We focused on NSP1α and NSP1β (self-cleavage products of NSP1 during virus infection) and NSP11, three NSPs with strong inhibitory activity. All of three proteins, when expressed stably in cell lines, strongly inhibited double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) signaling pathways. NSP1β was found to inhibit both IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)- and NF-κB-dependent gene induction by dsRNA and Sendai virus. Mechanistically, the dsRNA-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were strongly inhibited by NSP1β. Moreover, when tested in a porcine myelomonocytic cell line, NSP1β inhibited Sendai virus-mediated activation of porcine IFN-β promoter activity. We propose that this NSP1β-mediated subversion of the host innate immune response plays an important role in PRRSV pathogenesis.",""

When MERS-CoV was first identified, the closest related virus was in bats; however, it has since been recognized that dromedary camels serve as a virus reservoir and potential source for human infections. A total of 376 camels were screened for MERS-Cov at a live animal market in the Eastern Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, UAE. In all, 109 MERS-CoV-positive camels were detected in week 1, and a subset of positive camels were sampled again weeks 3 through 6. A total of 126 full and 3 nearly full genomes were obtained from 139 samples. Spike gene sequences were obtained from 5 of the 10 remaining samples. The camel MERS-CoV genomes from this study represent 3 known and 2 potentially new lineages within clade B. Within lineages, diversity of camel and human MERS-CoV sequences are intermixed. We identified sequences from market camels nearly identical to the previously reported 2015 German case who visited the market during his incubation period. We described 10 recombination events in the camel samples. The most frequent recombination breakpoint was the junctions between ORF1b and S. Evidence suggests MERS-CoV infection in humans results from continued introductions of distinct MERS-CoV lineages from camels. This hypothesis is supported by the camel MERS-CoV genomes sequenced in this study. Our study expands the known repertoire of camel MERS-CoVs circulating on the Arabian Peninsula.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/086b808ab2cd7043f0944b0f7e992e0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17722e8e38c9424a23be0163e06eec78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a48fa3ab9e000fc40c12494aff1413d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b8ec336f994ebd7e63e4b3ab93a589b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49b4e9c8b5707b597a855eb0d3655e5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ad0348b296219a9ee43abd0772ca32e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/515115dcc23891b8908ea08655211ec3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53d65342138fd50152d003093ed276c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58dce8d7152e501465e5c61c1170ffc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b656011dccd41cfd0f275e912afe738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5be879b8377e9052ce333829d66b7a34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6837c6e6ffe9ad2b58a6ca53accd8bc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a0b7a3011a69e9a4ef835ab567e3cff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bd7d1d3d4c6c39034ae6560926faf30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87c852cc38083af4100f7085e34682aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9462d766db39ff5a661cd70172405c8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c0067e749f68d775709cfef680e1244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fb11d5ff80bd4b49c650db4f7e64ea0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a052eaed7ab12e4a81c30894b057c310, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b61d84c01c94398845a141ed8909d6b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b828ded3141b6be0308cb3a1e88b8e2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcdf0f3f8abdf5619811bab51ce1bf71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c11c9344169bcd5a6915d318f20e9aa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2d452659390ec092ccd79e09c651982, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7befe6b5ceba9656c84b8764759076b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caa5009787836974c72db73fcd44675b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d551932a80be448019ec6c2207becd12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8459fecc7214e8cd05bff6d712145dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db42a2951211dbedd1bc5405668ddec0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de19199eb173cf25efab40fabfdee4b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6edacef88df8dfde4b2d1580c70772c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb86226c6facfbdfd5c5a73c95efec7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed3c4704226f9b47ff55b859279a8210"

HBoV genomic DNA is frequently detected in both ill and healthy children. We hypothesized that spliced viral capsid messenger RNA (mRNA) produced during active replication might be a better marker for acute infection. METHODS: As part of the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, children aged <18 years who were hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and children asymptomatic at the time of elective outpatient surgery (controls) were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens were tested for HBoV mRNA and genomic DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: HBoV DNA was detected in 10.4% of 1295 patients with CAP and 7.5% of 721 controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.0–2.0]); HBoV mRNA was detected in 2.1% and 0.4%, respectively (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.6–26]). When adjusted for age, enrollment month, and detection of other respiratory viruses, HBoV mRNA detection (adjusted OR, 7.6 [95% CI, 1.5–38.4]) but not DNA (adjusted OR, 1.2 [95% CI, .6–2.4]) was associated with CAP. Among children with no other pathogens detected, HBoV mRNA (OR, 9.6 [95% CI, 1.9–82]) was strongly associated with CAP. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of HBoV mRNA but not DNA was associated with CAP, supporting a pathogenic role for HBoV in CAP. HBoV mRNA could be a useful target for diagnostic testing.",""

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm O3 in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the O3 preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17358173200cf87d800d450f340318a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18e1f2654f3f449b68cd84bb95917e50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27f5db74a0de63157cc9618473e9f83c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/304c2c7e52a176cdd15db2cec6948dfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32caa8c50474682c8909d9b873d0c688, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/346019828d46b50157d50580401a5966, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4604b4b5a940c31899d3875d6dfffad5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d9b46ef87215a2f8d483615771902de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688b498a6d079998074c070e6fbde709, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f21d888d9b6db609bd2b3ccae559e2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/979156aa532a2e34a53e5676c7619be8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7fd92051591aab5166ed195ccd4c49d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b68cd570ac47f406b5274363106466f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba61d0e87ddd84ff6b60524da9768f47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bae661c36ae80fb9295a7ab550c89f40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5478dc90c7d8f602badab89cc5c2e3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6c8bf5fc3775cb82a02d11273efb25b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c809d81d7f2284d4d95a49a69d12f2ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccc04d6389a1a5ff853c4e2f668e180a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce751cb606fe4ac1df08128e7ad4885e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1e6a1e2639d7f2bb1bc32d402b49a68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db3d34228f298e281da54da4fa134dd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f795ce521923e502a2dd0ba8b7f7164a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb3fcdcd9648c240ff60ccc702cabdbf"

This hypothesis implies that factors in the environment can determine the initiation of allergic sensitization and can potentially influence the clinical manifestations and severity of disease. Because the prevalence of atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy have increased worldwide in the past several decades, and there is no mechanism for changes in population genetics over this short period of time, changes in the human environment are most likely responsible for these trends. From this line of reasoning, it follows that if the factors responsible for the increasing prevalence can be identified, then there would be an opportunity to develop strategies to reverse these trends. It also would be helpful to identify infants who are at risk for developing allergy, so that preventive strategies could be used most effectively. In this article, studies to determine the contributions of genetics and the environment to the development of allergic diseases in childhood are explored.

Coexpression of either S or E protein with human α-, β-, and γ-ENaC in Xenopus oocytes led to significant decreases of both amiloride-sensitive Na(+) currents and γ-ENaC protein levels at their plasma membranes. S and E proteins decreased the rate of ENaC exocytosis and either had no effect (S) or decreased (E) rates of endocytosis. No direct interactions among SARS-CoV E protein with either α- or γ-ENaC were indentified. Instead, the downregulation of ENaC activity by SARS proteins was partially or completely restored by administration of inhibitors of PKCα/β1 and PKCζ. Consistent with the whole cell data, expression of S and E proteins decreased ENaC single-channel activity in oocytes, and these effects were partially abrogated by PKCα/β1 inhibitors. Finally, transfection of human airway epithelial (H441) cells with SARS E protein decreased whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents. These findings indicate that lung edema in SARS infection may be due at least in part to activation of PKC by SARS proteins, leading to decreasing levels and activity of ENaC at the apical surfaces of lung epithelial cells.",""

We previously identified a bulged stem-loop secondary structure at the upstream end of the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the genome of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This element, beginning immediately downstream of the nucleocapsid gene stop codon, was shown to be essential for virus replication. Other investigators discovered an adjacent downstream pseudoknot in the 3′ UTR of the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This pseudoknot was also shown to be essential for replication, and it has a conserved counterpart in every group 1 and group 2 coronavirus. In MHV and BCoV, the bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot are, in part, mutually exclusive, because of the overlap of the last segment of the stem-loop and stem 1 of the pseudoknot. This led us to hypothesize that they form a molecular switch, possibly regulating a transition occurring during viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed an extensive genetic analysis of the two components of this proposed switch. Our results define essential and nonessential components of these structures and establish the limits to which essential parts of each element can be destabilized prior to loss of function. Most notably, we have confirmed the interrelationship of the two putative switch elements. Additionally, we have identified a pseudoknot loop insertion mutation that appears to point to a genetic interaction between the pseudoknot and a distant region of the genome.",""

Previous studies have shown that FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of FIC5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis. It also have been reported that FIC5.9 cannot be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear. METHODS: We formulated a hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by enzymes that are activated by post-blood collection and may be coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen in healthy blood. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that thrombin acts as an initiator for FIC5.9 releasing, and that mainly plasmin cleaves N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and neutrophil elastase cleave C-terminal end of FIC5.9.

CFPHV has also been detected recently by PCR in tissue samples from clinically healthy (non exhibiting fibropapilloma tumours) turtles, thus representing presumably latent infections of the pathogen. Given that template copy numbers of viruses in latent infections can be very low, extremely sensitive PCR assays are needed to optimize detection efficiency. In this study, efficiency of several PCR assays designed for CFPHV detection is explored and compared to a method published previously. The results show that adoption of a triplet set of singleplex PCR assays outperforms other methods, with an approximately 3-fold increase in detection success in comparison to the standard assay. Thus, a new assay for the detection of CFPHV DNA markers is presented, and adoption of its methodology is recommended in future CFPHV screens among sea turtles.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/117037146407ee73ae8356a04e20f5d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b553e73677a8360afbe1477cb29f83e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26e557a87701ee33a313c56790930b83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f5dbd42caa455e40f882f244e1e7932, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5632eea42989bed5a017c5f064d49a75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/622f5e38d5d482b0132a78b4556c9d39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64d7db058dcaecbf211d530b586a50c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a2309a3d01c868957b435a91996f5f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c58201c7791681e7c4ce6133e06fb6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86ebc6ef4a1e6076f98fdb8edc006a00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88f71bb1aea01afa7c10020580a74215, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95da1f749254cac690a9904587199685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cb1fb0a6b02864aeca2e3875d38e5a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7685f8f47403971f127d56f1db3112a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8c0c0480831d60035e3578517cc6b65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3881da30044dcaeb8006457a74e74b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f007562c28fb5d6cd4ddb8191ccc1cf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f33877bcbf051221f828d95e30f972a3"

Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 °C was similar to that at 37 °C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine. These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02fc31ddf9ce7fd79ddb65651ee9ba0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/031136855509763cbe2986808720a812, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/074b2303794a393418ae9f53806114e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c43e2fc44377a6abaad15fceee1569f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e56e3f98dd2ddead5f90664cfa618d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f6eea38cca9f87eeaace398b71ba30a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/165bfe41b628bfc4e8c91f3b1dea07cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18dfaa6eff3dd9dd2c2d4bebe3bc4dc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20909637f56184edaa1c6d9fe4e47874, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20a9c6eb797ffe403d14ba3e395f9d5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2174ef6384d24820939c65116fbddd19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22a4ddd370bcff16572fabbfe738ac9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24ae0ec3dc984c3aa523c0f274ee7930, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28539372eb8cf63f5158522f8e651581, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29ff12fa733255db05dcdbaffe96e160, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3330f8c61b591842036f282094442912, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38b2a9ba11282f9cd55002316672e36a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ab4228eba766417f65836b3c7e138aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cf645b392af3a55e07766e7ed7f6be4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/474e5f8c4a5e34191a69e7c80b36db3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47ac5a5cbff73abbd31ecb9cde13d378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51b8c9be617d501025c06b777bf0ddcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/625b8e129cbfa7c5966afe80d58379aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64b38a2918d0312a187d1c9fd5031e0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/651f0f835aeedc4c92e0aec7cf2f466d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6deda754c9f1b5c22fa8e2d88151c81a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7473b1dc2f5da1f4064981122bf0c2d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/770c0385ad4b89ca6510a5a85fea9c70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79a47217d51c4074faa43e04707ba754, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ddbf59e22872f69c2d22cec134069bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e016a02e32ad62ba605e37ddbd54d20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81dfffaccc932ea36a890ec24f2d2058, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a59bc2ff5189c98c59f0587ab0e63b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92da22b681d7a22418439d18ba1c97bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a05b4ddeb3f5ee611dca0108f2558c71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abf7b9a295cd80f47921706954ac5ca1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aee8a5cfcb7aac10ee955e9db422c909, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b830b0b2ebf0bf25858d6b85f290e640, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb04c1fc2f6e5ad7c95120112833bff4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd13a5fc660743a804e41d82d55ef3e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1becaa51a7e806d6c0e6180fafc08fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c92075fca7084e8d0214eb1be702ac53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d48e49f43c925e2b4cc50c9ec2ffe9cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9ac91068667e77696ac68901753cc40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da05160eec042038dc277fd1ebeac87b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db52c5317bcbbadacd3d3f09154c12a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d0914b62e587ebd1a3185de6de90f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9c55a8362fc76ce018ee527e53a7898, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2aca388496a32886805d2c387dbb852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa21381555ba2eba781036432bbeda1e"

One of the hypotheses to explain the induction or the maintenance of VZV latency is that it could be promoted by the immune response itself. It is known that in the case of viruses which bud off the infected cell membrane, virus-specific antibodies can induce antigenic modulation, i.e., spatial redistribution of viral antigens and modulation of their synthesis. To determine whether antigenic modulation occurs during VZV infection in vitro and could possibly be involved in viral persistence, we have grown infected cells in the presence of anti-VZV antibodies either transiently or permanently. The distribution of immune complexes and viral proteins was then analyzed. In transient immunomodulation experiments, the distribution of one or more viral antigens was modified not only in the cytoplasmic membranes but also in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of infected cells. When infected cells were kept permanently in the presence of antibodies, the same pattern of redistribution of immune complexes was observed and the localization of internal viral glycoproteins was significantly modified. However, antibodies did not prevent the lytic effect of infection; they altered neither the infectious virus yield nor the Western immunoblot pattern of viral proteins, suggesting that immunomodulation is not the primary effector of viral persistence.",""

Our previous studies have shown that a candidate SARS vaccine antigen consisting of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike protein can induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals. To optimize expression conditions for scale-up production of the RBD vaccine candidate, we hypothesized that this could be potentially achieved by removing glycosylation sites in the RBD protein. In this study, we constructed two RBD protein variants: 1) RBD193-WT (193-aa, residues 318–510) and its deglycosylated forms (RBD193-N1, RBD193-N2, RBD193-N3); 2) RBD219-WT (219-aa, residues 318–536) and its deglycosylated forms (RBD219-N1, RBD219-N2, and RBD219-N3). All constructs were expressed as recombinant proteins in yeast. The purified recombinant proteins of these constructs were compared for their antigenicity, functionality and immunogenicity in mice using alum as the adjuvant. We found that RBD219-N1 exhibited high expression yield, and maintained its antigenicity and functionality. More importantly, RBD219-N1 induced significantly stronger RBD-specific antibody responses and a higher level of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice than RBD193-WT, RBD193-N1, RBD193-N3, or RBD219-WT. These results suggest that RBD219-N1 could be selected as an optimal SARS vaccine candidate for further development.",""

MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFNβ) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFNβ in bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0332873bd2376b933e57bd14d3846b43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/043fff46e94c1065e0c79278897395b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09966450525e73d7681b106ce43bb111, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d85764c8dbd458ba027a6d77cbe4168, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b40c3adaa4d9f015aeaaff71cb0d8f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1eeab543814e5733ae83736fd0410c9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/276c994f377b5181fac17d130c9d613b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/285337cbde2cd23d0a8b414903a69c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2de4ebf3675b12f709e19290c0cd45f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30b8cb66de110ad076672557b1a8bd6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cf674f99008d4c84461ee11b027bd04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46191b6a647f3505a2984f0faaab7e93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49b67b1e0ef1c1d643a7139e7c07872b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d334665a09dcce1561da24b2f323416, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52982baf6d2f97147dff8ba06146b037, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ac7fb249dfcd0fc728b366f508bc7ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62016b65444042d3103f75e072a3eb2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62c504652f8cc9231952455f9d3836b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/873b3aff999ee35c197cd6a0ce9fef0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8caee7edc1b9c4b84e13b6ba22b46726, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e5df961f8ce2a3b3489362227a17da9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f072fa4b784a40e50fbcec4f3d0ef28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/970502c151b55759c016a2e2ecd1f431, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a2ef86da0349ddcc12e8956feec19e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cfbc1147eaac705e7214498f0746778, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e3a317ca7e9afc881f4f75abff79ff8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a44d94d378d270eac0a0b0512af11513, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af4c6cf594127d31170b5616b227f210, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afdfcd7faedb84eb8c18d4f814b5b777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be646db45a32b2cb498f6352abdbfe7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c109aad876ae4404ed8afce626fac889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2abd71cceeff986de19e1e02a72c557, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddee8d2aad6662c5993bedbc7c802104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2768cf01a302d6695a916cfbce49317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3f9fd7fcd20bee694fd36664b9b0372, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e510a90747f19d003e41864bcf4ceba3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3ca3ff4a9d58b984202d3c5f194c9f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f95af502935d4f16395622b3033ce296, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa5f76d3ac771c483eb128aa19ed1192, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd04332480d3d350ba49923cf7de30e7"

The profile of specific antibodies to individual proteins of the virus is critical to the development of vaccine and diagnostic tools. In this study, 13 recombinant proteins associated with four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) and five putative uncharacterized proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a and 9b) of the SARS-CoV were prepared and used for screening and monitoring their specific IgG antibodies in SARS patient sera by protein microarray. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent-phase SARS patients, whereas those to proteins E, M, 3b, 6 and 7a were undetected. In the detectable specific antibodies, anti-S and anti-N were dominant and could persist in the sera of SARS patients until week 30. Among the rabbit antisera to recombinant proteins S3, N, 3a and 9b, only anti-S3 serum showed significant neutralizing activity to the SARS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells. The results suggest (1) that anti-S and anti-N antibodies are diagnostic markers and in particular that S3 is immunogenic and therefore is a good candidate as a subunit vaccine antigen; and (2) that, from a virus structure viewpoint, the presence in some human sera of antibodies reacting with two recombinant polypeptides, 3a and 9b, supports the hypothesis that they are synthesized during the virus cycle.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09e1c89114fb5eb0207b9f35c999448d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1417e85bc5e35eedb577e1054d9b48b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1684cb435463faa4b97cb806eb3f5f80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17b4b452401feb1fbbe33cc614b024a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1884bf7335686abc3f01fc4bfe24dd70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b5ade2c58fcd53ff4d10f6b10a05bf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bfcf3f0e8d3e3735b82096b806adf32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21b63bed67a8ffbe90e55ca10adaedb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ac766107048f5a39b6e8e621e8ec638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/303b097d2cc7190968842b9fc3193c04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32cafe9cc871e153698ec67a0dc3de4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33b75741a7682eeaa65ca0c8807668b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38789bbcf8d4bbdb1f276ccfedd7e422, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f634c6f45068c85b16c125215ed75a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4de837be9d24aadb33236451f96c1ea2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/545913193a17c72b8f2bdf0c68dbb550, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57276e76a4fa60e906886e11b6b5580f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/576a837e6db5320558f8d3ac91fa3a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e7ee225f1bb0e187680a475d60c39c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68a3c4055dc496a682882bf634238c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b39c823ce3b4e7fb863ab93e7b7c780, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fcbd38322d4fb00327b7fb72502fd13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80f7a8e9466cfb12bc10a6711c5a8e6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81846afbf8735d297efaebf28228823c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/962302849fb2da670af54aac135633b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4e3d0c66d4d0673bbffed055f7a245b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af390c167f18855dc96bf3c4587a86db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b84d8ab117e66f0d19318d939086cb5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb2c40f28889cc2d32d842bed945ffb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1e952b73c40dfa0ab2ed5f75ea424ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9d800df38faf7a5da7a7a3b226d9e76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb00843d479073d029002d7a20be2af6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd1a8b28b5c4dfac9db3fb39252fdcab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3a87c5432aafb138a07fc3b75edd474, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd0e2f5ea34c2c4f8806fd26cb6efc5f"

Beyond their direct functions, they also serve as scaffolds to support the association of proteins involved in structural support, adhesion, and transport. Unfortunately, biological processes sometimes malfunction and require therapeutic intervention. For those processes which occur within or upon membranes, it is oftentimes difficult to study the mechanism in a biologically relevant, membranous environment. Therefore, the identification of direct therapeutic targets is challenging. In order to overcome this barrier, engineering strategies offer a new approach to interrogate biological activities at membrane interfaces by analyzing them through the principles of the interfacial sciences. Since membranes are complex biological interfaces, the development of simplified model systems which mimic important properties of membranes can enable fundamental characterization of interaction parameters for such processes. We have selected the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model viral pathogen to demonstrate how model membrane platforms can aid antiviral drug discovery and development. Responsible for generating the genomic diversity that makes treating HCV infection so difficult, viral replication represents an ideal step in the virus life cycle for therapeutic intervention. To target HCV genome replication, the interaction of viral proteins with model membrane platforms has served as a useful strategy for target identification and characterization. In this review article, we demonstrate how engineering approaches have led to the discovery of a new functional activity encoded within the HCV nonstructural 5A protein. Specifically, its N-terminal amphipathic, α-helix (AH) can rupture lipid vesicles in a size-dependent manner. While this activity has a number of exciting biotechnology and biomedical applications, arguably the most promising one is in antiviral medicine. Based on the similarities between lipid vesicles and the lipid envelopes of virus particles, experimental findings from model membrane platforms led to the prediction that a range of medically important viruses might be susceptible to rupturing treatment with synthetic AH peptide. This hypothesis was tested and validated by molecular virology studies. Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the AH peptide has been identified against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and dengue virus, and many more deadly pathogens. As a result, the AH peptide is the first in class of broad-spectrum, lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents, and has entered the drug pipeline. In summary, engineering strategies break down complex biological systems into simplified biomimetic models that recapitulate the most important parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous for membrane-associated biological processes because model membrane platforms provide more direct characterization of target interactions than is possible with other methods. Consequently, model membrane platforms hold great promise for solving important biomedical problems and speeding up the translation of biological knowledge into clinical applications.",""

We hypothesized that structural changes of the lung might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. To answer this question, we correlate findings of high-resolution CT (HRCT) with dyspnea scores and results of pulmonary function tests in patients during recovery from SARS. Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Nineteen patients who recovered from SARS-related hospitalization. Measurements: The study included HRCT scores (0 to 100), dyspnea scores (1 to 4), static and dynamic lung volumes, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco). Results: The interval between hospital discharge and HRCT study or functional assessment was 31.2 ± 4.8 days (range, 25 to 38 days) [mean ± SD]. All patients had HRCT abnormalities and were assigned to two groups: ground-glass opacity (GGO) only (n = 7, 36.8%) and GGO with fibrosis (GGO+F) [n = 12, 63.2%]. Most patients (16 of 19, 84.2%) had no zonal predominance. HRCT scores correlated well with dyspnea scores (r = 0.78, p < 0.01) and with a variety of pulmonary functional variables, with Dlco being the most significant (r = − 0.923, p < 0.001). Compared with the GGO group, the GGO+F group showed significantly lower FEV1, FVC, total lung capacity, residual volume, and Dlco. Conclusions: HRCT findings correlate well with functional studies and clinical symptoms during recovery from SARS. Longer-term follow-up studies in a larger cohort of patients should be performed to investigate the clinical outcome of recovered SARS patients.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06d73de5828724fda4577ecb5c232697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/118d8cd92fbf86b8419485bc3ba5c06c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15654d9b6c1346e6a27c5285fa7e22c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15b471392d77e6852be6b6e1e9250026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b34a08e3f46b4806ccc5f27ad92d537, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e7e5d056c98f7db983e723811f2ab69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/214209c53aa498a8c657bad8880c6ca5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24d81af852874718fdb1e7eee552742c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29795747609a3e52200ee271b6719a56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ab359b793407f0b34acaaa10db282ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32346f2aebb8a52fbe2283aa3c09793a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35df2eb11f22974752726a4d8687f487, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36edb1bcbe779b439103cc2991448d5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46675dbfef6a877684044ed0a309a25f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a523b3948cf9e0b8c7a979d61b53c61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ad566213965d76d5a531200f91ef8df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bb395f8dcf3c47321b38df084487d21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/632378b4416533d58460d3c334b69acc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c0f87a1f325aab3f37177ad33949abf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/740106e45ff044a1ef4e6298373e477c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7615d995a705f2296736c4baf6e28e10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e9def16855560288aa8c1e7cefefe12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80e8514de6002c6767b5a6283b0c5058, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8976823d0bc92b80d28ca7c9046a6bca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ff3ec0678b22cd9d2bae95d92367e2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a85b1497a928e0e6e2c61e6cc98a1317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9f09cbb942589e0f20e037056b8d42e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b954ca347a05f712a29c2d6d46b4343a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6495fa881c18095b56aeb11148d3739, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb56c46ac685e15aded3fc23e47da31c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc2713263251c2efd5fc34e9681edb7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd4d9a52f47aceb6bd02cd9074fed08e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d217f38a7c3a75bee345986a87498cc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2d770f01a0933a10de01ffc8768a136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e126256f9f6b30208a4acc0f02375c91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e983e3836115fc2ebdb52dc52862f0d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0c1db15ab3084b89a2bc1d18c4748dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb71383abfd63fbd4e196aae5c103a22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe4a73cb76dca7af19e5b98162fbdf07"

Recent studies have shown that peptides delivered by the mucosal routes also stimulate local and systemic immune responses. Since mucosal delivery is easier to administer and more cost-effective when compared to gene-gun delivery, we were interested to learn whether mucosally-delivered peptides would prime protective immunity comparable to that of gene-gun delivered DNA in rabbits. Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model was used to test the hypothesis. We chose an HLA-A2.1 restricted cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) E1 epitope (E1/303–311, MLQEKPFQL) for the peptide immunization studies because it provided complete protection when used as a DNA vaccine. Adjuvant has been widely used to boost immunity for vaccines. In this study, three adjuvants reported to be effective for rabbits (TT helper motif, PADRE and CpG2007) were tested with the peptide vaccine. Peptide alone or fused to TT helper or PADRE to create chimeric peptides was delivered by two mucosal routes (ocular and intranasal) together. Partial protection was found in HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits when peptide was delivered mucosally in the presence of adjuvant. When a subsequent booster of a half dose of the corresponding DNA vaccine was delivered, complete protections were achieved. We conclude that mucosal peptide immunization can be combined with a single DNA vaccination to provide strong protective immunity in rabbits.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04df5a6ebfdf79c1d242165651c28910, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b42de991208afc7410b597d8b134ed8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1da85e0f37c88cdb2a8ff036cc82679f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2779f87bb8b4a2c08e81d282441cbe6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/281ad60ab75b1f4f7345efc3fffeb1ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c88fae8ed9d4dc7f6c94e2a5e63c003, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3186a43666dc60ec2e1819519fc35cd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33720ff4743ab82bf9b4275ae04d0a1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d61af2f01dba40a1bc505204c4bbbeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3df8c72fa8f17f2711bda38019715b5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4287749b6ab307c7f4311a91b346cddc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cec6f4bd67ad0014a1a9cbefcb1af29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51790bafe56eaab6d9d266cc02c0d384, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51eb9f136c2c97298328dfa6c400a872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ff99be6c6710d6f7ab4eb69043fdea1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/753c2c5b03eb184660892a5f5b76047a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/775b3c266402bcb66ebe2001b0444051, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79d8e3345e60eb954f95e931aefb5017, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8369c9192d7c26be1cfcb96efd7071a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87158da96bbb2d54803481b56032fc9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a25a47bc66e2a01454269838b08ef66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/901a0db86a6b7c81f23598749257f0aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96f109faac1910a22a46658481fdb84a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a3d3f6d3f8fa044cc66bf59ae8cb01c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a02c2fe5714ed88c63733dfa6eb6edc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a03104d6b49e50b8e7f53c687f7e3c0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3a992e89f5b0ca405639d73a9e1d5de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2975fab4389f7e2d8dac74880b4a9f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d60290fd1149320b9a06512f2e1248da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d717e1bf811aedf75b30433d2fcc1037, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d925e0c6d81a4c5f2130e51ef0b11339, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3e162687fa51cc63dc7c8dcab51637b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4dc7b6f310b15ed7a522addea619fa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb59cc6f0b52705e08d419e8ea5cfa3a"

This is resulting in a growing demand for alternative approaches to designing and evaluating interventions in complex systems. Theory of Change (ToC) is an approach which may be useful because it enables stakeholders to present and test their theories and assumptions about why and how impact may occur, ideally within an environment conducive to iterative reflection and learning. However, ToC is yet to be appropriately mainstreamed into development by donors, researchers and practitioners. We carried out a literature review, triangulated by interviews with 26 experts in African and Asian food security, consisting of researchers, advisors to programs, and donors. Although 17 (65%) of the experts had adopted ToC, their responses and the literature revealed four challenges to mainstreaming: (i) different interpretations of ToC; (ii) incoherence in relationships among the constituent concepts of ToC; (iii) confused relationships between ToC and project “logframes”; and (iv) limitations in necessary skills and commitment for enacting ToC. A case study of the evolution of a ToC in a West African AR4D project over 4 years which exemplified these challenges is presented. Five recommendations arise to assist the mainstreaming of ToC: (i) select a type of ToC suited to the relative complexity of the problem and focal system of interest; (ii) state a theory or hypotheses to be tested as the intervention progresses; (iii) articulate the relationship between the ToC and parallel approaches (e.g. logframe); (iv) accept that a ToC is a process, and (v) allow time and resources for implementers and researchers to develop ToC thinking within projects. Finally, we suggest that communities of practice should be established among AR4D and donor organisations to test, evaluate and improve the contribution that ToCs can make to sustainable food security and agricultural development.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08a65797e988a25afd7303bf164ad8b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d3e3ea57f8c3529d1fb213fe0fdfde6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21737dd35f255274e354a7b5ee25691d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/243fff31f02ed0620f915e3b738268a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47a2ce3437b16940c5d70cb7f18fdcf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ab5f1fb73a1b4722a12ebaceeaf3813, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ac2f9f72892690de3f13867fcd87a1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d33f9e1b5e16a62b91c49fa23a800c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d8faf8f85b4ec710a18458903d8862, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb2882aa2a8d50e4ae12d8b8af6c7ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6f9b1e7a550b35288f3f396d67346c5"

We hypothesized that ACE2 is part of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its expression regulated by the other elements of this system. ACE2 immuno-staining was performed in transgenic mouse brain sections from NSE-AT(1A) (overexpressing AT (1A) receptors), R(+)A(+) (overexpressing angiotensinogen, and renin) and control (non transgenic littermates) mice. Results show that ACE2 staining is widely distributed throughout the brain. Using cell type-specific antibodies, we observed that ACE2 staining is present in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies but not in glial cells. In the subfornical organ, an area lacking the blood brain barrier and sensitive to blood borne angiotensin-II, ACE2 was significantly increased in transgenic mice. Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated in the nucleus of tractus solitarius/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral medulla, when comparing transgenic to non-transgenic mice. These results suggest that ACE2 is localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain, and that ACE2 levels appear highly regulated by other components of the RAS, confirming its involvement in this system. Moreover, ACE2 expression in brain structures involved in the control of cardiovascular function suggests that the carboxypeptidase may have a role in the central regulation of blood pressure and diseases involving the autonomic nervous system such as hypertension.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03632e21aa3f71d9234d1cb65faaa8eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05bf3b81181e35e7cc64a3ce44786177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10b6d22158467d7668ea4d6c765789d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11b39ad5d1166e4443dbbe025b244c8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/171d6168379b7da5f54af1550d069c82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ab002e4fdeef85ebfd9334e806add36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d3fd18ecd66033e32d451fa9c613ac0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25988294ed978516d4e87c2cd428efab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2772054a4f80db8c8ea9795e955eafd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b884ef438558a2e0044be058d460784, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ca4c2469e7bd42fe5a5743e1275c773, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42eea0e8a2b1fb71e11f475035acf76d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a96ec0c4edd671c3925e26f9d313660, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c4ea5e23e5b192526ecd64e3451fe01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53e0ac86ec0105ae0796ca7eda98a026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b73e6041acd7a072adeebad6e2874bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e48dc485c3f1b39e30cbab07c3f4eeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a25ce5ec429db953aa1ff3fd5a4338b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bc28e1947b7f99c5add5ca86e1be39f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cab78e39edff2b09430ce392127b842, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71c00b60d55dffc2bb5fd0eecc039b89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72e0e0b56dde780edf13628f64598ea8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/735de62787164ec064b3fd82575908f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/784e63c9724399cc0227979a8e05bd51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/800c4d491743e31e489b405d165fe6fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d5c21435d3f9e32ac02a0be3d94e80a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9278ba0450a1d8ef77db6d38db4e2c00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/950964af481048cc44a1637d8868a023, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cd334dec544d0b27d9d4aa9dc4c115d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ce00f3deceb9d99f87a5e9216a6a61e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d40a318bb88940419929426ecb3961b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0f46a854949b1ea4929b6f1392014a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5b92442d77136c47267f61880d283be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a78a9b9319d2bd7823595f3ba27bf0b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7ff818c75b085836a2bc51e4110b266, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b32163bc03293fad5eae278bfd8c5085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7311d7c54c94b6f1547143f2baf7149, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b97b3fcd99e7bec48116c7d274f2ed5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c08ac1fb1d0ae2bc57358e5023a8c71b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c456dac42509a714e2c35a904223adea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caf21dbf1bcaee70ec70e5c63d208055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d85b62fa69a36bfb85ca1c872d931504, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de4f7848323d750524c8d70b7ccf835d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3fd188e106c1cccadad5c1d220c0403, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6ff3ae66e20fdd8ac008dfbc6a4e9aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e884709d2fcb056f8b9504c057cea588, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f139180e0d018c4678b88884d26421e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f47cc017ed6314ed30e6df69601da4cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f872c93a50715cb5295893eb91c7ef3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f88d9d2c256e4f4d20cf9af4d9c4df72"

Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive ‘One Health’ interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.

We hypothesized that either exogenous treatment with oxytocin or the presence of the calf at first milking would lead to higher colostrum quantity and higher IgG concentration. The study was conducted from October to December 2017 on a commercial dairy farm in Germany. A total of 567 cows at the time of calving were enrolled, but for the final analyses only 521 animals were considered. The cows were randomly assigned on a daily basis into 1 of 3 groups: (1) control group (n = 177), (2) application of 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. (OXY; n = 163), and (3) presence of the calf (CA; n = 181) before and during milking. Cows in the control and oxytocin group had no contact with their calves after calving and were milked in a separate milking parlor. Cows in the oxytocin group were injected with 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. 3 min before manual stimulation. For cows in the third group, the calf was placed into a calf cart and located in front of the cow 3 min before manipulation of the cow. Colostrum quantity was determined by a digital hanging scale. The colostrum quality was assessed with digital Brix refractometry and ELISA. To evaluate the effect of 2 different treatment procedures, a generalized linear mixed model was constructed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM, Ehningen, Germany). The mean (±SE) colostrum quantity was 4.17 ± 0.30 kg. The treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quantity. Parity, calf birth weight, and calving time affected colostrum quantity. Cows in second parity had the lowest quantity of colostrum (3.74 ± 0.37 kg) compared with cows in parity 1 (4.75 ± 0.34 kg) and cows in parity 3 or greater (4.75 ± 0.38 kg). Cows calving during the night (2200 until 0600 h; 4.93 ± 0.37 kg) had the highest quantity of colostrum compared with cows calving in the morning (0600 until 1400 h; 4.17 ± 0.38 kg) or afternoon (1400 until 2200 h; 4.14 ± 0.34 kg). Regarding colostrum quality, 48% of the colostrum samples contained ≥50 mg of IgG/mL. The mean IgG concentration was 54.6 ± 2.80 mg of IgG/mL. Colostrum quality was affected by the treatment procedures, colostrum quantity, parity, calving time, harvesting time after calving, and the calving day during the week. Both treatment procedures (i.e., OXY with mean IgG concentration results of 57.0 mg of IgG/mL and CA with 56.0 mg of IgG/mL) resulted in higher IgG concentrations in colostrum compared with the control group (50.7 mg of IgG/mL). With increasing colostrum quantity, the colostrum quality decreased in primiparous and multiparous cows. A longer time lag between calving and milking negatively affected the colostrum quality. Concentration of IgG was higher for cows in parity 3 or greater (64.6 ± 2.59 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows in parity 1 (48.5 ± 2.86 mg of IgG/mL) and cows in parity 2 (50.7 ± 2.89 mg of IgG/mL). Cows calving during the night had greater IgG concentrations (60.4 ± 2.92 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows calving in the morning (51.9 ± 2.98 mg of IgG/mL) or afternoon (51.3 ± 2.71 mg of IgG/mL). Harvesting colostrum on quieter days, such as Sundays, resulted in higher IgG concentrations (61.4 ± 3.70 mg of IgG/mL). The assessment by Brix refractometry resulted in a mean result of 26.0 ± 0.20% Brix. Treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quality. A negative association was observed between colostrum quantity and quality in primiparous and multiparous cows determined by Brix refractometry. Brix readings were greater for cows in parity 3 or higher (27.7 ± 0.26% Brix) compared with cows in parity 1 (25.3 ± 0.30% Brix) and cows in parity 2 (25.0 ± 0.32% Brix). In conclusion, the treatment procedure for the first milking is irrelevant to improve the quantity of colostrum. Both treatment procedures, however, increased IgG concentrations as determined by ELISA.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64f3b6915a1e87bf310604e733c23747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fa23c48d151592fb13d93f0adb481c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2ed1c17f2ad222b2b9bb51095c31a8d"

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV.Author SummaryInfectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08103bc23f2450644141574b08dc8a22,

These molecules were developed during evolution through natural selection in that they fit many important molecular targets, often receptors, of cells, which are seen in molecules that mimic endogenous neurotransmitters. The chapter discusses that microorganisms and herbivores rely on plants as a food source. Since both have survived, there must be mechanisms of adaptations toward the defensive chemistry of plants. Many herbivores have evolved strategies to avoid the extremely toxic plants and prefer the less toxic ones. Many herbivores have potent mechanisms to detoxify xenobiotics, which allow the exploitation of at least the less toxic plants. In insects, many specialists evolved that are adapted to the defense chemicals of their host plant, in that they accumulate these compounds and exploit them for their own defense. Alkaloids function as defense molecules against insect predators in the examples studied, and this is further support for the hypothesis that the same compound also serves for chemical defense in the host plant. It needs more experimental data to understand fully the intricate interconnections between plants, their alkaloids, and herbivores, microorganisms, and other plants.",""

METHODS: We were investigated the effects of Q7R on the cytopathic effects (CPE) by CPE reduction assay. Production of DNA fragment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PEDV infection were studied using DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the course of this study it was discovered that Q7R is an extremely potent compound against PEDV. The addition of Q7R to PEDV-infected Vero cells directly reduced the formation of a visible cytopathic effect (CPE). Also, Q7R did not induce DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, ROS increased the infection of PEDV, which was strongly decreased by N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC). However, the increased ROS was not decreased by Q7R. Antiviral activity of antioxidants such as NAC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and the vitamin E derivative, trolox, were hardly noticed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the inhibition of PEDV production by Q7R is not simply due to a general action as an antioxidants and is highly specific, as several other antioxidants (NAC, PDTC, trolox) are inactive against PEDV infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39fb1f609b4faede6c1ecb7ba5146de1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/659325b56a95ac5926503a09688ba7e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8168028fdb428de4c7fcc88474fc2104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9e4c430f515c12342a347832779e795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6662c5a93ea2f872fac11c23c76fc5e"

In contrast to Bayesian estimation approaches that always raise the question of how to set priors for the parameters, this frequentist approach relies on modeling the error structure in the data.

The design of a CC QTL mapping study involves multiple decisions, including which and how many strains to use, and how many replicates per strain to phenotype, all viewed within the context of hypothesized QTL architecture. Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses from extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4) the distribution of functionally distinct alleles among the founder strains at the QTL. We also provide general power estimates to aide in the design of future experiments. All analyses were conducted with our R package, SPARCC (Simulated Power Analysis in the Realized Collaborative Cross), developed for performing either large scale power analyses or those tailored to particular CC experiments.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0618e77aceabd77ee7e62d87bc95704c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28653de2c6401cc747cc36fd742de16a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40cf5ee5d5ce698ed6ea1a2b096d31c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d14afd3fd3ec3c72df7b29303b63e59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51b6a17af251f711f3a376285bc3d824, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54c883e9e1ff39d798d037b7a076c975, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6882920711fd2b56ecab1b03d15fa770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6997b5f746aee265d7796d96f1ccad97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71fc1dd553396186c7a1f01a71dae2a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96d283b70183f3c862c32ef7f8601d5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8700e849eac04b4475d9fd19fd90932, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb426f21b275423d610e572144eb4d44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf7c33d3efd159c781ffea86e69e6722, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebf7fee8347f231bf60ca73aa1d9184d"

However, our recent cellular studies reveal that removing the Ubl2 domain from MERS PLpro has no effect on its ability to process the viral polyprotein or act as an interferon antagonist, which involves deubiquitinating and deISGylating cellular proteins. Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro. The X-ray structure of MERS PLpro-∆Ubl2 was determined to 1.9 Å and compared to PLpro containing the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. While the structures were nearly identical, the PLpro-∆Ubl2 enzyme revealed the intact structure of the substrate-binding loop. Moreover, PLpro-∆Ubl2 catalysis against different substrates and a purported inhibitor revealed no differences in catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and inhibition. Further, no changes in thermal stability were observed between enzymes. We conclude that the catalytic core of MERS PLpro, i.e. without the Ubl2 domain, is sufficient for catalysis and stability in vitro with utility to evaluate potential inhibitors as a platform for structure-based drug design.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ed3898a3fcea2301e5e0cf92b00bbda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/307140528f8b32f602a7ae71cfe01293, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/416914a35adeffd0bb9b1587203863ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/444be3169ccfece3a6c705c4d8947e04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65b1f3fe797e6810a59be0112738616e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/663e8a65db171093540e7df019e40c7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78e2aaf3151fad971d89262cac89779d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/814313779015659980cdd74b5115cd8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d35ddd2f4c68ce5f1a444233340c736, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90df524a9e265dd068d986b1f29aa3c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99ea0ba96b35e6e01d44841171cfb47e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e9f56fafbbb775a5c097d858d1189b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aaab0b396f3142929158f375780dcd99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c325013627fbeda6dc4c20bd44bb2d21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e492f6bb86d09e8317f041e92602ab11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e69e813ae869ad6384111756d1e0e9c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e72fc64ca3fb4e303d0eab207d9ca195, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1a11b7a38eb986705c52adaa739ab25"

Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were, the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination partners. Furthermore, results of this study highlight an important role for the stem region of the RNA structure elements in promoting recombination.

Fecal BKV excretion was positive in 16/40 patients, of whom 10 were transient (<3 consecutively positive samples), six were persistent (⩾3 consecutively positive samples) and three were persistent with peaking (⩾10(3)-fold increase in viral load over baseline, reaching 5.11 × 10(6), 4.68 × 10(7) and 2.75 × 10(8) copies/sample at 14, 14 and 21 days post-HSCT, respectively). Urinary BKV excretion was positive in 25/40 patients. Fecal BKV excretion was significantly correlated with that of the urine (P=0.036) and was significantly associated with allogeneic HSCT (P=0.037) and persistent and peaking of urinary BKV excretion (P<0.001). Binary logistic regression showed that BKV viruria was the only significant risk factor for fecal BKV excretion (P=0.021).

The role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection has only recently been investigated. Expression of chemokines is induced by infection with laboratory-adapted, but not street, rabies viruses (RABVs), and it has been hypothesized that expression of chemokines is one of the mechanisms by which RABV is attenuated. To further define the role of chemokines in rabies pathogenesis and protection, chemokine genes such as MIP-1α, RANTES, IP-10, and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) have been cloned into RABV genome. It has been found that recombinant RABVs expressing RANTES or IP-10 induce high and persistent expression of these chemokines, resulting in massive infiltration of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS) and development of diseases and death in the mouse model. However, recombinant RABVs expressing MIP-1α, MDC, as well as GM-CSF further attenuate RABV by inducing a transient expression of chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhancement of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Yet, these recombinant RABVs show increased adaptive immune responses by recruiting/activating dendritic cells, T and B cells in the periphery as well as in the CNS. Further, direct administration of these recombinant RABVs into the CNS can prevent mice from developing rabies days after infection with street RABV. All these studies together suggest that chemokines are both protective and pathogenic in RABV infections. Those with protective roles could be exploited for development of future RABV vaccines or therapeutic agents.",""

We recently determined the crystal structures of NL63 coronavirus (NL63-CoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptor-binding domains (RBDs), each complexed with their common receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and proposed the existence of a virus-binding hot spot on hACE2. Here we investigated the function of this hypothetical hot spot using structure-guided biochemical and functional assays. The hot spot consists of a salt bridge surrounded by hydrophobic tunnel walls. Mutations that disturb the hot spot structure have significant effects on virus/receptor interactions, revealing critical energy contributions from the hot spot structure. The tunnel structure at the NL63-CoV/hACE2 interface is more compact than that at the SARS-CoV/hACE2 interface, and hence RBD/hACE2 binding affinities are decreased either by NL63-CoV mutations decreasing the tunnel space or by SARS-CoV mutations increasing the tunnel space. Furthermore, NL63-CoV RBD inhibits hACE2-dependent transduction by SARS-CoV spike protein, a successful application of the hot spot theory that has the potential to become a new antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV infections. These results suggest that the structural features of the hot spot on hACE2 were among the driving forces for the convergent evolution of NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV.",""

To maintain hospital function under critical situations such as a pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that increase and decrease the willingness to work. Previous hospital-based studies have examined this question using hypothetical events, but so far it has not been examined in an actual pandemic. Here, we surveyed the factors that influenced the motivation and hesitation of hospital workers to work in Japan soon after the pandemic (H1N1) 2009. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous questionnaires about demographic character and stress factors were distributed to all 3635 employees at three core hospitals in Kobe city, Japan and were collected from June to July, 2009, about one month after the pandemic (H1N1) in Japan. RESULTS: Of a total of 3635 questionnaires distributed, 1693 (46.7%) valid questionnaires were received. 28.4% (N = 481) of workers had strong motivation and 14.7% (N = 249) had strong hesitation to work. Demographic characters and stress-related questions were categorised into four types according to the odds ratios (OR) of motivation and hesitation to work: some factors increased motivation and lowered hesitation; others increased motivation only; others increased hesitation only and others increased both motivation and hesitation. The strong feeling of being supported by the national and local governments (Multivariate OR: motivation; 3.5; CI 2.2-5.4, hesitation; 0.2; CI 0.1-0.6) and being protected by hospital (Multivariate OR: motivation; 2.8; CI 2.2-3.7, hesitation; 0.5; CI 0.3-0.7) were related to higher motivation and lower hesitation. Here, protection included taking precautions to prevent illness among workers and their families, providing for the care of those who do become ill, reducing malpractice threats, and financial support for families of workers who die on duty. But 94.1% of the respondents answered protection by the national and local government was weak and 79.7% answered protection by the hospital was weak. CONCLUSIONS: Some factors have conflicting effects because they increase both motivation and hesitation. Giving workers the feeling that they are being protected by the national and local government and hospital is especially valuable because it increases their motivation and lowers their hesitation to work.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ebbefbe3cf9c82d59fe97dab2650de9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/121c7be739788be0937a17c32fa1dd65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f57a042946ab127b33909f119b21760, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36cbc3d1b6612a932429ebd351d73f7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cb3abbefd73663909ee23f375cd8130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4091a2ed223653a2f5f806169bb057b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50a0f0c0949a33c0b5abefd26b5243e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5502ca53968ea13c8eba34379297c463, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62fc607e881492ccbd91129474be388a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64c199a2cc28c9a20c9a459258e4e4b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f45ec951d9b8221b09930c58aac37f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a3c5e93c336e7e0b3fbac731ecbe649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/974595706cd22b26da2949e02de07cda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b88f124cd83eb70ea51dea641b33e41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a67e52c7952ad93c8270d8e136925127, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa97b6de919de68102f43b92b0e94808, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae300d88d81a5484c6d363d461e155fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc10be520c4013a46e13f68c5f4d7977, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d68c9f6609a61c743cd5b950811d469c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dee1a9366a45c2cb37fb207bab6285f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef762e715a04dd732e592a769027c9d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f856c53821f502a2b17e7fde57fc6c66"

Virus isolation attempts were carried out on a large panel of different cell types including primary pig kidney cells and lung macrophages, primary rabbit kidney cells and seven established cell lines (MARC-145, ST117, PK15, BHK21, HeLa, Vero, and MDCK). Although these represent cells with susceptibility to a wide range of known viruses, the results did not provide evidence for a specific virus other than PCV2 contributing to the development of PMWS. Furthermore, in order to test whether specific genotypes of PCV2 may trigger the switch from PCV2 infection to clinical disease, we compared complete DNA genome sequences of PCV2 derived from PMWS-positive as well as PMWS-negative pigs. On the basis of the DNA sequences, the PCV2 isolates were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisting of one isolate originating from a herd unaffected by PMWS, with group 2 consisting of nine isolates originating from four PMWS-affected herds, four PMWS-positive pigs plus one unaffected herd. The PCV2 genomes from the two groups showed 95.5% identity. Alignment analyses of the sequences encoding the replicase and capsid protein from group 1 and group 2 PCV2 isolates showed two amino acid differences encoded in the replicase protein, while 19 amino acid differences were predicted among the capsid protein sequences. The PCV2 DNA sequence analysis supports recent observations from studies in USA as well as Europe, which suggest that strain variations may influence the clinical outcome of PCV2 infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e5f23c60c21607a11f1a1d6baedc969, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2332164c2d0d2e8117026d8fb53d82c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25819e1b93e6203ddbdb0221e8500ceb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27c60f29bf8bca9f49681558c5656381, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e378744063006fd162c776dae746b74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33c985cbe7e8db425a7bff28ce7817dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36be6c8e2894300abbc5a2719a3422b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/377dcca3616a81e1975332f10b7a6d70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38df59e83eff887ee73590709f38ef0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/410269287408fa11c5f059c1593c46f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43063666019a9e58a9698e30c211409a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d85329356dd214a89dc560ae890cf20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/500c8de2cf58f17057b0bc601b6af27f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/576f1ac63e37df4e239d29ad471d885f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78273d098be610a09d72508be66887d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79ddc4a3bbda7390061e8eec310ae134, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/807822ef2b1cee490f8f402edea69a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84beb4557b119a80bc860a454ef7cd06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a748c1b8b4a3e6e888ab10019d59943, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95d4a8065c21106695d548d9d4da1f7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac0ec4fb99a4f57250895dd88a5783d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae91792114f5299e1bd0f8ee3f118eec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0ef4f615b226f5886f69266ed21ee4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc12ab3f12b4556bd3c58b025a1a59ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c41a9fa08099a7ff9763f1eefe27e738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d86f7d3cefbb95c680c5205fb20f7c44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1d0775bf06a43118b45082d353102ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e97e77e1f37277999a0ffa54e589ad9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eacb7fa7bb98ed24f0d0fe3e23c9ac4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee37ad5244994f7a01a85d52059964a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f09eca60149a85c0a44126c069bf526c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7ef36b1443cbb36c5f439d6ae7f9b96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbd576af3886da6948fa20b20e686db8"

The Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort (WISC) study was established in central Wisconsin to test the hypothesis that early life animal farm exposures are associated with distinct innate immune cell maturation trajectories, decreased allergen sensitization and reduced respiratory viral illness burden during the first 2 years of life. Beginning in 2013, a total of 240 families have been enrolled, 16,522 biospecimens have been collected, and 4098 questionnaires have been administered and entered into a secure database. Study endpoints include nasal respiratory virus identification and respiratory illness burden score, allergic sensitization, expression of allergic disease, and anti-viral immune response maturation and profiles. The WISC study prospective design, broad biospecimen collections, and unique US rural community will provide insights into the role of environmental exposures on early life immune maturation profiles associated with protection from allergic sensitization and significant respiratory viral disease burden. The WISC study findings will ultimately inform development of new strategies to promote resistance to severe respiratory viral illnesses and design primary prevention approaches for allergic diseases for all infants.

Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-β reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-β responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bb556c0d53150b73194dc485319ea1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11c8fc1619a4034508c0d0f0f9fdb942, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1231748f5699846eda48fb1609d9fadd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13323e810f996537f071d9b5124ed1f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18f2a8528be8c1f7436ed57f9858a354, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/236b73a2f6136084102d43eef6371a20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e8dbca3df57238e62868ad1935a7e4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34ab097d33d21112c2d356af6536c97e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4333140c38fc44194728d5f8f9fe1e23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a1c31d06818964af5f617dc9ba651d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d1d1ade97c0635cc6222bc3ab2b7ce1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53ec9b4f670d3eff0e15a0c795b2fc28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/607dde8f895d7406ba651b34b58d4d71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60b4347719f3afa280b6df92f0c36b05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/678347c97ec6071d2da1be4717ed378c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ea96383c9fe408c97c2293378652852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75210faebc8b58c9f40a93de84865476, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f79697ecee0ebf317b7e4a83b06b00c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87d1a454ff776c0330fe7fdf98fab95b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ca5c3c2ddc89d9fadd56d55f6870fae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cf1d7500e1a3946da50ece31543dddc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d37864cf0ef1a5a25253dc651ea3170, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99ed0f011b728475e47e9a9db6c6a061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a1ef65329b014a1522403f5fac1d2bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b5e08d8f9cf9996e3c659b40b09efe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d4dac9c50a63f83484f057b51650e9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd83277e31347e33acc5b174fc0b1a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a205614d7d351b9bde178f36e9fae75d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a20567bc64e3107b595883795c370a4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a509a25cf109338a25df2ed6aca144d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6c3700e3140b80ebfaa9e218d9e1c33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8ae721aa6ddab8d9db389964099b613, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbb23ac0b6721c059cc59eb8dbcd05f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be8564050b449d5616860d36757d57e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf2a4719015dc66bdd04594afeaa11c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfa3b7d8122881ddba82ce53a1629158, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2425db5a9c61f017e2294717ab7021d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29a6b9779012074e8eba4c3370ad49e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd3986e01582ef570f690c763827fc43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d06a308843abfc926425ffa8b7fb0ad6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8d05af66c8ad93e2930f65ccc10e97d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbeee232c196b52924889df9a62d3733, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e44bfb0535108212b0f4b3f5f439af24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7374da6bf8af5d1b73f1e20c2bb802b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec97ee42b77dd754873649d12ad84b72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f55bae67427dda467bf156a8cafe5bcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f715d9d039081e4fdc63b00061d6ac0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f78a717b44a72138bf4e25ffcad627ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb486c3acc1fb5cb9c4f7d82c1327c21"

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f724e83386a96bb0b098a7dae37e077, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15a6a04cbf41ce6c1ed6323ce27f872d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/421d34ed6b62df4001ace75872b8a0d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fe9850f276a8534788107e192960d95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72df29b57378da97ebb481cc2afb6849, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e058228bf56a555e6d12caeef6ee14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bdc8247308f3caf3e6923e552c491c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b558c3698f2bb3ca131413efbfc04011, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b64ef0c5852711dfabd54b87c66041fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1bd84e1879bef0223e855f8e01cd88b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf5adb694b78ee224fa19256154b863c"

These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1–4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1–4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/008899808f9bb13f62600c2d9ddb3249, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0140fc442d54ad9b7e48007400fa7ad4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10c0f805e3812de44aa49c08f175c6d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/148ae3ccbd81b2efef93e951557741e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2510b5fc42240e3919a2e66678d61042, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2723b19ad9434081601ced80b550f44e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2742a4a1180a5b582b58a5be627ba602, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/288d947c3621e7386a69cb2a42f4414e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ceffdddc9358537a5fd24ced72964c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39c6844a2fa75c3a86f567e50f55a616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3edecaf43853ec57f8f065e968a35596, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d6fc4471956f15831774ae30fd42f17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fe7eb6c82ae1e40b4265ba7ce519676, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61c0a8bedbe0ce115350399ec0b9f500, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d7e463ec70dc1dceb0219c06f705181, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6daad01a47f6ba0ba8e533b85a21083d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76d047915b93f6a30245f694fb707f26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84367c8f3b8cf075b0d964d5ee5b1339, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/848e8344881d068dc9972eab7dbd95d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87ea2bb7aa6c35cc9c2736bbb68871da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/891df8b252dbbd22f2821f2b97a7924b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c365d8da03ad2821043244f9fb11e12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/930486ef26934e4dec4d8fdc19126058, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/942866b2ab961804a7e5264aab39ea61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/981426d7002da4ff62b9c1f5851ed3ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ede679636b2ec3b727105c5e4cda861, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a458ae74642771dbc32acc898e45ec05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab05b43c89d2a62a437571cce74965b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1cca197fa36088ca0552ffc028a6b4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc5e471f00a09e73b39c2bc4e9bfde74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf46b68e2d24e73cf2447c8618ea072d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c85e385b163a79ddf2809312281e3ffc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cba82070ad8da442b34cba3a1f6e9cad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5d2f21ebee8265e45fe8f186f902eba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df064ed2dd276cc28b51642f76327125, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b318a4ef0e8a12f1da6bddb55d011d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9907c5c8293c996e886269dda3918c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7277fdfb3576d37c48e0fe8d483ea2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf4ee3696556c7722f4ee82a0202155"

Phylogenetic analysis showed that TSHSV clusters with an arterivirus from a Chinese broad-headed pond turtle.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cf5ee62ac9bc21ff74b4e47d4254320, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/473bf7256b7e90ea34d684ae59bc6942, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51fd6a7d61dee2cf3e550ab34fb72676, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/539b6b63ca091d6b61ccb0522ab61629, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73dc11d0d31396934927640ff57266b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7451c4974e886d28d585ea5ad244890e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cadca256c0b2bb4ca322f07c718716a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82093959bb47fc9bfae311e23c840127, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/861df855399ddd7139b57993dc105629, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c55a5402b66749748a0e87edf721174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9209b87c0ab48e29d86c4cd9894aa0a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9726a833f2f159fbcaa8b11129d99c94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99a3229c08fb0d16536b0f1b2a25264a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99a4de71c6585309a6a1ede7d4ec6838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a83b087bfab6c4e66b9e282e132e5991, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab1b85f76d6033684634f35c6fbadefb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b592f22a59a188f9cf2ba3737c8f0f89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfcc2c5044b44c618095dc556549554d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb1269f495c20c6205aaf897e1ce4008, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cea1962e791e157fd9caba22426a6a16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe386d57fdd708943142cf548fecf900"

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4’s impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.ImportanceGiven the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, this work suggest that Muc4 expression plays a protective role in female mice not conserved in male mice following SARS-CoV infection. With the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continuing, treatments that modulate or enhance Muc4 activity may provide an avenue for treatment and improved outcomes. In addition, the work highlights the importance of studying host factors including host genetics and biological sex as key parameters influencing infection and disease outcomes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27bad01c151fd2faa53859a47afa46e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38eb1968d001aeeee11c89581f6d8f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/582c762d92cac4b756c376d3f26fb863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dfa12f37b7921530ef2cb916c7b513b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60265a4fb2c791ab517422a8d5ded4d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60eb20cfdf59b064b4975cf11a411db8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/992163ef3b4d69010809a7b8dae83251, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab4b089831398a66548632ef126cf411, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bef7c58f447e2a12e879349b6538fe00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4eadf5e92d8b048d2d811154e032373, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea1c5fe80fc66565e4a7a40168dcba6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0ee68ad013d2cdd8b136fc1574e4672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4a3886d9ad22c622071f3c45b35398c"

However, its clinical use has been limited by severe toxicity, associated primarily with systemic administration with excess protein distributing freely throughout the body. We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate forms permitting more restricted localization may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity. Here, we have tested the utility of palmitate-derivatized rhIL-2. rhIL-2 was reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide palmitate ester. The resultant lipidated rhIL-2 (pIL-2), when mixed with cells, could spontaneously transfer from solution to cell surfaces. Next, anticancer efficacy of pIL-2 was assessed in two modalities. For adoptive T cell therapy, antitumor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were protein transferred (“painted”) with pIL-2 and injected into mice bearing lymphoma. For in situ therapy, pIL-2 was injected intratumorally into mice bearing melanoma. Tumor growth and IL-2-associated toxicity were determined. RESULTS: In the lymphoma model, painting of the antitumor CTLs with pIL-2 markedly increased their viability and titer. In the melanoma model, intratumoral injection of pIL-2, but not rhIL-2, increased the number of activated CD8(+) T cells (IFN-γ(+)) in the spleen, reduced lung metastasis and prolonged the survival of treated mice. Moreover, while repeated intratumoral injection of rhIL-2 at an excessively high dose (10 injections of 10000 IU/mouse) caused marked vascular leakage syndrome, the same regimen using pIL-2 caused no detectable toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Transferring spontaneously from solution to cell surfaces, pIL-2 may bypass the current limitations of rhIL-2 and, thus, serve as a more effective and tolerable anticancer drug.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a63272f898420fa323bc2d4754a748c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10a37015023324eaac3984b8b19cfb46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11077cfc9a3812f4a6f22090fa89feaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a177e11f0bc23a8b5472e9f9507f964, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f998fc1e1e1d39083c70a10410b5468, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3141cb1e788b99659df3aa58559a926c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32562169072461a926d4781a92312f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3678d2f9d0aeda8bccf1aeca6bba4a5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d84b5d7380571cc43e3048050b971b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42f4faa1283f605a61a3ea59b2751932, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/468602d46053e97562b5e54e1306b4c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f0eb4a3718618611aabf436127dda86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61ce07635e76d4414243f27b5ecbb2a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ca782b71cf307bac69b45f69891d44c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71e258edbe5a5af9672e883f4761377a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ff23ee7e2a14eac8509fab55151c3bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f16aa10aedf9dcf50c2158d49b7a36e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90ed5928d09b61392f6a24d40cfd4134, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91bede11d80d8ee9cb4c6c3c721f01ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91d7b91182c6527ce80a325cdf91a5c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95780844106e02e929cfd7c5475617e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ae7fec673801c724f2e262e4a4ffea0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d6bcaa0a41d90851289876d7b6a62dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aff8f6bb52753727cdf01bae4ef28374, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0c1b86357bcf5339194389f11f6269a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba499d4f977801956bc59f8f41d44415, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0a71412f46b956955bcdda1c6406947, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d81991caf48d92113a0782eb8e7f6570, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3867838c196d3c7d93bdd010f020c6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fef11f1299d731ec2a748bd79de2af30"

On the other hand, the partial response of patients with MS to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy support the evidence of an autoimmune etiology for MS. However, the autoimmune hypothesis shares the same criticism with the infectious one in that no autoantigen(s) specific to and causative for MS has ever been identified. Nevertheless, the absence of identifiable infectious agent, especially viral does not rule out its presence at a certain time – point and the concomitant long term triggering of an autoimmune cascade of events thereafter.

Theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors. Hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections, and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores. In light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas, our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes. We used ELISA and Western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena Ig epitopes. Molecular weights of heavy (IgA, IgG, IgM) and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis, and as expected, they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins. In order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response, eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) and serum anti-DNP responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for one year. The full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to thoroughly investigate the hyena antibody response, and can be used in future studies to test hypotheses about pathogen exposure and immune function in this species.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c3f5eff2b703df01fee7ef4d894ebb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/120a4362b1fb8cecc9e10b877b119504, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17a48fe794219c1512e47067c794fe74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c15aae9e442b2255fa14bf16844fc48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ca798807043e52c800c8694dda5da78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21372a8f1621ba130e2ef7b6144c11a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dbf804f06831d1d1c8bcef9a66c7c32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30b31a77eead55d157ac22ef17493aeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3db8e75ca39cf7b15c1122b41680d14e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e4a31839877ac4b77b9decd2d8a12dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/414416683c7d982c8e6083dfbe43031f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4326689661f2c9ec316802de08e68a13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48f8e4ecd6a958f2efc2d0a008d32a56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/577e66012763af70767a8f978839210e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b329a1e040639f0ac77156785a2b289, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bc813a91c9e8d966d69294a439b2d60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63a73855a421513cffd52356c1749617, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/660e80641888d66f980c1ecde1158469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690df4a03197adef28c03f710d3a14bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b4c172a280207a4bcb6f8170120c9b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b7808ab62823bab1a14a99eba7fb211, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c9c6d840b19d4d954963ed89f178eb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f56158d47cc31c9bd1aae8a3023f6fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76afdec7acef4484888807e567862bbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e52581c0e0d147439a6f206b0d8825c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f27bcd3343d5062e2da7d47aca531de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83d01e1804834d7b825e426878f1e1ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88e6f4682dff49bc9a1fe08df95a8251, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b3d2b3bd80c834b8748627fab57e13f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d3a8add3529a01ed4d3b018088112e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/941c873f122a5c2f2ea0bbc075877e26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/945d39b4005ebb87012cb247c54e620d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95bdd7848c6690715638983cf394dfc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96559c5465afa539c24611972e403879, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97f3f11d1472895f439ced735bd16b3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c79f3731d2a435f787b53e579de5a00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4039ab2c93f91f5741ff0ba6a202792, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab699d0c31dbc7dae855e0aabc8cc24a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3d19b5aee2fd7f99a840ec0581c6389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b97544482717cacaf10dc9c0c4a8eaeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc9fde2c01de82a4b32e2cdec0046116, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bff8af6e1103ea7f07b03bf4ac92ad47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1659f4bae51f8cd5ebd4189f11b1072, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c826d13e07bfe86a06abfbc13de989b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdae1f8f41d975e2e3c7268607c2e1f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d08b14b39a6057cd3e3f92242faadbf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1e78b757ec21f4550b3b376a4b28fba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4ed5ef59d106bf46f47dcb068d02099, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d525b35e48051d3fa7a2c7e41255f883, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc263bebacb7046a2223a0828b5eb51e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc62256a0c507d3ff8b7502f92a112d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd037c9d60ac7f21b50142285d1fd23f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd1fc5d9e94b46f35526c23c612caedc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e67cee3ceba459489d0ac61a37a5913d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6e5e72c580bffa1b40e2479f031ff3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f894fe8c257b4fbd539b07da4ea5d471, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9a9f0551db8bf0c8117bd8fef19c214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb2068ec891abe643c2c8e52b4916bbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb272fcc313fe865c89fd07101973431, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbf1376ed2eb7c6d6998e1e94b585dea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd1cea99fa5a25002eb4a9e217b2f88f"

Here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps. A large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance DENV infection. Investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to study interactions between DENV and antibodies. These studies indicate that antibody neutralization of DENVs is a “multi-hit” phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion. The most potently neutralizing mouse MAbs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain III of the dengue envelope (E) protein. One challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse MAbs to better understand the human antibody response. The human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different DENV serotypes. Here we review studies conducted with immune sera and MAbs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections. Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion. The leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of FcγR bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis. By understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance DENV, it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0de6e2a586cd941d3ba9a1979aa93d4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aa71a5ab07e667c0a0f529d2e1a62ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/239ea1d4bb51fdb4ff08b250f8b56ef7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2651fc041f463ed860984a8f6747e93a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2754ce08ab69ad00a6ef7eb9eb764e47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33c2c233cca158736a32a612cc21b44f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36b9ce21bee0b9f7f7dbcf34cc8fccf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d7745d3af25462a992a2f799e3ec4ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3da23600652f5a1822bd76c6b524423a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e16469fea0d3558cacacc27fff6ff33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ee0a3432c5da82814d675d2dadaa050, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4019fc8df8d2bf27a17316317163c397, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e972f17dd8d00e9b51ac38ccb3e4000, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b8992b8b91e25e2d697edd59b98ad65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f8f430ce6f47ac86e1468cbb3a29f27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a679407caa353e774a9a5a1b7d03fa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7eada8924ed03ee48a81078ac07be16b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99c9d3ea3faa0378ed3d7091694618a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afd79a6dba0a18244aae74fe9c970792, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6207e695fc87c26b448d8d788c4ec22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be93c9cebfc7a912d01a6c223d027e7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c56538fa07232e87a562a143cb76c4af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1ab0ec4ef9f14fd3a33c79a897f03d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d599b3a022adf5ac417a8588d7b953d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db2f057211e0d257875f7c09a62fc8d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de65ca63f295eebaa6709ce265738c8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e389783e7a7a6a95e36fb5ead005711f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efd5b211abae7824fb8ba9fead15e669, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5bd4c035751b0bc1795ecaceba35351, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f85a532df785e344afac95bb3922e837"

We hypothesized that oral VA supplementation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected pregnant gilts would enhance the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA axis to boost lactogenic immunity and passive protection of nursing piglets against PEDV challenge. Gilts received daily oral retinyl acetate (30 000 IU) starting at gestation day 76 throughout lactation. At 3–4 weeks pre-partum, VA-supplemented (PEDV + VA) and non-supplemented (PEDV) gilts were PEDV or mock inoculated (mock + VA and mock, respectively). PEDV + VA gilts had decreased mean PEDV RNA shedding titers and diarrhea scores. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3–5 days post-partum. The survival rate of PEDV + VA litters was 74.2% compared with 55.9% in PEDV litters. Mock and mock + VA litter survival rates were 5.7% and 8.3%, respectively. PEDV + VA gilts had increased PEDV IgA antibody secreting cells and PEDV IgA antibodies in serum pre-partum and IgA(+)β7(+) (gut homing) cells in milk post piglet challenge compared with PEDV gilts. Our findings suggest that oral VA supplementation may act as an adjuvant during pregnancy, enhancing maternal IgA and lactogenic immune protection in nursing piglets.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/093a08a7124e22a250066b76e5fc2795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c0b3acec83d176bf4bda2de0ebdd1d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12e34b606b462ea9f9dbf0e6f60ea6de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/158621757c82fda499f3f9aa6bcfcb4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/175695e31bdb00dbbc5046a8a9bf107e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1843c4efbeddb2a4133c15ad20d29230, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2009e6b92adc9d6f239b9f26176b9f24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/295e8cdaab1311cc017d193c999054fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29ad81553aa07e8c4bff109428438638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dd66cfc8aab452ce84b008cf15c0f2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f9f120372d82f922243951d3956ca36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31570e366908d75d22a557ea9528953e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34dffee1a851a2852dbd5cb69d468a24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f0051ea5814e5e9eaa0814f87f54f94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4123051daf9eb0b67695abe4341b4165, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/415c95fa8ff216798a8ae9c543ff3e1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44a90726d42257f53e68874a3872bb02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58d5001d5579b72bb6862521c1f6bd5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58d7beed7bc9cff19209c6dda1c89f3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fa1609513aacd56cd20370fde6fc3c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62560f90047e696a94460c687034d58d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/674ee69cb18fabb6e4992eb03389c637, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/686e9b96eeb1e47aef787ccb924e5473, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69255893ef18d95461ae70d0fc6b2a75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72581eb374cfeafb238985d730ee17d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bb966cecd86f4f785555c5dc6588bac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c14e3b347e0e5612b8155476c0a4132, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ce8f620b5750d0402b2bc8946a76a8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/806004262baf30c4fed7a2d6cf5a7ede, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/820c22b43cf6ff28ebe74f4567fffc9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84ea7507de544c62468ecf7c47349bbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85ce219dc1c60f47de507e5f9b17dc22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86ad40f8b615e922646b6583e93903ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/969a4fd177600efcafa277419fcfd4d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b805d7fe3ffbf61daa20ffcbeade18b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bd4d177a09ecf4b1133765661e9a126, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c2ff78bc7af79e5b5598a743b9ecb46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a858283bf4e2770cdf94e249d04a2214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa9226a7d1578182278c8ba62fb2cd8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac5edaa6d24dd329b4aa269081b5bfd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b718f5c4f907f79e2f0ccd64038c4abb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b790df237a06eb4caefe471ccf27efc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b999e1a726c7ce2b0e2efcf45cb73ed1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba7daa614f7025a85453cb473eb47b22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdb021af97a693161eeab636e8a8b25d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccbd427c403c470c2dbef30f542185c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccff2a7ca24ca375693bef974cbfdb43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dddf1badbd23e6b6b3d9caa08d61919b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f11ed962f19b24aaed924f142ea02b2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe426ed8e9d7d367512dd70d73faae79"

This may involve overproliferation of alveolar type II cells. In an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, we have shown that the administration of an adenoviral vector overexpressing the 70-kd heat shock protein (AdHSP) limited pathophysiological changes. We hypothesized that this improvement may be modulated, in part, by an early AdHSP-induced attenuation of alveolar type II cell proliferation. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. SETTING: Hadassah-Hebrew University and University of Pennsylvania animal laboratories. SUBJECTS: Sprague-Dawley Rats (250 g). INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via cecal ligation and double puncture. At the time of cecal ligation and double puncture, we injected phosphate-buffered saline, AdHSP, or AdGFP (an adenoviral vector expressing the marker green fluorescent protein) into the trachea. Rats then received subcutaneous bromodeoxyuridine. In separate experiments, A549 cells were incubated with medium, AdHSP, or AdGFP. Some cells were also stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α. After 48 hrs, cytosolic and nuclear proteins from rat lungs or cell cultures were isolated. These were subjected to immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, fluorescent immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alveolar type I cells were lost within 48 hrs of inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This was accompanied by alveolar type II cell proliferation. Treatment with AdHSP preserved alveolar type I cells and limited alveolar type II cell proliferation. Heat shock protein 70 prevented overexuberant cell division, in part, by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of the regulatory retinoblastoma protein. This prevented retinoblastoma protein ubiquitination and degradation and, thus, stabilized the interaction of retinoblastoma protein with E2F1, a key cell division transcription factor. CONCLUSIONS: Heat shock protein 70-induced attenuation of cell proliferation may be a useful strategy for limiting lung injury when treating acute respiratory distress syndrome if consistent in later time points.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12c52d5045fdac06db9bb062d5814a0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2637cd1f243b80944029290201d1a932, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/299b44a2f2a20de2b915a84ecdb45234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fe4aabe98fbbbb705a8a2572125fb86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65802dca1b67d27f351065b76aa61c53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ab3505e8e063efc30f187cdddb4e323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fac632435ee95ad9c74c68a8acbfe27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ccf91f6d25ac1af1bc86466ddf9c1ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84ba0eefbd9afaf2e5da9450dccb4e65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/860f95f9c8c43970165eac8ca101cf56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90cfb36648cd727f67748efc1b6160ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b471178ed42f4f1319d003636305a793"

While over-expression of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme type 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be beneficial in reducing hypertension by transforming Angiotensin (Ang)-II into Ang-(1-7), several groups have reported decreased brain ACE2 expression and activity during the development of hypertension. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding results in decreased membrane-bound ACE2 in the brain, thus promoting the development of neurogenic hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test this hypothesis, we used the DOCA-salt model of neurogenic hypertension in non-transgenic (NT) and syn-hACE2 mice over-expressing ACE2 in neurons. DOCA-salt treatment in NT mice led to significant increases in blood pressure, hypothalamic Ang-II levels, inflammation, impaired baroreflex sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, as well as decreased hypothalamic ACE2 activity and expression, while these changes were blunted or prevented in syn-hACE2 mice. In addition, reduction of ACE2 expression and activity in the brain paralleled a rise in ACE2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of NT mice following DOCA-salt treatment and was accompanied by enhanced ADAM17 expression and activity in the hypothalamus. Chronic knockdown of ADAM17 in the brain blunted the development of hypertension and restored ACE2 activity and baroreflex function. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first evidence that ADAM17-mediated shedding impairs brain ACE2 compensatory activity, thus contributing to the development of neurogenic hypertension.",""

Some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of MERS-CoV spike (S) is a good candidate antigen for a MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. However, highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic. We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen. Therefore, the immunogenicity of a novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes. Different vaccination regimens were compared in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly (i.m.) with a vaccine containing 10 µg of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD in combination with either aluminium hydroxide (alum) alone, alum and polyriboinosinic acid (poly I:C) or alum and cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). The immune responses of mice vaccinated with RBD, incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and CpG ODN by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route were also investigated. We evaluated the induction of RBD-specific humoral immunity (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity (ELISpot assay for IFN-γ spot-forming cells and splenocyte cytokine production). Our findings indicated that the combination of alum and CpG ODN optimized the development of RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination. Interestingly, robust RBD-specific antibody and T-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rRBD protein in combination with IFA and CpG ODN, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited. Our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes. The vaccination regimen used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine by eliciting effective humoral and cellular immune responses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03ca41be1bb5325ebbdc67c8af3f5e48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05d25d017481bba92e406928f32e2dd0,

Based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis, it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system. However, few studies have examined the differences between wild animals in their natural environments, in which they are typically exposed to a wide array of potential pathogens, and their conspecifics living in captivity. Wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are regularly exposed to myriad pathogens, but there is little evidence of disease-induced mortality in wild hyena populations, suggesting that immune defenses are robust in this species. Here we assessed differences in immune defenses between wild spotted hyenas that inhabit their natural savanna environment and captive hyenas that inhabit a captive environment where pathogen control programs are implemented. Importantly, the captive population of spotted hyenas was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations. Our results show that wild hyenas have significantly higher serum antibody concentrations, including total IgG and IgM, natural antibodies, and autoantibodies than do captive hyenas; there was no difference in the bacterial killing capacity of sera collected from captive and wild hyenas. The striking differences in serum antibody concentrations observed here suggest that complementing traditional immunology studies, with comparative studies of wild animals in their natural environment may help to uncover links between environment and immune function, and facilitate progress towards answering immunological questions associated with the hygiene hypothesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/016579d4cb5175afcdb93d1fd84e0ac6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05f83a954b79143427c84ff69b2a703a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16c03107c6452bdb27ccd310f006508e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19140a375d9b8c9ef57b1f7b9e66ece7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/213720530cd436a666733067d2a312ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/222cd45515546fd1b5d99a1ee20e8b03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ab9e925d563db2947608d1264e7e92b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c47b8d3ce02a03b66ebf52fdbfb3bbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50692a3263487274be1a6d8dbad8909e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6aae879bde79e301e615dcf939afb488, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/722213b542128d05bf72ace2a2214e43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7447196fd32524481090c48be2293fb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/848f9280f4fe7ef1ab05cf3e34a7c836, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/905655aeaa8c2c11dbcfe08c9a00db14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/916bcfe94cd61532800f44db846c4a81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/926db0c5e8c609ddbffece00b108015f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e8e8428f47b1d8d11feb449e268599e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1a6da5dfb6dcac8e1422f0d8eb3eb2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3b4eb2e5e8ddd2ad0c4264534cf56ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a437816224c309dde9b59a83c70230e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a79920f8f155ad2ae11f76c72320c046, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c9e4784711e586a012763b8f20ab94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd0272548c03dc36e0bcc6eb8d65bbc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1adf6f445b4704fe5f5d4fd303ac62c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d22407e143c19da1bf8ecf37605dbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c41f1cd8a3308481a9a2ffaa0b0067f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf8ad9071fda202faf10b7d1089c03db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbf5a5e9ba5d6299c053d0b85ade89d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df20c27989af70cd927fbafb17b433c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df647288d79d675906b764407b7e6aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e14a16d0951ec00d281e69abf3a2e76e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec1be7b0a4bb07c26f143fc786a6d741, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f71c35b797750555231c8d76459f2b43"

While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f48356202e340999f77e3b9ad441922, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/119475629652f2e3c9c995e04ffe5645, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13e7055251828c2734287f91ffd3241d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2932839ca02d8248615015c0fdb3ab6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f27a6c4dabeaca8afdaa1984655b37f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/323d357b23bd62e0e56d1ebcda72169d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34473fc51db245c07a9b31c12ad64744, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3720ccff360523f7ba0f9ae3d50cc0f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41dda6de8b077c478eff36de5fc54152, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6026f01f786b4210b4d62a34541a8e84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f3ccc5e437f0b0efaf5aa4321d345f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8542726c1a9977cdba4a8168fa3e8f5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eec7df057ae4d4ed2344237b9dbe019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/925bc90f6e783a978398b1dad386f091, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a6b2eeb21424723cf8e819324bece18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e9d179671abdd827a909d84edbc35a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4afa33e22920676b913cbf6993a6032, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0258751682c742ff3dc743e066ee5a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9ae2ebd74877ff62366b51cdabfed6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdcfbeadc0376e38af1fa4432ef400b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce7b9b32ae45e6174e186de7e6dc8a31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e42e496cf17640d833f1d71ba4241e98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb6a21adfe0390d47df4bb4dc6b88a53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb501aa40b3c758874cbb0c1c0b920f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0ae3f89f8b44f278762eec53a0ac63f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0d7c32f602d92a596de8b6f6ab8a732, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faa89788924308884f2b96d599134eea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe3026fbae6a5917905614af054d3cd3"

No, or not yet, is the qualified answer based on the evidence available. Although more than 200 viruses - some of them deadly zoonotic viruses - have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats, the supposed connections between bats, bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases (except for rabies). However, we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses. In this review, we cover aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats. We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e611826a82dca5c69cd04efe41b3214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/155f7c13ccf1568707b0d31236aa9b65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21ea04d0ca29382ba80eedb0f4be3fe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dd71e1bd6104b82e576cfc035d7c207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/540dcaaff98cc3132159d8f2fef25fc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56bc429459e20f77eb04fe05dae6f9b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a4c27735fd601b245d4ba131d716e9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80acc3cf049cfb2b1a71241593aa6e9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/834d8148e593f06e0fd68e9f2ba277a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83df90c4045d1b217a5929a1be66a682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a687a927f330002d08bab7ac05d9f3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f54955dff7e6b01783fa0430c5497d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bd824cc0ff229dab2f5554729ad111e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2c111dc09b69f2b500984e6248ce274, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b84ba5ad55db3e40a2e91b99b9b5fc27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca7e3032c137caee88f1110f62058696, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2f4b1f1d9035b40afbd5bf133bf2c88"

To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the kinetics of RNA binding between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated infectious bronchitis virus N protein with nonviral and viral RNA by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). Mass spectroscopic analysis of N protein identified phosphorylation sites that were proximal to RNA binding domains. Kinetic analysis, by surface plasmon resonance, indicated that nonphosphorylated N protein bound with the same affinity to viral RNA as phosphorylated N protein. However, phosphorylated N protein bound to viral RNA with a higher binding affinity than nonviral RNA, suggesting that phosphorylation of N protein determined the recognition of virus RNA. The data also indicated that a known N protein binding site (involved in transcriptional regulation) consisting of a conserved core sequence present near the 5′ end of the genome (in the leader sequence) functioned by promoting high association rates of N protein binding. Further analysis of the leader sequence indicated that the core element was not the only binding site for N protein and that other regions functioned to promote high-affinity binding.",""

Recently, the prevailing hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) promote inflammation was challenged when polymorphisms in Ncf1, that decrease oxidative burst, were shown to increase disease severity in mouse and rat arthritis models. Based on these findings we developed a new therapy for arthritis using oxidative burst-inducing substances. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Treatment of rats with phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecene-1-ol) increased oxidative burst in vivo and thereby corrected the effect of the genetic polymorphism in arthritis-prone Ncf1 (DA) rats. Importantly, phytol treatment also decreased the autoimmune response and ameliorated both the acute and chronic phases of arthritis. When compared to standard therapies for RA, anti-tumour necrosis factor-α and methotrexate, phytol showed equally good or better therapeutic properties. Finally, phytol mediated its effect within hours of administration and involved modulation of T cell activation, as injection prevented adoptive transfer of disease with arthritogenic T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of arthritis with ROS-promoting substances such as phytol targets a newly discovered pathway leading to autoimmune inflammatory disease and introduces a novel class of therapeutics for treatment of RA and possibly other chronic inflammatory diseases.",""

The risk of developing childhood asthma has been linked to the severity and etiology of viral respiratory illnesses in early childhood. Since inner-city infants have unique environmental exposures, we hypothesized that patterns of respiratory viral infections would also be distinct. Methods. We compared the viral etiology of respiratory illnesses in 2 groups: a cohort of 515 infants from 4 inner-city areas and a cohort of 285 infants from mainly suburban Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal secretions were sampled during periods of respiratory illness and at 1 year of age and were analyzed for viral pathogens by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results. Overall, inner-city infants had lower rates of viral detection. Considering specific viruses, sick urban infants had lower rates of detectable rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus infection and higher rates of adenovirus infection. Every urban site had a higher proportion of adenovirus-positive samples associated with illnesses (10%–21%), compared with Madison (6%). Conclusions. These findings provide evidence that inner-city babies have different patterns of viral respiratory illnesses than babies who grow up in a more suburban location. These findings raise important questions about the etiology of virus-negative illnesses in urban infants and the possibility of long-term consequences of early life infections with adenovirus in this population.",""

Most studies addressing virulence factors of B. bronchiseptica utilize isolates derived from hosts other than pigs in conjunction with rodent infection models. Based on previous in vivo mouse studies, we hypothesized that the B. bronchiseptica type III secretion system (T3SS) would be required for maximal disease severity and persistence in the swine lower respiratory tract. To examine the contribution of the T3SS to the pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we compared the abilities of a virulent swine isolate and an isogenic T3SS mutant to colonize, cause disease, and be transmitted from host to host. We found that the T3SS is required for maximal persistence throughout the lower swine respiratory tract and contributed significantly to the development of nasal lesions and pneumonia. However, the T3SS mutant and the wild-type parent are equally capable of transmission among swine by both direct and indirect routes, demonstrating that transmission can occur even with attenuated disease. Our data further suggest that the T3SS skews the adaptive immune response in swine by hindering the development of serum anti-Bordetella antibody levels and inducing an interleukin-10 (IL-10) cell-mediated response, likely contributing to the persistence of B. bronchiseptica in the respiratory tract. Overall, our results demonstrate that the Bordetella T3SS is required for maximal persistence and disease severity in pigs, but not for transmission.",""

A graft-versus-host-like (GVHL) syndrome, characterized by widespread necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the bowel, skin, and other tissues, has also been observed after mercury treatment of BN rats. These findings have suggested that the autoimmunity caused by the administration of mercury to BN rats may result as a xenobiotic-induced GVHL effect under the control of OX22+ T lymphocytes. However, previous studies of mercury-induced autoimmunity have never reported any evidence of GVHL lesions. Therefore, we have carefully examined various tissues from a large group of BN rats injected with HgCl2 to identify possible areas of inflammatory reactions that may have been unnoticed in previous investigations. In addition, we have determined by flow cytometry whether exposure to mercury results in percentage and numerical alterations of OX22+ or other lymphocyte subpopulations in lymphoid organs of HgCl2-treated BN rats. The present article confirms that mercury induces autoimmune responses to laminin 1 but does not corroborate the hypothesis of a GVHL syndrome regulated by OX22+ lymphocytes. First, changes in OX22+ cells during treatment with HgCl2 were infrequent and had no significant correlation with the kinetics of autoimmune responses to laminin 1. Second, we detected no GVHL lesions in skin and intestine of mercury-treated BN rats.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c4f096221330f39602a3d069d1fdd59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c78a9fa8845f73cb0d33d84fe243ac7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24467238a106246944dfbb04a3c87b42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2720a5722f15a0d2d39cd55e12344e26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33496ae0b052b085335579f59f1bf761, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b4fd8e10619b3acc6d48a823777e388, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5068917269f02d25fc284a2d29bc7723, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55d87a49711523dfc6e16627b517477e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/679ed460757bcb4fb1945336d92936be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/719c6f6e4801e9010618201e1002bae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b5974a94bbddc841c77e4a225b98293, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c2d9173d26557fe68f5d965406779c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ec6318c9d4ddbbdb8825bcd2a098390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f114da005c26e1ca5affa0aabad10d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/842eff03199a73dc3b29bc7f6f594943, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dc07732781616f134e3413d8a8f9e18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/971b7187661961b286212e663e55ca02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9abc00efeb50cb20713c52daab7c012e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1c2bb96701d4d98acb1c8371bf36a9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b35634d43e2ead2aa386ca18bc8c0840, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ac08048207ad0d27d4d55a8741b8f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b735a8c4263a31e6cf7a029cec7a6fe9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c022df4a96157b59bf0d9d022d74e3c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0257e057489c54992016d28c291687f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb572c80fa6a43f4456f8d34fe7e37e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f15141af7577b1917c5a21176d056bc9"

Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion. MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain. Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00aa52eed8230ec8ddcf2e00e9278e21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/034783c5f1e7ed3156c1e5105f31fbc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0864c2f82216a7f358a1aa66fcba9b9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1308d989989b96f5f10d107d14b78790, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17d890e47b83e8a6c28f0ca7074d9337, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/331869caaf8ce0a61100477223efda46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/473f021c2a90dc29cd65d961d55653f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f4514c37152761f79ebc3f1cdcbba63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ad4065067e0d594a2ff107aaef8320b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69c4cc5ec319465fe715e89a935ccfda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/852d8edd352ff314a94c873e3bfc380c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91226b693d591dcebe2654a7aa6ea4d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97d80c69fea90b86f66b9a05672abb1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b363da661946b92526ad828630a31354, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b533e410e87ef94b24104f10004896b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be3e5acf1dc2fda16fb1e8c311295efb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c435a379ece8a8c65f718613b300552a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf59a4af5b3bb2310eade1d9762f8eb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0335bbf3c34aae8e61a65bc35f1b6c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d09cb6f4414c33713673df0ce4569411, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1470ad4c9a91864b077c75fe41a38d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d476db7c09b88432acc826285ddc408d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7c65117592dc60df081bea392103095, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da30259f82d68be0b4df9572b9f9fae8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddf237649ed4acdb2255cf78bb3aa64c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ead0d4f0dfc519672cef8ddc2be3da09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebdefe3bb02221d6be691da76418dec5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee9b1ae70072728968ff38e0be25cf32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f032b58e01584b2339fb1cea7d47a4e1"

We hypothesized that this variable outcome could correlate with the nature of responses made to previous microbes. To test this, mice were infected initially with IAV and in memory-phase challenged with LCMV, which we show here to have relatively minor cross-reactivity with IAV. The outcome in genetically identical mice varied from mild pneumonitis to severe acute lung injury with extensive pneumonia and bronchiolization, similar to that observed in patients that died of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Lesion expression did not correlate with virus titers. Instead, disease severity directly correlated with and was predicted by the frequency of IAV-PB1(703)- and -PA(224)-specific responses, which crossreacted with LCMV-GP(34) and -GP(276), respectively. Eradication or functional ablation of these pathogenic memory T-cell populations, using mutant-viral strains, peptide-based tolerization strategies, or short-term anti-IFNγ treatment inhibited severe lesions such as bronchiolization from occurring. Heterologous immunity can shape outcome of infections and likely individual responses to vaccination, and can be manipulated to treat or prevent severe pathology.",""

Clinically normal FCoV-infected cats living in catteries with a high prevalence of FIP had the highest serum IFN-γ concentrations. The serum concentration of IFN-γ was not significantly different in cats with FIP compared with clinically normal FCoV-infected animals living in catteries with a low prevalence of the disease. Moreover, the concentration of IFN-γ was significantly higher in the effusions than in the serum of cats with FIP, probably due to IFN-γ production within lesions. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a strong, ‘systemic’ cell mediated immune response in clinically normal, FCoV-infected cats and that a similar process, albeit at a tissue level, is involved in the pathogenesis of FIP.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31d50683474f5340ec7c601fe5cf9dd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41f618dd8e21fd0aaff4ad087f9207d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4707031d9af1f489dc2ef53bcb1aea2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/532d3488222a9e9b4e04e5cd8aa497c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55050b46ca95e1282f9d29bf4b40a4a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ce53686f2c0aa8de7c9001b495e8eef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69fe1c4ed51921f2a465e2516981c700, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc9dd273809a311de93dac0a6381a756, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d10533f8302c98e682681f050a6ad2e2"

Because some cases of viral hepatitis infections, including hepatitis B and C, are diagnosed as chronic and may be associated with various complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several studies focused on the roles played by the inflammation on the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis.

The mAb KEN-5 was originally reported to recognize rabbit CD5. However, KEN-5 binds almost exclusively to T cells and only to a minor population of B cells. We show here that by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), KEN-5 binds to recombinant rabbit CD5. This interaction is partially inhibited by polyclonal goat anti-CD5 antibody. In addition, immunoprecipitations from lysates of surface biotinylated rabbit lymphocytes with KEN-5 or our anti-CD5 mAb isolate molecules that migrate identically on gels with the same approximate relative molecular mass of 67,000 M(r). By flow cytometric analyses of individual cells from spleen, thymus and appendix, KEN-5 recognizes CD5-like molecules mainly on T cells and on 3-6% of IgM(+) B cells. Immunohistochemical staining of splenic and appendix tissues and confocal immunofluorescent imaging confirm and extend results from flow cytometric analyses. Quantitation of fluorescent colocalization indicates that staining by KEN-5 colocalizes with staining by anti-CD5 on small percentages lymphocytes in splenic tissue sections. As CD5 has both N- and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells. This hypothesis is supported by ELISA data that show that deglycosylation diminishes the binding of KEN-5 to recombinant rabbit CD5. Screening KEN-5 on an array with 406 glycans was inconclusive. Although we did not identify a strongly binding glycan structure, the data are suggestive that the epitope recognized by KEN-5 may be influenced by glycan structures. The epitope this mAb recognizes may either be the glycan itself, or more likely, is influenced by neighboring glycan structure. Our findings suggest that development, selection and function of different B- and T-cell subsets or their preferential survival may be directly or indirectly dependent on different glycan structures associated with CD5 or CD5-like molecules expressed on T cells compared to B cells.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0029058a1b1914521f4512246b923a03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03d986d5678406b4b1706b38d37abf14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eef6be3106b009b3b72dc7a439e7fcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fc3cc543a4d37ad001dcd7b54a24d4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27111d7a87da98b263cc90dae73bcb86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2edfe41343e045930f790e779ab1c048, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36e63da4ce3b86a0cd9333ddad91d9b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ad532c03f2f390519fac69e2c5fbeae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4375878e06bd654d4aa5e3538d1619c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5434b7d5a5855af2e7301689cea69ad6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55fd13671ae1129bf0dcfc6431dc2a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/607822e54e9b830bcf26c97fbb9550b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6821f8556bdc12a5190fb994d2ed46ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a62c20b75b6a8fd6797b6b2266099c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b25bca6f66c7205997a68e05ee7aa61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75ad44b721c853a2acb25a00e054d50a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77a5b8dbe6c0b6a78dbdd6aef67314bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78042294a42418772edfb6ab8a934361, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79025f5754222d49fffa0093a6ed1d18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80a6742911ba8a48e228b07308c9aac5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/867f3f606ae24ec6b6af6c5dd9a28f2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88255116150f159e7234ef7b737fc507, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c66d6870d36117497f7334eff07125a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/908ddfe260891aaf6debbe3221eb3874, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929d01b00fa5947b5756d9f35b541d42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f16ac447dd798390390a5886620374, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/940f899bb4930dff933b808bcd2a64d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/978c7b0c90e3ced616f024b1e99c7a53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a2a067df8ec82308b0fe4a6433a0b18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e5fc40e420f28b073f56f0610d93b9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a171c446cef43ef4be938c9b25edbfc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7e6e03a60dbe3372ff0843b1ff76b35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a82471a34de6026367162a82f4129081, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa38a1f0ecea990263d8e1cb5b6347af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac52c6d192f053d1177c21874dd0e5b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7a5975258e65611f2b77c7747ed71a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf3941ef88465ffea9887c0da65e40bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfecfd785987da5b8979e98f745aa30f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6e5a313bf9973b70a3becfd87e95b77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c89321dcb4e5c0fbda894468eda2b82c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccf16e5a6a2ba5fabd8c5757fa2169fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d093b1b6a9dca1a0185d3d0ab7cea548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d63a8cb0e56280c8070cfb0584985f18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d71662636d579bfb116b982f9271b030, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dac7c394c2f247a80173320302db4a70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcbe67bc2e24d1f2e463b6d65177c27f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6f6264b694f13ce96632230bae65244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eaf10fcdf979f6fead6a4df7c673be96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f36722a51a1aa2d3f62c19e7bd001b48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6df2520a526bf2925f155167d7a86e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f71b29e74a1ff90c4cd6f8c77381c08e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f803e8bdd2cc911dbb31147029d3720e"

Curiously, this variant A372V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity. Our results uncover a new antiviral approach based on mutagenesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0325d86e4d3066af082eb392af206fcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a0058fbfa050288ff8baed4d1cc49cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a674ed99aa72570928946f1b518c6f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f23d2b4020c38a253a075f97007027b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3858b36a78fdf953c6d6eebf51135ec5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4602199362770d8ce6ef613101c3e419, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61b420efd9fe1865461877a96bd12d68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61e9196f85afaedb77b183c42b97af11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75f71ce6e6533672835e1d9532454afc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8544c7bc4aa0ff1391af944cdf37b7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c524c4e6916d78f60cc004914c45b27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d0b08b4d4a7b398fb229200531d6b9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9545f59c6a9b6df57fe89d6240daf4af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b73aa1ff63dd75d5d49b660eb445445, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0fe1fe44e4cae068c7b15c333782466, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8d9dfa970a4ea39c8d8610f075b59e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acf51006ead930e59c471eec25bdfd1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae04ae7f60aa4bb9df3fab5c01f676e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae527a5d3c0499657520b18d0f8b91fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1ae810a9b11e4b4696c691259cc7809, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b29cff2fea2517ee1a8aee729568276d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd9d9375f6c16f3ba4860b22f4aaa007, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4b025fde3d0c6a5f88ba685170791e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6b658c1dc107a329bc6b1c35ed35721, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5fafae090381acc9587eebc0926fe45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8bfe87b9925b82dbe0513e860f658b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d940da70848c776fad2fca1cf78011d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd86eb509fcf464c49fd5b61bd862f98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e29b17acc276fdc32a46c856f66a667e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6e3c8d093a7bcb7946c34f6cb7d11e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea1d059ea13075c0a27549f6e14d7c67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f21055e12d9c7ea111592b13ff521fd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faacab5991b9b7d3e25609c281f81449"

We hypothesized that the association and intense utilization of the ER during viral replication would induce the cellular unfolded protein response (UPR), a signal transduction cascade that acts to modulate translation, membrane biosynthesis, and the levels of ER chaperones. Here, we report that infection by the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) triggers the proximal UPR transducers, as revealed by monitoring the IRE1-mediated splicing of XBP-1 mRNA and the cleavage of ATF6α. However, we detected minimal downstream induction of UPR target genes, including ERdj4, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein, and p58(IPK), or expression of UPR reporter constructs. Translation initiation factor eIF2α is highly phosphorylated during MHV infection, and translation of cellular mRNAs is attenuated. Furthermore, we found that the critical homeostasis regulator GADD34, which recruits protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α during the recovery phase of the UPR, is not expressed during MHV infection. These results suggest that MHV modifies the UPR by impeding the induction of UPR-responsive genes, thereby favoring a sustained shutdown of the synthesis of host cell proteins while the translation of viral proteins escalates. The role of this modified response and its potential relevance to viral mechanisms for the evasion of innate defense signaling pathways during coronavirus replication are discussed.",""

To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-γ synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α/β) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-α, IFN-β or IFN-γ alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-α and IFN-γ or IFN-β and IFN-γ inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-α/β and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN-γ produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f38a9ed833f49461ac0467bfe350dbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32fabd152e8e4ec4b4618dbe12002f23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d0318fdf4605e9c3c670abb26f07833, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d8ecf3f21a67591d9b93088cba41f9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88a2cce369acc36caf6cc2c3605fa986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d314a53353544c5ac84af0f628a4ebd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a22ae6d5e4b052f37613d091d4807317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c387c30c5920d6be923af30c84949414, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbfeea7ae4f63cd08f958a27a0ab28c2"

Knowledge about the enzymes (writers and erasers) that attach and remove post-translational modifications, the targets that are modified and the functional consequences elicited by specific modifications, is crucial for understanding cell biological processes. Moreover detailed knowledge about these mechanisms and pathways helps to elucidate the molecular causes of various diseases and in defining potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation refers to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent modification of proteins with ADP-ribose and is catalyzed by enzymes of the ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin like, also known as PARP) family as well as some members of the Sirtuin family. Poly-ADP-ribosylation is relatively well understood with inhibitors being used as anti-cancer agents. However, the majority of ARTD enzymes and the ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins are restricted to catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation. Although writers, readers and erasers of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation have been identified only recently, it is becoming more and more evident that this reversible post-translational modification is capable of modulating key intracellular processes and signaling pathways. These include signal transduction mechanisms, stress pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules, and chromatin-associated processes such as transcription and DNA repair. We hypothesize that mono-ADP-ribosylation controls, through these different pathways, the development of cancer and infectious diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05b732d770e3985a3613ab498ecfda4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cdf66ea8ad8bd20eea77ad845a10593, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e3b5ef877f1f59875e3289f7cb744b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ffc356c823e3f4785b7aa1e4f4e2fb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/133303f090fd5f35d99f6be66429cd7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/174f5aee0b484550f1a92095db6b19d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a441c108a22b8a32dc8784b7d390d06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e9413e1aa3d5cbc1f3dbce04f6e2639, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ec47e9f0b4f8553724680c9736405fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/461e67dd18ca6136877a7b7da88e7344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62e0cd6a8dd1b862a937245e2b9c2af5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e33ecec954d0a9cfdf9039075899e18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73b6e9ce4c0ee408a712a740600bb80c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79dcb443dcc9b06fc43364285eb06cb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e097a9f0c392196e62a36bacd6ba111, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81895d7315c8b412d7e2e5665615aa0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/836b2e3126eda88d8b4e0dc42aacf8ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/912722c02cc07fd1b8104c5ed3da9365, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b6b4a0941c730be1ab1bf978bff5c08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abb0b5b7a173effe5e4d3856d0563d3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcc078d6735ea6f5ac784b6607ac3417, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be89b174597f8b268adcf2b703f3defd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf8af47b8d3ab3d974d07dc25e0b0e03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0c0826e4026e0a58716a5fc163737b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2f02d09d2c807db52cd9b6383c4178d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9925a6ab070b7db7548f8c6c9c37f67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d16f961bd1e5c2c6a13bed81838f50f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbf7d530eadbed066dd4888f5d554f13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e61ea97814ee76b538832987e7ca70f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6f98038f1a847e1b9aed53d5b7c9871, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0191f8c6f25e737a7630daadc0d01a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d1598fa26afbdb33f50fd1307a739c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd3b4ea3044fcc84d600827bd5cda6af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffe1f2569853677d2173e58f90a8ebd8"

In a quest for such bn Abs, phage- and yeast-displayed antibody libraries, constructed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a patient with bn serum containing Abs targeting the epitope of the bn MAb 2F5, were panned against peptides containing the 2F5 epitope and against the HIV-1 gp140(JR-FL). Two MAbs (m66 and m66.6) were identified; the more mutated variant (m66.6) exhibited higher HIV-1-neutralizing activity than m66, although it was weaker than 2F5 in a TZM-bl cell assay. Binding of both MAbs to gp41 alanine substitution mutant peptides required the DKW(664–666) core of the 2F5 epitope and two additional upstream residues (L(660,663)). The MAbs have long (21-residue) heavy-chain third complementarity-determining regions (CDR-H3s), and m66.6 (but not m66) exhibited polyspecific reactivity to self- and non-self-antigens. Both m66 and m66.6 are significantly less divergent from their germ line Ab counterparts than 2F5—they have a total of 11 and 18 amino acid changes, respectively, from the closest VH and Vκ germ line gene products compared to 25 for 2F5.

The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing, etc. The significance of CpG island methylation status in normal development, cell differentiation and gene expression is widely recognized, although still stays poorly understood. METHODS: We performed whole genome DNA methylation array analysis on DNA pool samples from peripheral blood from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy individuals. This technique allowed us to determine the methylation status of 27 627 CpG islands throughout the whole genome in healthy controls and BEN patients. Thus we obtained the methylation profile of BEN patients from Bulgarian and Serbian endemic regions. RESULTS: Using specifically developed software we compared the methylation profiles of BEN patients and corresponding controls and revealed the differently methylated regions. We then compared the DMRs between all patient-control pairs to determine common changes in the epigenetic profiles. SEC61G, IL17RA, HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs. The CpG islands of all 3 genes were hypomethylated compared to controls. This suggests that dysregulation of these genes involved in immunological response could be a common mechanism in BEN pathogenesis in both endemic regions and in both genders. CONCLUSION: Our data propose a new hypothesis that immunologic dysregulation has a place in BEN etiopathogenesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bdd087a295ec4c424148849c2e27d10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cc8206ea03098400a2e2fc9d2ea4a1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bafc574b2636652431ce73d1ae7285b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26495a2eb6f1ab8d4b83e814cb2d6b3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b28efe6bad60902fffd275dd8c260f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b88b0034cf8dbe1ae6521ce6cf57642, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/301f9a4a4b88b02e5f3764b957beb7ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3204457219f03491c28362029a00734d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32538825e8bbd4d0124671d8ca2012b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3559a2afb27e129e78b75230bfea3ed9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b4cc6d3829f5dc3c1c4e947d76c66b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cd5b66f98a92322a5f8393f47c399ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fb2445bdbd6b1c98f4f1c760db88102, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/539d52bd3fa3ba19ddc5d7109bc79b0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55d3a32148ca35a030e517f7bad51c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/560c49095950247f53b471cc6739354c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/560d1e97691ef899605947c9906a3a3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d3b1f513109517f7b4b479cf5737f6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ee0ac041f258e8fc6fd14798ef48109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66bb375788ba25f7c914afea1c1990b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8814d7366234a895402b9f721c85018b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88bad39afc38dc0284647723fb1921c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d04099dbf6afb4adf13c47fd837f56c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e31bf7bff72dab48066ecc1cafb5ba0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f9b3eae4d02393e46db58e1f911e058, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/956f8c33bad9c71ba8db0e42bfa05b4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/982b46f8af50ddcd76a2f177e5ce9ed2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9db5db615ea86fbfdaa2f6157f44bc07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e5194d46fe21dc1e593a6b498754ed9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4e900a82bc00184f7b88dc33f258f22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5dc028496bbaca6dd42c99919844f3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0768f1a7c0b13335cb84f5cf8b6c964, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8a532e5c427a9fa0998b052777da5d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7e54a0d09f3eaf950f6f5cb989869a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd9dc940499a0b410d511621546565d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d035092ba9a6e8f8d0d225639d24daa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d41ff84bd8a21697b018c9c5a673ce18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d743363e0ca6afe417acf4200e0ec616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d92ca4e26e5da0b4af2a1c944a88160a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e899a4d945f1600802eb5eed88ff3723, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef5bf930efa1b5c642b35fa95f86b26c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe06b9cab879c8585a6ab1b8869f8f91"

The detrimental effects of such treatment on the bone mineral density (BMD) of SARS patients are unknown. To compare the BMD of SARS patients with normal range data, a cross-sectional survey was conducted. The bone mineral density of 224 patients with SARS, who were treated with an average of 2753 mg (SD = 2152 mg) prednisolone and 29,344 mg (SD = 15,849 mg) of ribarivin was compared to normal data. Six percent of men had a hip BMD Z score of ≤−2 (P = 0.057 for testing the hypothesis that >2.5% of subjects should have a Z score of ≤−2). Moreover, there was a negative association (r = −0.25, P = 0.023) between the duration of steroid therapy and BMD in men. We conclude that male SARS patients had lower BMD at the hip than normal controls, and this could be attributed to prolonged steroid therapy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6910ccbc2d8b380d9d0a49b310323811, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9033a96412d20d5f74c47b8667333ac3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b346e53ebf449646ea29cc68128a63ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c24c8bb3c7a26dc49e12dcc10234caaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e717b348339fe167761c2a7477ce9fe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f44bf48a48c806fcebdb9dd29639880d"

One such isolate, a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, was partially induced for lactose operon expression in tryptone containing media, and was also pathogenic in a rabbit ileal loop model for NEC. A spontaneous segregant of this strain was no longer partially induced for lactose operon expression, and was no longer pathogenic in the rabbit model. The gene responsible for this phenotype was cloned. The resulting plasmid was shown to cause both partially induced lactose operon expression and pathogenicity when introduced into a laboratory K. pneumoniae strain. A K. pneumoniae mutant deficient in lactose repressor synthesis was also pathogenic in the rabbit model. These results and previous studies on the intraluminal biochemistry of infants with NEC support the hypothesis that an increased ability for lactose fermentation may be a bacterial pathogenic trait with respect to NEC.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c3d6c32a63fe6f39b1360beced6e012, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b4f25218eb121306c5dcac874d76311, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bb3d610298063bdf00a84bafecc7405, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ee82b865da7f27af1de61a21ff04eba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47285e6a53f9bc19c0a87eb6e741d467, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f1201ad20415833a354b9d2cc8781e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51f92a67dd83533aa1e2223f485aa453, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c794cba535fa2fcc80567f43b5e5151, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f901f3b20343c129a00632f7fe61e23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6723000c0d19d09432f50966cfdf9d20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79eb50629afd5ed3f6a9a0fbed1cacef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/874f0281ef0524fd3fec4ad04869d375, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/960114961ef807c1bcfa75a56650b56d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98a4f2423170faa8183ea8855b504737, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a477261e5d1a3213385cdc897aa27ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ed26311db7dd0801fd832c77cc482e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a15af7001241524fe4fa575f2bd7fb06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4780d7b8763dd40679b7703f9a2b42b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a94069bcca0a7670adb458afc9b5d618, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba33d17b159342ad93ff359170e1afbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baca6bc36d3423a6e3f460e5d6ab1d1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c013ef7ed977900923d931ad2d804ca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7e67d56555c1749547f4083e32b3637, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc2f5fe9f20b4114fa0a0cf1ca3457fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce0d23720f9cf1ea75b6ce5b42088997, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf909b578eb9785baa42691d42bc9fd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2fb2f924e0938f26d5d33baa9c5db75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d89299e9f78fc2685ee3d1a1317091b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df6b7d7f0ec81037336d7c3d700fb357, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3b4393318fb1c4173d81a3ca7a452b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e968b2716959d23d3a318828d41d390e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2596a42477a32b8d1ad21238aceaabf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f64e1f50a54a3f2e3962829dd14e90a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa236e5e04960a397ced1b96b896af2f"

Here, the authors analyzed previously unpublished documents from a large household survey of the “Spanish” H1N1 influenza pandemic, conducted in 1918, for the first time quantifying influenza transmissibility at the person-to-person level during that most lethal of pandemics. The authors estimated a low probability of person-to-person transmission relative to comparable estimates from seasonal influenza and other directly transmitted infections but similar to recent estimates from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The authors estimated a very low probability of asymptomatic infection, a previously unknown parameter for this pandemic, consistent with an unusually virulent virus. The authors estimated a high frequency of prior immunity that they attributed to a largely unreported influenza epidemic in the spring of 1918 (or perhaps to cross-reactive immunity). Extrapolating from this finding, the authors hypothesize that prior immunity partially protected some populations from the worst of the fall pandemic and helps explain differences in attack rates between populations. Together, these analyses demonstrate that the 1918 influenza virus, though highly virulent, was only moderately transmissible and thus in a modern context would be considered controllable.",""

Although glial cells are the principal target of JCV productive infection in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy patients, little is known regarding the site of JCV persistence and the mechanisms by which the virus spreads to the CNS to cause disease. Previous work has demonstrated the presence of replicating JCV DNA in B lymphocytes from peripheral blood, tonsil, and spleen and it has been hypothesized that lymphocytes may be one site of JCV persistence. Detection of viral gene products in renal tubules and excretion of JC virions in the urine suggests JCV persistence in the kidney. A respiratory route of viral transmission has also been hypothesized implicating the lung as another possible site of persistent JCV infection. Earlier studies from our laboratory have shown that terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid is a critical component of the JCV receptor. In this report we examined the tissue distribution of this JCV receptor-type sialic acid in a panel of normal human tissues. Our results demonstrate that in normal brain JCV receptor-type sialic acids are expressed on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, but not on cortical neurons. The receptor-type sialic acid is also more highly expressed on B lymphocytes than on T lymphocytes in normal human spleen and tonsil. In addition, both the kidney and lung express abundant levels of α2-6-linked sialic acids. Our data show a striking correlation between the expression of the JCV receptor-type sialic acid on cells and their susceptibility to infection by the virus. These findings also support the hypothesis of JCV persistence in lymphoid tissue and B-cell-facilitated viral dissemination to the CNS.",""

It is due to mutations in the influenza virus genetic material creating antigenic drift of pathogenic viral proteins resulting in emergence of new influenza virus strains. Therefore, the vaccines available for prevention of influenza offer no protection against influenza pandemics caused by new virus strains. Moreover, the existing drugs used to combat influenza may be ineffective to treat influenza pandemics due to the emergence of drug resistance in the pandemic virus strain. Therefore, a working strategy must be developed to combat influenza pandemics. In this review we have addressed this problem and reviewed the published studies on ascorbic acid in the common cold and influenza and laboratory studies on the effect of ascorbic acid on influenza virus.

In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that wolves are susceptible to CaKoV infections. A total of 185 wolf stool samples were collected from necropsied animals and from transects in the Liguria, Piemonte and Valle D’Aosta regions of Italy, and CaKoV RNA was identified in two of these specimens. Both samples were obtained from necropsied wolves, with a prevalence rate of 4.9% (2/41). Sequence analysis of the full-length VP1 region showed that these strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) sequence identity (86.3-98.5%) to canine strains identified in the UK and Africa, and to kobuviruses that were previously detected in other African wild carnivores. This suggests that genetically related CaKoV strains circulate in domestic and wild carnivores, with interspecies transmission being not uncommon among carnivores of different ecosystems.",""

Reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns; ancestral (1987–1997), contemporary (2004–2009), and broad (1987–2009). NVB 114 reacted exclusively to the earliest GII.4 VLPs by EIA and blockade. NVB 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary GII.4 VLPs, while NBV 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the GII.4.2006 Minerva strain. Three mAbs had broad GII.4 reactivity. Two, NVB 37.10 and 61.3, also detected other genogroup II VLPs by EIA but did not block any VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands. NVB 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered GII.4 VLPs, as measured by VLP-carbohydrate blockade assays. Using mutant VLPs designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes, two evolving, GII.4-specific, blockade epitopes were mapped. Amino acids 294–298 and 368–372 were required for binding NVB 114, 111 and 43.9 mAbs. Amino acids 393–395 were essential for binding NVB 97, supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation. These data inform VLP vaccine design, provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines, and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10e703a4967638dc4903adf583618a6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17a135e51e7dda2a1c26711d9d1d7fc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ad3b1a6ac8d56a163232581c9c667ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/221554a44a6e660eac38755c0fa44fbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32e7a34ed787841aef060ce8c3670da4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34b3fc6ab252463e051e596fc355d34f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35d0a55c1de4490ce636f67e2cc88bda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b979fedbb204df582cb70a5fa3f69c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56c6db5a2a2dba3f27523cafca9c171a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5efabd844d78656b7190e81cb0d68cd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6043e78ca6e165490beba17cfac02e99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b494dc0a55dd23525098917c9e2f99a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6db41a29d0131573616de03b36cf7e04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/779053604faa776ebc9f2eb8ee3a395e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79ce983061c2b17862d512a0d907442f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80f2df7c5a7d4fc44e412fe0f0f5744c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8584901411679099f4463dac39cfe422, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87c71b2e198c331e13816332e0f3d35e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a449b0a09de6ce2cdf9ebb7d2e6ac7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9152e8e3a3475c659ab2ae60e570f20e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/974fe6271cb39e03f73e4c27ded1128c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ada6bb13b7c305198ebeed984d1c1ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b5decaeeeb39f85016d724f8504c372, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d8e862b25a73b1b16577430209e1cad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f9d146e51d1402f5fab530cdbcfae3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a12993082b5eb8443c611d09a8a8bec6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a747db4fa4fec18161b48315c82ab983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac9ba7ccf3539ef08b9dcc7d9e191d82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bea6835f8ec7cbdd5c854b75097cfe9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4c941de60ec9fe35a662a578a4c4a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d19ae4acafb0c9ea5c7b8314e5925ab4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d80240769692f7dbf50df58dfc3f2682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db0e58c6ef67b499461cd9297e93844d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddfb8e843cc4551b26659c12fc95b4f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df508bcc2f89503e29a7abc1780c4efe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e16c73d1f4b0821552bb2c1e69ba110d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9aa326fd7ba6bee17a2ce562e6794ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edbe35baf028858d479015aaa29e799b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0544d7b23c6ad873af286aa94d84eda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f254503a3959a2a13fe653df806b2f53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f72b0210e54c04a5f4224685a0025be2"

A mouse model of acute SARS-CoV infection has been helpful in understanding the host response to infection; however, there are still unanswered questions concerning SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We have shown that STAT1 plays an important role in the severity of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and that it is independent of the role of STAT1 in interferon signaling. Mice lacking STAT1 have greater weight loss, severe lung pathology with pre-pulmonary-fibrosis-like lesions, and an altered immune response following infection with SARS-CoV. We hypothesized that STAT1 plays a role in the polarization of the immune response, specifically in macrophages, resulting in a worsened outcome. To test this, we created bone marrow chimeras and cell-type-specific knockouts of STAT1 to identify which cell type(s) is critical to protection from severe lung disease after SARS-CoV infection. Bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that hematopoietic cells are responsible for the pathogenesis in STAT1(−/−) mice, and because of an induction of alternatively activated (AA) macrophages after infection, we hypothesized that the AA macrophages were critical for disease severity. Mice with STAT1 in either monocytes and macrophages (LysM/STAT1) or ciliated lung epithelial cells (FoxJ1/STAT1) deleted were created. Following infection, LysM/STAT1 mice display severe lung pathology, while FoxJ1/STAT1 mice display normal lung pathology. We hypothesized that AA macrophages were responsible for this STAT1-dependent pathology and therefore created STAT1/STAT6(−/−) double-knockout mice. STAT6 is essential for the development of AA macrophages. Infection of the double-knockout mice displayed a lack of lung disease and prefibrotic lesions, suggesting that AA macrophage production may be the cause of STAT1-dependent lung disease. We propose that the control of AA macrophages by STAT1 is critical to regulating immune pathologies and for protection from long-term progression to fibrotic lung disease in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection.",""

Viral nuclear import antagonists, expressed by several highly pathogenic RNA viruses, likely mediate pleiotropic effects on host gene expression, presumably interfering with transcription factors, cytokines, hormones, and/or signaling cascades that occur in response to infection. By bioinformatic and systems biology approaches, we evaluated the impact of nuclear import antagonism on host expression networks by using human lung epithelial cells infected with either wild-type virus or a mutant that does not express ORF6 protein. Microarray analysis revealed significant changes in differential gene expression, with approximately twice as many upregulated genes in the mutant virus samples by 48 h postinfection, despite identical viral titers. Our data demonstrated that ORF6 protein expression attenuates the activity of numerous karyopherin-dependent host transcription factors (VDR, CREB1, SMAD4, p53, EpasI, and Oct3/4) that are critical for establishing antiviral responses and regulating key host responses during virus infection. Results were confirmed by proteomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay analyses and in parallel microarray studies using infected primary human airway epithelial cell cultures. The data strongly support the hypothesis that viral antagonists of nuclear import actively manipulate host responses in specific hierarchical patterns, contributing to the viral pathogenic potential in vivo. Importantly, these studies and modeling approaches not only provide templates for evaluating virus antagonism of nuclear import processes but also can reveal candidate cellular genes and pathways that may significantly influence disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in vivo.",""

Recent evidence suggests that immune suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is mediated by type I IFN; however, it is unclear how type I IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD4(+) Th cell responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that type I IFN signaling directly impairs cDC function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific IFNAR1-deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that type I IFN signaling directly affects cDC function, limiting the ability of cDCs to prime IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells. Although type I IFN signaling modulated all subsets of splenic cDCs, CD8(–) cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced phagocytic and Th1-promoting properties in response to type I IFNs. Additionally, rapid and systemic IFN-α production in response to Plasmodium infection required type I IFN signaling in cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation of type I IFN signaling in CD8(–) splenic cDCs as an approach for enhancing Th1 responses against Plasmodium and other type I IFN–inducing pathogens.",""

Marmota himalayana is endemic to the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, China. Here, based on a high-throughput method using Illumina RNA sequencing, we studied the RNA virome of M. himalayana and discovered multiple novel viruses, especially picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which have a bi-segmented genome and belong to the family Picobirnaviridae. A total of 63% of the viral contigs corresponded to PBVs, comprising 274 segment 1 and 56 segment 2 sequences. Unexpectedly, four unsegmented PBV genomes were also detected and confirmed by PCR and resequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the following nine PBV assortment types are proposed: C1:GI, C2:GIV, C4:GI, C4:GV, C5:GI, C7:GI, C8:GIV, C8:GV and C8:GII. We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG. The model is supported by detection of the segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG not only in the 5′ untranslated regions of segment 1 (221 in 289) and segment 2 (57 in 80) of bi-segmented PBVs but also in the 5′ untranslated regions and junction sequences between the capsid and RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs. Therefore, with RNA sequencing, we found an unexpected biodiversity of PBVs in M. himalayana, indicating that M. himalayana is a special host for PBVs. We also proposed a putative model of how bi-segmented PBVs could be converted into unsegmented PBVs, which sheds new light on the processes of RNA virus genome evolution.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/019b4416d4ccb37333246f0c9af334ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0313e8c3309019796041fb89cc4619b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c3695a9640b0a31afb6a3c89b3dad78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28c4fdf38d8922264bca4e9b06e84925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36a6f651708e7fa9446b2a4bcaa3eca6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53502b987eb6e4d9106886341825ff5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/582017355f9826b2a719591e2b15b312, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/591fa03ec787216357e3a962e0aef7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c89bbda294120ce5277a01d8ff2075a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ce50843c361a5004ee34c7b3374a34e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e488713a651a945b4a25c2c58d9bc7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62226708ae8fb05cb9fd9a778d63ab04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63d339600e029eb799b34a8746c6721c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ad5c8fdf5fa08ba743f8a0e71bed496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78398159fcc118a46ce2c7e68efbbe69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c5d1fcde9a003e849e1b528fc9c9b29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9722ffb692c2f78862e66b70a99ea4c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97bce04d76b76ae3a8b6228bf93610f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a70f0c4a8ef54ee9f62ff9554c7601b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a83e8edba2c0b13ec30a641e94ba8b64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c149ad4746c48deb24aa3516478eba88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2fb1303cfebc43bd650dade4311bef5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d46ff9f2512115e87457f9cb5c9e71f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6191ed15815255239b281e19dbc677f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db2c8a2866c72c1e6ba793069f7da3f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9705f46abc2335b549e343de7ca825d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9d3c7b5f9f65dac3c999930823ff8ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef2f130bb70436b666289c99f408e30f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f32f3041923dff2311060daa4828b2b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4af6b7739e375dae091732369c809c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7733a58ded2cbd89e6ae81790376cc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffb5d2064c9486391339a703b93481da"

Although the limitation of the assumptions in a well-mixed model is well known, there has been very little research reported in the published literature on the discrepancy of exposure assessments between numerical models which take account of gravitational effects and the well-mixed model. A new Eulerian-type drift-flux model has been developed to simulate particle dispersion and personal exposure in a two-zone geometry, which accounts for the drift velocity resulting from gravitational settling and diffusion. To validate the numerical model, a small-scale chamber was fabricated. The airflow characteristics and particle concentrations were measured by a phase Doppler Anemometer. Both simulated airflow and concentration profiles agree well with the experimental results. A strong inhomogeneous concentration was observed experimentally for 10μm aerosols. The computational model was further applied to study a simple hypothetical, yet more realistic scenario. The aim was to explore different levels of exposure predicted by the new model and the well-mixed model. Aerosols are initially uniformly distributed in one zone and subsequently transported and dispersed to an adjacent zone through an opening. Owing to the significant difference in the rates of transport and dispersion between aerosols and gases, inferred from the results, the well-mixed model tends to overpredict the concentration in the source zone, and under-predict the concentration in the exposed zone. The results are very useful to illustrate that the well-mixed assumption must be applied cautiously for exposure assessments as such an ideal condition may not be applied for coarse particles.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aec98e063d7abddd99513f8935393c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/781b0adcbe10e73023dcca1cd3353fe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/943143c8af091eec56e0bbaaf71129af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2bf98a7f7c1309bcf655e40bb40514e"

The serological hallmark of PBC is the presence of high-titer antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) against the inner lipoyl domain of E2 subunits of 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes, in particular the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). The initiating events triggering the autoimmune response are not yet identified but the hypothesis of molecular mimicry is a widely proposed mechanism for the development of autoimmunity in PBC. Several candidates, including bacteria and viruses have been suggested as causative agents, but also environmental factors, such as chemical xenobiotics, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis. In this review, we will discuss our current knowledge of the immunoreactivity of xenobiotically modified PDC peptide antigens. In addition, we will provide a working hypothesis how xenobiotic modification of antigens might occur that ultimately leads to the breaking of self-tolerance and the induction of PBC.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00a8bb414788b64097b280854eebc6e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/147fc92bcbb2bd0b0e6c0064990178f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/162882bcd9253534242e096930fb706b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cb3ff54f00829c7def221fb467ec026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e0abdedb0164cbfe7bebe71c9868f10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36542ff48953a267824250cf0abd9c92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36920816cdf7c6d4de1d43e5365a46bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c3d8d6cfe585f27fbac664bc1b33656, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4052b9b7f83aa024d2a7e1fa7f0ee0e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4600c692db903e7dd370d22838e7e21f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bb767a7a702089c1bf582f20d91a464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6434bcaad32b2417c9afbba4a9b575e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/660039c2b40db2107be30b2950caf4b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690093acff148537e3f1e055fe2c7230, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c87fc772a5498dd4fd054235c335e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8634795042be53360e55b1a58f7f97c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/918c8dc91039713c55912cf8e96aea9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919c009af19723e22d2422b9fa390406, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9740410534cb0cbc8ed64d9cc65c4f90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3e5eb8a67ca167c6e63567f2e9f648f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad068411d4d900407e61598c54bde873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b59869c2d9248c39eba44091195478ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6706cfd50ad129ef9efb7697e7d311e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2a324b34930167143a2f8bdc86f3a95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d98bed9456b584928706c9bf302326ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eefba1d4373423ef18a642fd0a64d370, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f192c73fc06c6085ebb8fabe8a0b05cd"

Contrary to previous findings with neural cells from the rat (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, 1985, Virology 141, 89–101), these agents show no discrimination in the tropism and have the ability to replicate in either type of murine glial cell. Effects of the differentiation inducer dbcAMP on levels of the myelin-specific enzyme 2′:3′-cyclic nucleotide-3′-phosphohydrolase (CNPase) activity and virus replication were determined. In the mouse system there was a gradual, continuous elevation of CNPase beyond 30 days whereas in comparable rat cell cultures maximum CNPase enhancement is elicited within 21 days (F. A. McMorris,1983, J. Neurochem. 41, 506–515). After dbcAMP treatment replication of both coronaviruses was profoundly suppressed in murine oligodendrocytes, consistent with our findings on JHMV replication in treated rat oligodendrocytes. By contrast the replication of JHMV and MHV3 in dbcAMP-treated murine astrocytes was influenced only marginally. These findings provide further support for the hypothesis that susceptibility of rodents to CNS infection by coronaviruses is determined, in part, by the age-related maturation process of oligodendrocytes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ef42b08afdac6578d9b96fbf04fce8b"

TGEV transmission can be prevented if local immunity is established with increased lymphocytes. The current parenteral mode of vaccination stimulates systemic immunity well, but it does not induce sufficient mucosal immunity. Retinoic acid (RA) plays an important role in the induction of cells that imprint gut-homing molecules. We examined whether RA assist parenteral vaccination of pigs could improve mucosal immunity. We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8(+) T cells (which express α4β7 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa. Porcine T-cells expressed β7 integrin and CCR9 receptors and migrated to CCL25 by a mechanism that was dependent of activation by RA-pretreated DCs, rather than direct activation by RA. Together, our results provide powerful evidence that RA can assist whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) via subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization to generate intestinal immunity, and offer new vaccination strategies against TGEV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16bb056a8368de808cf557bbcc2ab4fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6798887d58577d0afb0242f1ebf4a6b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82024ea0ac9c64f1476be29a76e326ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89ef727b97066e4bc9c15d7fc8e730c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/926691deb500dd744d28b795205fd2a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b58ab0993fa6dcf59407d45cc10cf88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5a1f28f7e476b4e5028724695e3f960, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca6b52faa8272e5cfac9fe92435f0a57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d404e7283a4be5a6f4a428e83886c8a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc9105fb768d8a71b2579cfecaf4a68c"

The interaction between virus and host cells, critical for viral replication, is being extensively investigated by many laboratories. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1. The mechanisms of induction are mediated, at least in part, by signaling pathways such as NFκB and CREB. METHODS: SIRC, VERO, and 293HEK cell lines were infected with HSV-1, and the Egr-1 transcript and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The localization and expression profile of Egr-1 were investigated further by immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. The recruitment of transcription factors to the Egr-1 promoter during infection was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Various inhibitors and dominant-negative mutant were used to assess the mechanisms of Egr-1 induction and their effects were addressed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Western blot analyses showed that Egr-1 was absent in uninfected cells; however, the protein was detected 24-72 hours post treatment, and the response was directly proportional to the titer of the virus used for infection. Using recombinant HSV-1 expressing EGFP, Egr-1 was detected only in the infected cells. ChIP assays demonstrated that NFкB and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were recruited to the Egr-1 promoter upon infection. Additional studies showed that inhibitors of NFкB and dominant-negative CREB repressed the Egr-1 induction by HSV-1 infection. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that Egr-1 is expressed rapidly upon HSV-1 infection and that this novel induction could be due to the NFкB/CREB-mediated transactivation. Egr-1 induction might play a key role in the viral gene expression, replication, inflammation, and the disease progression.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03b6aea4891f2cb8a64e587d2f4eaf22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0767521eb0cf97d27e81de487cb723f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0779b8140e35210e9225c1f3e3f535f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a3bc601f81131dffa86c70f9ee68da7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10716f75812ef62ebae4200969ee1923, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15360e3a8477f89725e245d331e7757f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/196c454c9737f556d7f99f016357bb0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e131ec0ca70d54fc404db8ce0966bff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22cfe2f2ddfab219fe54a074f609b494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c07e1172c5bd53bd99d0d49a309325a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e50333d38b53ba1865dcd19e1d01d1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3370589089b91a1d8d9ed2ab1616c89d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33962adacd7e57b6ef1deddb868308d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38f13225dbf68503a1caf2ed9965f585, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4342b6163840982cf9663e6229d7489b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5272e19cac0798bed23a1b10da60481c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55a0d4015b4d987fa1b0921005db4188, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e02fc3a681736c3dbd08c5b49220c00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/623aa4f61840ecb9a25126dbd4273ca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65e01bfe3e5a0b5fd3e08fa3e5ce19d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d633522462801f8bdba5040f3420427, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7754285f4f1ba4f88407ffc4004128f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82b43299c6ce591b75797e261300e4f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b216563a7a198415980497881c41e59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91e8ccc51959795b9224e0ac00457e5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9391d72d4009c04e3df6e9c68653bc7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99e35ae7ca810ec430dfdbc00c6f96f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bfa9cd5f7bb0690423e2b8d867f1043, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f8f9ad9b6cf647057981d2f9241954e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4d9f9de65b32d01e040a3179aceac69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a68644d98c91874003ab003a38483dfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b49241efa7a39dd7277c8e4b2513549d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b49a6d4f07d3f0ad7974f8ac61d38786, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5d74201d553b800f28f846640938f9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8eae2da4169298b06e877f603551980, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb9a2988f3f1228bb7fe369b335605ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c46cd1b31299c519a905c5887ba42c9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c64620ebad216eeb0cea93bc61f45304, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caab78268fd069d1064f5ec6c042bb9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd817b5c446c407afeda8d0564375762, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0de4ceefaebfb52ca11748540238375, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d449fbb4aeeab23356a31f91600c675f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd2c9690411f2af152c1fda5160c7038, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e08d3affbc3a4c6da59effb953ff452d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7e0a5d548ee0463022b26ef106d211c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2d1e8deb235b23ff2f2d93fb1f25fe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f40d93a60224fe6e5dfdec4dbd97b5ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa333c8aac0a4340b6f937f6ce05a6d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc3cc585d4611f00d2b17953761178c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fef82bede46a0c3a0e477ccf80d4d165"

In this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a dichotomy in expression of enzyme activity along the jejunal villuscrypt unit. Sectioning of the villus-crypt unit in a cryostat enabled direct comparison of the distribution of lactase and sucrase enzyme activities in the adult rat. There is a stepwise increase in mean lactase/sucrase ratio going from crypt to villus. The data indicate that unlike sucrase activity, which is expressed maximally in enterocytes along the entire villus, maximal lactase activity is not attained until midvillus. The delay in expression of maximal lactase activity might help to explain the vulnerability of this enzyme to acute mucosal insult such as occurs in viral gastroenteritis.",""

Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1- and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K B =(1.1±0.3)×105 M−1). This finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that T20, already approved for clinical application in AIDS treatment, could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/109bcd1038f0c37955a0a4cec6d7402a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/165797df880e5506dd41e9345d948b58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d7f3ad1056b09332a6de6140cc6af64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21655345136e20c983beb08a5d308291, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a7b9b35bb69cdca33f2aa3c2dc50e94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a8a2375053567082d9dab39680a1518, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39f96794b716aed05c87f0450716ac8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bbda58efa01705990828ed925bf7f6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c17570c8a8e6b3b017e7f64754fc0c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4299644bc5204da695ad1728e88e9329, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/576d018f9a6bc948f13bc20885564bf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59c660cdf0355830dcd71af958db771e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/659475448d01a09872b49585440260ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bd073c84f2f48ab9d02e79d2993945d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/727c36e589bcc23602dd8c6c2b8dca9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73ffebc6dd65e8d8136d623bce627272, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/783c663ba9bdc6b1782acd076223d98d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c2fb43ca1eb450a68ce7d7b3cab97b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/854601b310fa690b3fc7f38d17272af1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d8f8a2b2b647f0c5f22ee435700b2ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f55f601f3f3051a974d386b9bbd12a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/981762ceffab55515d33f908b1362742, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d5c0197c276bed1f2f7e202a0d02ef9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa6914b2c8e91d443dbd24fe261f52a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6c9ed4c1811a7f4acc556a144c772af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bab26101004bdd14b279e1ae09a81626, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1a691d5901f3013b0f1fdf5a6813967, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4f967eb0d8aad7ae0a770922b8c3286, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c96ebbea564c92d45764f183f399ff05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6ed09dfcdb17b7979d352663c0fee5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db6a79834da7f76ddf8c40ce57e37f4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd5e7a73208c3a2d95f0a6ed6e7531cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de128f5da69ccdbe2a9c676fa5f4f258, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f68bee98276b2d449e3a8914cb0c1b16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc11d0ea5cc18ed4cd5c9763dee86030"

This has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the naïve, immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced during pregnancy, via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, is critical for piglet protection. However, the anti-PEDV immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis is undefined. We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets. To understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to PEDV, three groups of gilts were orally infected with PEDV in the first, second or third trimester. Control (mock) gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3–5 days postpartum. PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including cytokines, B cells, PEDV antibodies (Abs), and PEDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs and ASCs and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs post PEDV infection. Coinciding with the significantly higher PEDV Ab responses in second trimester gilts, the survival rate of their PEDV-challenged piglets was 100%, compared with 87.2, 55.9, and 5.7% for first, third, and mock litters, respectively. Additionally, piglet survival positively correlated with PEDV IgA Abs and ASCs and VN Abs in milk and PEDV IgA and IgG Abs in piglet serum. Our findings have implications for gestational timing of oral attenuated PEDV maternal vaccines, whereby PEDV intestinal infection in the second trimester optimally stimulated the gut-MG-sIgA axis resulting in 100% lactogenic immune protection in suckling piglets.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01c08c2ccf80ddc2c2d35868ba788115, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02800f697467de3161952efd47b9dd34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e5213d125adcae7d448c3bd47d99f21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/102eb23795ed804e3618ed18f01e2b01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10355dc07e817e2b7580909511742a17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18779e22dde044a1d676dab913f83aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19b3ff7ce4d64d272271189add05712f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21ba8599867d775c0ef5250112a31b50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24d7097d3b485c4a58f8b0254a1f1937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d347c70d6360936d6126f1bedc6955e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fa689656d432da021551c14ed8404f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/341e4503b13b831f2a268a1a06c98474, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/421afc255b7e299b0190693dde1b5ff6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a204644c9fe23d09c53dab30d55064d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e499ecda49b44003541f92bf2ec8499, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f08f6e56e3308f1e64fd21f50c0769e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/523fac33a8452fff84e3660ce4e9e5f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52621e401c4301d9e5dbf21a8ab035b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52b44c66159f278d35d6f737e038255c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5721f92ed2225a3b66b065eb8af0dd85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/583da1587f674a9beb8a1b1caed81b0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bd75833101effe8dbde3788a411dfda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/670907a31257c3b6c54a7005c25a978c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dc2f4e91e03444260b90b5c10a17411, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ee1081921c2adc070d6ce909232d802, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83c0f4fa5831ab01daffeff6574e7bb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8516741d6693e91ca705e05da1ebc75a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85b7cebc009e779b8c1a6a836daffc86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dc4787e0cf46cd4e9dea7ae5cc89ec2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913e09adc45c793710adca5d0a91ded8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95480fab21af7705bb7898255c8a10d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ac7de8c296e805d829798e2157ad8ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bae0de320a5e947dc286ba33e87bb99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d341cf033e1768441a413e9ad4869f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9e62f0d753cd521278d64e3733d5390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b104ce34aad018f2f21cd6cb7123b97f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b118e57a5e7d1badb37aba457a3658d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2322c085faf8c78208d76d521d1648d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3fda33aef1f52cfdbcf45d6be0abdad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b689341642d8b3a7666ff8cfd3c227fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b74264a9d22697275c39aa00d6f9fcd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c05b5d9cf1efbeeac1fe645a8ada316a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0e8e0f5e8fff433ec686db94c0d2c53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c977d2a2db187c1174b89304f5c197c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c999ac5359071eda0987100ee41cc8cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cac63dc831c424c483d060540c8ba342, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd5249aeea7fa51a49e1c5097a89b471, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce4d36da108a633c32b5877826ecfe00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfb75c25715130a0ba7c836d6ceca575, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d109f2b67d473e73b92fe3dcadb2a649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d80ba31def5b04aa44cd11c28f6f0527, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df6948ee9f9cddb91e6309232efb3f7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e315b83654ef4b6d59f1934655e7c3de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eab103926538f6b20ca7642c6219f1cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec20ccb0cc4af021bd04aa922a38a872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed7b1aa336416c9f6db3068508dc54a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f27cafcf1989090906028588945a7e34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f48031b10a841f4eaf7ec6e78507bbd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6166cb8ad39453f22aa88aa4ea49d22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6a1af1263064762021d8038a985756c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc649ec36a668792e4d0764a7e2e5afe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd3856918c3d61b32291dfe786695595"

The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network.

The nasal decongestant oxymetazoline (OMZ) exhibits anti-oxidative and antiinflammatory properties (I. Beck-Speier et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2006;316:842–851). In a follow up study, we hypothesized that OMZ generates pro-resolving lipoxins being paralleled by production of immune-modulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and anti-inflammatory 15(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid [15(S)-HETE] and depletion of pro-inflammatory leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Human neutrophils (PMN) were chosen as the cellular system. The effect of OMZ on these parameters as well as on respiratory burst activity and oxidative stress marker 8-isprostane was analyzed in unstimulated and co-stimulated PMN by ultrafine carbon particles (UCP) or opsonized zymosan (OZ), respectively. In unstimulated cells, OMZ induced formation of PGE2, 15(S)-HETE, and LXA4. The levels of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane were not affected, whereas respiratory burst activity was drastically inhibited. In UCP- and OZ-stimulated control cells, all parameters were elevated. Here, OMZ maintained the increased levels of PGE2, 15(S)-HETE, and LXA4, but substantially suppressed levels of LTB4 and 8-isoprostane and inhibited the respiratory burst activity. These findings suggest a switch from the pro-inflammatory eicosanoid class LTB4 to the pro-resolving LXA4. Since LXA4 is most relevant in returning inflamed tissue to homeostasis, OMZ is postulated to terminate rhinitis-related inflammation, thus contributing to shortening of disease duration.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07fad106e2b18e884dc166290b7d751b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d0327d514ab10294f94e977c37ea4c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11deef5fcc601c009a2875ebd51b3dfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17387f93b46453348a5b883a620eadf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aec4664ded23c3a9c606cccdec4e582, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2473474f06a4290ad7514f3b87b0a839, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27382deeb9cfbde5e3bf430ec186bfaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d295c26c63a24f7bdeef5e462c93e91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35e8159883cf79c12eb6d3a6624b347c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36bcc609e4446ee2a00177dd17811b1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3955017030389756db1db230be6c80b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b7a1e052631077dafb8196e32c33028, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c0b16027b933c3071285ec66c736db5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40aeb983cdb112db8e2ac59f2d830400, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/516518f51624ed35b703a476384b3672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5902559b9ef40fd23aecdc7e14f63809, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61b83e3c0155a2d309534bdd9955b507, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69551b3dedbe13239a46ef61ee0a5931, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/771e7b7f979895fd29d1efe5469c182c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/791766fc8cb10951e2d96709316b2464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9047915439b1eb2ff557e4aa8187f1b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ca043ebd2a0868b0df1a73eb4ee1a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a408bbb151b6451e5226c67ed2cd16e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0c93af1c5a1b9c6f10fe84012201430, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2543495ea4ba887cd79130a12f43802, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd31d95267ed18526a2b9782dc45cc06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c81a1e45b566b2367a386804512cf982, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf4155367a084edc97b67c868ae38fa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3843a70a98fff747584786db7b885f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d419a1391340a6c21ab71e38c9ffde28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3c75ce980959331967ec99d68d3ac64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e77ecec4c1cb5689ae89413bf00f5276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9e9baa8d5cf301df56c31fa20c8e273, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea879998973f7eeec5f027fff9fb8bd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec1b34719c85dee7ddd20f8087d105dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f00b885b1f0722d8aef6b7024c972bef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f57aec6b240f96aaf4e2a63e2885631d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9417f1fbf1edf2bfd46b12bd09c8561"

METHODS: Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim. RESULTS: Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe–host interactions, the term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease.",""

Airborne diseases may spread rapidly as people visit different indoor environments and are in frequent contact with others. We constructed a simple indoor contact model for an ideal city with 7 million people and 3 million indoor spaces, and estimated the probability and duration of contact between any two individuals during one day. To do this, we used data from actual censuses, social behavior surveys, building surveys, and ventilation measurements in Hong Kong to define eight population groups and seven indoor location groups. Our indoor contact model was integrated with an existing epidemiological Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) model to estimate disease spread and with the Wells-Riley equation to calculate local infection risks, resulting in an integrated indoor transmission network model. This model was used to estimate the probability of an infected individual infecting others in the city and to study the disease transmission dynamics. We predicted the infection probability of each sub-population under different ventilation systems in each location type in the case of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak, which is assumed to have the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox. We compared the effectiveness of controlling ventilation in each location type with other intervention strategies. We conclude that increasing building ventilation rates using methods such as natural ventilation in classrooms, offices, and homes is a relatively effective strategy for airborne diseases in a large city.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ad4622a135ef2bf604e2b983e9586e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ba17cd5943ce2f765d0cef28ed42fd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11391824e7f58f4aeb3b3ed801dde53f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ee0846130899d5e312c167e16fcae0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/449132b56326900e9b558d1811b7417c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4eb83b87873384789ca215fc1adbb2e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ef213da2120d5bf5468eaeca9bb25ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52564ff2843990d725ae2c9517b96b7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5326e46572c434ee4627cc29cbfecb35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913c70a7d19e6380a4b5a3fcc5a44dd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a5ba6128aa64beae40307d50ed0be8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9ac6458d01b45947793d280711fd175, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c729a58fc6164926be49523e52be83b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c832de43ad2cc94882158bea8856f322, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb518a1b214bd5d9e9987813917b0694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd85205307837db6148294daafd9a4eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea3f75c59e5c57dc512732603d59c7fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbc60b700e53ddb37d11fb2b0e9b57be"

Codon usage bias analysis can reveal much about the molecular evolution and host adaption of ZIKV. To gain insight into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the codon usage pattern in 46 ZIKV strains by calculating the effective number of codons (ENc), codon adaptation index (CAI), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The results from a correspondence analysis (CA) indicate that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between ZIKV and its hosts suggest that ZIKV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from Homo sapiens on the ZIKV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Taken together, both natural translational selection and mutation pressure are important for shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of ZIKV and its adaption to its hosts.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/018f91843822318036274e9699ecd5b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07a21f6a52d9eaa8f656ff6d988616da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08445f021f627ef858e1d7fb04b5e823, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/091655766752d8053578c5c301295d6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/095c232018162b2e728862236f1db54f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a5857f5a0b67aaedd9af2099608d79c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1002ceab950d2d0b1859f706d0dd3c75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/132f7454d988f7f16aeaa644ba87884a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18cd6a74b2e000d7c02b97fc164f3887, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1acc1fc1e2443f7462abcfeb1b205229, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/293da4db59117229602f699de3b2668f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30ae149bd980718d308e3fcb675f101e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3752015093214c6251295882aeb89268, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/385fa23b88a04e65a34b498ec330a9b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ba90c55f2ceeebe6d2022a38fb30027, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c95a794cd0f2adb024bc0966f95f9d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b00cd68b5e56410ae5e0f9240e91b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e06af2ea3659fc7d2c0e57b8255e976, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5acc25a95aefb1088b104f9f24d56316, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cfe445befe48e3f5fab91741d31bdba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6096d232b68aa69572cfae04dbec1a1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61540b330f5d26a3b020a48ac404cb7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/648e70affc8a579e581b7fdd280447ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69475909c893f52ce58629aed4d93a42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bc934c12b846c6a70deeab7deb4ebe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fd044637e98f65d3a1cebe189ef6995, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75e96390f1acd116ffa5729f240ea489, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84f12f9df3ff9f258c7021afeb5014e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/887f076ef5bd814dcec61d9601a43745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b9bc5d6fe33363e61e7613e3609efe0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c2407a2cd7bcc0b7dce58e7c24c640, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf624a8d96620faaf5c6a94d9fcc884d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0b923cbe902c41bc2a7170cca90da21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d001d896f4541e5ab3c80d7521ce48da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9a826537544b7480f1ce9e2ea589b69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9c6494b05bf99f814e3c44b8d59fbfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea60f508a9acec2976a99a895e130deb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec76af2f11e73deecb3cd20b7c260dd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed485891cfb442d35776f25f2896f619, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f09edea0fbcf3fd2a7c69775352918f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4d95896f83d3b959e6f40b56fdc3afe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8cf39929b7469da942d757049eac285, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd9053e9c3bbc23c715ae4ee5b328547"

Desmethylicaritin is a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids in serum. As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition. This study was designed to investigate the effect of desmethylicaritin on adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine was used to test the clonal expansion. Further, the mRNA level and protein expression of adipgenic and related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear location of β-catenin was identified using immunofluoresence assay. Our results showed that desmethylicaritin suppressed the adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, desmethylicaritin inhibited clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Desmethylicaritin did not affect CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ and β mRNA expression, but decreased the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, adipocyte lipid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b that was however down-regulated after adipogenic induction. Desmethylicaritin increased the protein expression of β-catenin both in the cytoplasm and nuclei and immunofluorescence results confirmed that desmethylicaritin increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Above findings implied that desmethylicaritin was able to inhibit adipogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was regulated by desmethylicaritin in the process of suppression of adipogenesis. Above findings supported desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent for potential prevention of disorders involving lipid metabolism.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/038dd634a1bf7feb243298b226cfc002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08b0c2a9f574e430afe907625b0695fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dbac0afaa004023234747617b93b2af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14e5307ea17bc9b638c4115f2a9c121b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1851625a24a7b4fbcd44c3b2fd0f0c82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b2696a14e980c94cef928dfc97ae827, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c8613d296c775eb2a6a9d19781757c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ef12085da2ad2e57e3f9f05f4ec9b58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2289c255b24e8b454f62bbf79b5a1d55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2709e5c1eba86626f510b8c5af1779e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b0f029ffa690093aebae922d129bafb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3293b71c8c0c3b9209102e4d68b9df02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e0d39336f107b01dd1f04c84509ea67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1f1823a4d4773b0dd1dc9c6392a14b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f91d6235a8b52bff4a72a826cffdc88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/454fee431d6c27400bb6f00309991d7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b1926c82600dbe4806f8b514ac12235, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bce871bd2aa1aa828bd00882e3c76ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ee166d6d3d89859cc71d13cdc31baa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fad93c5ee8b478a4e297db9b83fa876, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/542c9dd6db99ef66621b7981a2826137, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/584eeef47cbeaba4e3b262432e988dbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/598c425ec4517dee7d29d12c431e6d6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/620fe6af92e853850d59e33a714bc4e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6352f445511b3c66c8bfb9c721b1633a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65e4785a306abc0f22f7a3ad25134c67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/660a1fcf6199cb815e191949ddbdb7ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66f26aa0af0a2017e35337277370f36b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/708f57b38831ba216b3e9a27e3053879, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7618bd49f35dddc020f8b46c4a874a22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/774a57b80e2fd76b3ebb7743f930bc00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8265db55f8e8b5e2e2b4337b98c78949, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d130aa0f4bc8fc8fa5b88bb7650f378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f1d7621d4e723a59edeabd0530c74f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a95e62632d66fc1d51f73d8f0fbeddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd44c0a5dc2ed7d366c17cbc419a3eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a29251b4b0060559720fc1b1d3fe2018, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c7ba60165d931e000c03b49ef1f183, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab686dac758c960f0179e919dec99a4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac72e648d39eedb5502283e4c03ad695, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af3433ffd15c535cc978856d4b890678, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b02c82c8017b777a6882d7ce4e05215a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c47d621547fcab416b551e0a2d9a8e04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbb8c9bf279f46e849c0449cd2e288eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d05833c178a4551dc1bf06d1f07823fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2eda40d5f028ef07c46c91697c0d770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d80c9f6babb63d86078be668867f2b6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d87f90a623860c94084be03d71571e91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9311680e65e5d7cf5330e7671a1240c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db929b1f35eb3faf0a3da6be999f06e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de79c6df5be26634fc174aef5c96fcd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e12ef726742bdcca0818c43549b70a87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e15f97e7d82c3895eded8cf3dbba2205, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e602b59d4a12073c00573569a2cb3532, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea5e546ad7108bff9ec1e19ffb87013a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed6ea7245afe46d1109b0e80e4c032be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eecb7001b9ba3374c79b275bf83f3fdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f353661014f9fef2138a591fdf883ed2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4244698e959150c0fd9197a1bf51c72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f63b5da5264105b4e509ee45a9a7f1c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8cc3c9d9ebe09e25baf764df1ff4221, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f1972df8b8fd015824c6f3cd2a7a3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdb3e0dfd033ebf08da1a3bb535802a0"

Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04b41f459c45afa09d628cc425c5403b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0940590dc1d0fce274d585ab4f413f21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fdef151e6cef45b8d689fa1655d3cef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/235031e38357eed42ac149f717ac5d1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36bec6b246721eada662c59697840dee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3876202a641d8e2a99f9dddd16f725fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f58004e54bb5237fd23ea35dac5c1ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58cb10a5855728dd3c3268f4e5372a5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5af1147b1fd526b545dabcf3ffaa0cee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f204f7c310cbedc3ad2ad5e0d1c8f57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/766fec64350a9ff46ffdcd253afbac65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83e49bb71aca1206ca70a0848ccdef54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85fbc94692ca672a7cbc25452ab21d45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cb7206def72bf7bad65e1b86fa9c6bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90f13086085e8e6a1850cfee3456d240, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/966549c07acde173c91cedfeb84ce74f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99d3f7d8447f2e96020a237a2b580c9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4da2b8413a588a27f92e4da2624ed9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5444cf2d65ef423de4a66e9193aa420, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba123b9ead988b9ab9ed65264ceccef9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be9153189b017d3045a28dba6f36ba5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c658b352edce72e5b50b47b3eaf56d2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c80383598d5aa912e927f3780ce8ba56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da3a9037f6eb1cc06215c2b3c86ba6aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbf919aee990a913184afef3824dd12b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd4dd5f30c36db5b4ad51729258a2ef8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3c18e3b227af182b4e0e800233a5ca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e94bfbe51918cf117ff86b9f9479bb97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eea5c0e778e10c28faed7c8e3c31f97c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8d74896ac90afb06a9a19e5b3d6519e"

The two genotypes most frequently found in the lesions are HPV-16 and HPV-18 with a prevalence of 50–60% and 15–18%, respectively. The E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins are involved in the transformation process and represent foreign antigens for the host. We previously reported that anti-HPV-18 E6 CD4(+) T cells are present in patients with high-grade HPV-18-expressing cervical lesions but also in 50% of the total consecutive patients tested, independently of the HPV type carried. These results indicated that HPV-18 E6 is immunogenic and suggested that all responsive patients, irrespective of the HPV expressed, had encountered HPV-18 and cleared the infection. Here, we investigated anti-HPV-18 E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in a cohort of 23 HPV-18 E6-responsive patients. We found that, although E7-specific CD4(+) T cells were present in all women, a robust T helper type (Th1)/Th2 type response against E7 was associated with HPV-18-negative status, suggesting that indeed these patients might have cleared the virus. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found strong anti-E7 CD4(+) T-cell immunity in 20% of 24 healthy donors without evidence of disease. In contrast, a robust Th1/Th2 type response against E6 but not E7 correlated with a lack of disease relapse and/or infection recurrence but did not discriminate between HPV-18-positive and HPV-18-negative patients. Collectively, our data suggest different roles for anti-HPV-18 E6 and E7 CD4(+) T cells in anti-viral and anti-tumour immunity.",""

Nevertheless, we hypothesized that recombinant viruses could be analyzed as sexually reproducing organisms, using either a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach or a locus-by-locus fixation index (F ST). Locus-by-locus F ST analysis, and four different regressions and interval mapping algorithms of QTL analysis were applied to a phenotypic and genotypic dataset previously obtained from 47 artificial recombinant genomes generated between two begomovirus species. Both approaches assigned the determinant of within-host accumulation—previously identified using standard virology approaches—to a region including the 5׳ end of the replication-associated protein (Rep) gene and the upstream intergenic region. This study provides a proof of principle that QTL and population genetics tools can be extended to characterize the genetic determinants of viral traits.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/113461ef6cae8c69d720c1ab390a4b4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f219c1fbec221ef9be619e21adae0e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20f6455b8de18e75b8e7186094bca41a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24691d79e2d9a596ba1ffbe40b25f1a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2909887c580623e8b3a2ed3ab2ceb1e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3294e4b1300bd40aa616ea14770b1049, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/336b6a61ccc7b27bb835539207bcff1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/342f92583467e9f8065a89370d3acb7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4810224fdf0947c01190aff13a9ba3fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50a2efad225980424bcbeb6c8933dcdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55696a57906e97cbf35309027aa2b804, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dd419447e817bb943a2267cadf83eb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b92b0136a9f320d8b413af7f7749ec5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e672de00dbe66e86525633a3e5ebba4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81e9d032ff8f376f796894ce867bbb50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82a6f52fb2db02eb9846552b03ad9a36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86921c04441f5ea1a5d1842f23bd5224, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c04cf77bd6803e181baaff260cb2807, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c916e2205d33d12df4e6c28edb03796, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a423361bf79469939f68a85268257861, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae26b95afadf5d06e628ba6ad820bb94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bda380ba63dc80d3f091f07e6e5232b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4d05c74c1650efc71972810aa7c65d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e24846f890ce2ce2fb3a4d9b8d664e6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3619811976ef1d1c1384e0a1bb5adba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f10f0a3afb69d6714670c63f271e8db1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f21792ce68c6028bd074aa1469e5cafb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f381f1e2d13b96d04bb291ad94c9b6fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f505ad9bcb6b633f1ab8e692d9c771b4"

Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host–pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called ‘multitask learning’, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A ‘task’ in our scenario is the set of host–pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host–pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex–Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host–pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.

Objective To examine whether three ways of visually presenting data (heat map, dot map, or picto-trendline)—all depicting the same information regarding the spread of a hypothetical outbreak of influenza—influence intent to vaccinate, risk perception, and knowledge. Design Survey with participants randomized to receive a simulated news article accompanied by one of the three graphics that communicated prevalence of influenza and number of influenza-related deaths. Setting International online survey. Participants 16,510 adults living in 11 countries selected using stratified random sampling based on age and gender. Measurements After reading the article and viewing the presented graphic, participants completed a survey that measured interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, knowledge gained, interest in additional information about the disease, and perception of the graphic. Results Heat maps and picto-trendlines were evaluated more positively than dot maps. Heat maps were more effective than picto-trendlines and no different from dot maps at increasing interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, and interest in additional information about the disease. Heat maps and picto-trendlines were more successful at conveying knowledge than dot maps. Overall, heat maps were the only graphic to be superior in every outcome. Limitations Results are based on a hypothetical scenario. Conclusion Heat maps are a viable option to promote interest in and concern about infectious diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4513786dcbaf8384a59d902e74a227c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/763af2cba26642b66788d0d464db3caf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81870132b9f3f170a8443d796b07a026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9319b0c1562cd94ff07373bb0417956c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0651be42e373f5e6c365fc0e1b4b60b"

We hypothesized that EMR-based surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past. METHODS: We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. Backgrounds of daily case counts were either synthesized or obtained by applying one of three previously validated ARI case-detection algorithms to authentic EMR entries. From the time of outbreak injection, detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection and background-only time series. The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background+injection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2–4 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling). RESULTS: In otherwise identical surveillance systems, SARIMA detected epidemics sooner than EARS at any FAR below 10%. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility and marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling. Under plausible real-world conditions, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by 5–16 days. It also was more sensitive at detecting the summer wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic. CONCLUSION: Time series modeling of long-term historical EMR data can reduce the time it takes to discover epidemics of ARI. Realistic surveillance simulations may prove invaluable to optimize system design and tuning.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/047417f4a2876ff08b7247d594cc9240, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19dfd64f92321195e4391ecff66b9d01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d6c01bad43137864325600d7555ff72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/992b71ebccb1045a440188c88eb1ec7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d128327ecec98be8d53931a63a5c0ab4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2ee9879f036b7e06b3098d2a0576356, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e419f98b631d5f837249a68ad1ce1747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef01e58540c74ac7697100d427fc3fd3"

Porcine rubulavirus (PoRV) was identified as the aetiological agent of disease outbreaks in pigs in Mexico during early 1980s, but the origin of PoRV remains elusive. In this study, the completed genome sequence of MPRV was determined, and the complete genome sequence of PoRV was assembled from previously published protein-coding genes and the non-coding genome regions determined from this study. Comparison of sequence and genome organization indicated that PoRV is more closely related to MPRV than to any other members of the genus Rubulavirus. In the P gene coding region of both viruses, there is an ORF located at the 5′ end of the P gene overlapping with the P protein coding region, similar to the C protein ORF present in most viruses of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, but absent in other known rubulaviruses. Based on these findings, we hypothesise that PoRV may also originate from bats, and spillover events from bats to pigs, either directly or via an intermediate host, were responsible for the sporadic disease outbreaks observed in Mexico.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00f3eab41a372f1ff98d8b4ebf799d4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25e8bdb561ed049a0ac7d75a5ee1840e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30c8e83b66ec88b537aefb12c58048e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d43697f0370b3cd14dc02aaa6eca35c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f8c4843e0ca6b24a7c6b3e3f1a76b78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/485a6576a159f6b090bd24a6ff034c9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c481342c811c5797878b330c8c48585, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55c0df319b243377c91ee2e16e3d01e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b2ce14a7719fc673439d618cb643c73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60d502465be1701ba75798860b8e868c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65ce9d510602b7cb05d0109e89945de5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86eab17687808db171cb354747ca62ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/871a68758f78070a217f1846473510cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93939a58d124324286403db738e82bec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/969963663b876124a688df22f465f3b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9db2423a61a3e1b0712a337f2bbbb0ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afdfd416892c493bc94cd1aea14861e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1becde1d9756e375977d4f5ddac3c8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc301be7f2ca431d880749e2c8e97b2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcf81c89e01aeb0043ad9083cec1be9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0467eafaae5b011c37cbc2cc41fea2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0e4530fd471fed29d127c697935eceb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1b358fda87e9d4692bbf29208222ef1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2142405f73de92ca7da12af66ee0cfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e047a4a0abca520cd91d476848af69ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8606cb0612b1af4e5e033108d37bb2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec5fc0493ded645f0d7e2404a2787bd5"

In response to environmental cues, the BvgAS regulatory system controls expression of a spectrum of phenotypic phases, transitioning between a virulent (Bvg(+)) phase and a nonvirulent (Bvg(−)) phase, a process referred to as phenotypic modulation. We hypothesized that the ability of Bordetella bronchiseptica to undergo phenotypic modulation is required at one or more points during the infectious cycle in swine. To investigate the Bvg phase-dependent contribution to pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we constructed a series of isogenic mutants in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate and compared each mutant to the wild-type isolate for its ability to colonize and cause disease. We additionally tested whether a BvgAS system capable of modulation is required for direct or indirect transmission. The Bvg(−) phase-locked mutant was never recovered from any respiratory tract site at any time point examined. An intermediate phase-locked mutant (Bvg(i)) was found in numbers lower than the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, colonization of the respiratory tract and disease caused by the Bvg(+) phase-locked mutant and the wild-type strain were indistinguishable. The Bvg(+) phase-locked mutant transmitted to naïve pigs by both direct and indirect contact with efficiency equal to that of the wild-type isolate. These results indicate that while full activation of the BvgAS regulatory system is required for colonization and severe disease, it is not deleterious to direct and indirect transmission. Overall, our results demonstrate that the Bvg(+) phase is sufficient for respiratory infection and host-to-host transmission of B. bronchiseptica in swine.",""

Viral genetic determinants specifically associated with FIPV pathogenesis have not yet been discovered. Viral gene signatures in the spike, non-structural protein 3c, and membrane of the coronavirus genome have been shown to often correlate with disease manifestation. An “in vivo mutation transition hypothesis” is widely accepted and postulates that de novo virus mutation occurs in vivo giving rise to virulence. The existence of “distinct circulating avirulent and virulent strains” is an alternative hypothesis of viral pathogenesis. It may be possible that viral dynamics from both hypotheses are at play in the occurrence of FIP. Epidemiologic data suggests that the genetic background of the cat contributes to the manifestation of FIP. Further studies exploring both viral and host genetic determinants of disease in FIP offer specific opportunities for the management of this disease.",""

Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene–induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a “compensation” for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1937","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03f2de68739498b3375a34ffc18e2b77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07a7de1f7164d8fa9b6331284aea90a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bc6be4075d1a0790ce97068b41efbc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/173e41836cfab2424ae36d6c1c9245d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1995a1abf0d9bc551e2ee7685fcfacab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f9c868c04f381662db0885bc98c8a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b4a6caa9435227747541ef3f7197dd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ce901e46609ea9491c573938a2828b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3414803382c81864e91e6fa52d69110f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35db8129bd24739d4c8614e4b9f48267, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bcc5730f6ebf13c476da892064e9333, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d2f3b97aee5078f5fdb28bfef3c8452, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3df1b4f43bf2cc9ac6f9c5003eb02a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40160ace872393a3e68bf571ebbf35f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40907b0805d0193ae732c3a1b02c1986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f5a75ec36290ff5facbc037ce6533b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5375b0dc5b8f72a5f92f4a93c856d793, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c8e3e9e99de7e6bffaa0414001ac96c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d40c24be08ce8261add1de3bf9ccfa0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d44107b1babef0bd4c3ec8405d32426, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f0c03914fd1b65ef23cfb05053f220d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6369b7c3210918714761487d08e44271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/696feaf4aaaab4dea20d1388a33fade8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a7305bf7d47d89e83024b0c949c859, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bf8c78e7e6fa381b31fc89312bdcfb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d44b73331ed6f041e280bd463b3e0a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d8842369794fa57cc22de21f328f172, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8658f14e9767269d98285910239ee142, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/893e53f1062b649fef4f12ff1164abf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8aab6f01f71387fdc10cc260ce9569bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b680b38e1a731ee35bc87de7ae2b6a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c7d1d7e6ffdb3ef330597f87d24645d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d6e8970607b3afa980f8dd97eb0e2da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95c0a06113d77ca962feacc49e6de35d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97f0180add13312b54367483efd887d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae157a56ae7314adcc8eb943651c4492, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae40212a46ea59bb77d2339cf22d56ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af3e6faf6232727d013797c204adc2bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af990d56e147e6f08e6a297a70956318, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afe00738c415c3789ac4d68f55e3f23e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6d096f9a039bec900db343fde1ab873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd8e6a7c7d861493d138edea408dfb8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bef43b100b521e39c3b9dadc19a4ae28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce1eb4e492af70179fd9ef4dec0ffce8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d39a824ed6bd4c29a78ecebbb629d2a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4b14d54e8662d5a5c40ed5c42dafde8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfae50624699d840853e0eebdc30a4cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e002fbe6764a58c91f1e0f4eebcb24a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4e2befeb4647c4409f517c1f2a7b961, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8f3225d4739dbd83f4fb36b2d326e12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f432ff4ecaf197969f3b234732f342c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6fc852cabb5f7032fbc15b150cee892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d55e76f55854c250526133441c7885"

Beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen. One of the important virulence characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 is the eaeA gene encoding the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. Intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. RESULTS: Cattle were orally inoculated with either milk (control), milk with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (vector), or milk with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin (vaccinated) on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 98, all calves were challenged orally with E. coli O157:H7 to evaluate whether vaccination with the recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin would reduce the level of E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding. During the first 28 days, vaccinated calves shed both the vector strain and the intimin-expressing S. Dublin strain at a similar level. The vector strain was shed for a significantly longer period as compared to the level of recombinant vaccine strain. Calves that received the intimin-expressed vaccine ceased shedding S. Dublin from day 28 to day 63. All calves were challenged with E. coli O157:H7 on day 98 to determine the effect on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. The amount of E. coli O157:H7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge. We observed a transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the feces in the vaccinated calves. The magnitude of fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal IgA. CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin reduced enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. However, the transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 was not associated with an enhanced IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0783d74811cf14f00cfbf14bc7549c3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c05b62241af698cfaffbb6196aff5e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0df094ca52e162612673b4a277f644f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eee1f4a14b37d555c2d87d4034f1c79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/129ce21f9d80ec91ea7dc4d23a4ba276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19ba775567335a87c81a64e8c6f1dbef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e2164c02ba04dcc5e4d5ac464f5b1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/252b2464cdd480b802c32282958f4e27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/293d6602a6bfd03f8212bb915f68033c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38993441594313e573f2753854cba4ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/456d52819c611fd65d58751f2708a98c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/457eb855d5287c2554694d87c7e2c494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51d54ef50d7cce5dbf910cf6ff9503ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/544393e61998dfd92b787541e5af66b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67b4b0e9d182b7b8298533b8e4c97671, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/698d151db96f6925bc6109d9beb8c159, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e386ac8704676ae6edc8bb8631b43a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d2596c3298cb0ea04aa7eecc349c59c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/860dd7b1275f511cce804080a06b9a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3345b89db142d65b8814136304758df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a566ea96e2927fb8edeb819d316e7782, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9917b64d6a52d11857291eb419e0bfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab0085c455423dba18101a40692f56c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aef631c23ff37bd52da360011625e9c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b552987cf83f3b2552428bfac3332486, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc972693d192500e8d9461d113c30baa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8b00056c7e97fd190a5d08f5b436443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca1a70679b16df98ad5c62e485f714a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd8b1c108c9ad2e02ea8fe9671ce7cc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4197f31e55d3030e529ed29c4d64c22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6a9bf22fb6ead8407715c9f613ccb1f"

The function remains obscure and a scattered taxonomical distribution has been reported by numerous groups. METHODS: We have searched GenBank in order to identify all viral accessions that have s2m(−like) sequence motifs. Rigorous phylogenetic analyses and constrained tree topology testing were also performed in order to investigate the apparently mobile nature of s2m. RESULTS: The stem-loop s2m structure can be found in four families of + ssRNA viruses; Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae. In all of these virus families, with the possible exception of Caliciviridae, multiple gains and/or losses of s2m would have to be postulated in order to explain the distribution of this character. CONCLUSIONS: s2m appears to be a mobile genetic element with a unique evolutionary history in all of the four virus families where it can be found. Based on our findings and a review of the current literature on s2m, a hypothesis implying an RNAi-like function for the s2m element is also outlined.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04f2a6ea24bba0463f1c48cf853568c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16e1e93f50c86764f3cea55721d7cba5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/174af5b5723a79a944d45875fc8baf0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1af399a96d0b56eb280ae8e2838839f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/358fe4aac84bd3cdf1779f6e21614f1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e88460431d8b3719a07f6abcec7b845, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c946fc651d4f97197b9961df9917a03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e5c787d3cf5996353204bc6c77f1dc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71e57c2636b607b5888d56d3ceae75d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8015db7dfef191b141cb1475ab6a02de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/926cd3c729cca5a0fab0bc8a9ecf949d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2fc1b114000236a5c42b78899d9121d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e310923da68989f00388215ce84f5865, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e77214b6e1955f658c0dbc3cd5a50a87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efeb4fde6a17ca07b96b1cabeb733dcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff556034b0d5ce07708ca9de76c685df"

Current chemotherapy for arenavirus infection is limited to the nucleoside analogue ribavirin, which is characterized by considerable toxicity and treatment failure. Using Pichinde virus as a model arenavirus, we attempted to design glycoprotein-derived fusion inhibitors similar to the FDA-approved anti-HIV peptide enfuvirtide. We have identified a GP2-derived peptide, AVP-p, with antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. The 50% inhibitory dose (IC(50)) for the peptide is 7 μM, with complete inhibition of viral plaque formation at approximately 20 μM, and its antiviral activity is largely sequence dependent. AVP-p demonstrates activity against viruses with the Old and New World arenavirus viral glycoprotein complex but not against enveloped viruses of other families. Unexpectedly, fusion assays reveal that the peptide induces virus-liposome fusion at neutral pH and that the process is strictly glycoprotein mediated. As observed in cryo-electron micrographs, AVP-p treatment causes morphological changes consistent with fusion protein activation in virions, including the disappearance of prefusion glycoprotein spikes and increased particle diameters, and fluorescence microscopy shows reduced binding by peptide-treated virus. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements suggest that glycoproteins are destabilized by peptide-induced alterations in viral membrane order. We conclude that untimely deployment of fusion machinery by the peptide could render virions less able to engage in on-pathway receptor binding or endosomal fusion. AVP-p may represent a potent, highly specific, novel therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection. IMPORTANCE Because the only drug available to combat infection by Lassa virus, a highly pathogenic arenavirus, is toxic and prone to treatment failure, we identified a peptide, AVP-p, derived from the fusion glycoprotein of a nonpathogenic model arenavirus, which demonstrates antiviral activity and no acute cytotoxicity. AVP-p is unique among self-derived inhibitory peptides in that it shows broad, specific activity against pseudoviruses bearing Old and New World arenavirus glycoproteins but not against viruses from other families. Further, the peptide's mechanism of action is highly novel. Biochemical assays and cryo-electron microscopy indicate that AVP-p induces premature activation of viral fusion proteins through membrane perturbance. Peptide treatment, however, does not increase the infectivity of cell-bound virus. We hypothesize that prematurely activated virions are less fit for receptor binding and membrane fusion and that AVP-p may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for arenavirus infection.",""

The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease.

Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e. initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g. changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g. costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g. epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.",""

This lectin binds to high mannose carbohydrate structures, including those found on viruses containing glycosylated envelope proteins such as human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Therefore, we hypothesized that BanLec might inhibit HIV-1 through binding of the glycosylated HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120. We determined that BanLec inhibits primary and laboratory-adapted HIV-1 isolates of different tropisms and subtypes. BanLec possesses potent anti-HIV activity, with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar to picomolar range. The mechanism for BanLec-mediated antiviral activity was investigated by determining if this lectin can directly bind the HIV-1 envelope protein and block entry of the virus into the cell. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed direct binding of BanLec to gp120 and indicated that BanLec can recognize the high mannose structures that are recognized by the monoclonal antibody 2G12. Furthermore, BanLec is able to block HIV-1 cellular entry as indicated by temperature-sensitive viral entry studies and by the decreased levels of the strong-stop product of early reverse transcription seen in the presence of BanLec. Thus, our data indicate that BanLec inhibits HIV-1 infection by binding to the glycosylated viral envelope and blocking cellular entry. The relative anti-HIV activity of BanLec compared favorably to other anti-HIV lectins, such as snowdrop lectin and Griffithsin, and to T-20 and maraviroc, two anti-HIV drugs currently in clinical use. Based on these results, BanLec is a potential component for an anti-viral microbicide that could be used to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV-1.",""

Typically, toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. RESULTS: The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all α-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase β-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods, we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains, KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains, such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic, inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life. In prokaryotes HEPN domains are essential components of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) and abortive infection (Abi) systems and in addition are tightly associated with many restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems, and occasionally with other defense systems such as Pgl and Ter. We present evidence of multiple modes of action of HEPN domains in these systems, which include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) in conjunction with other RNase domains (e.g. a novel RNase H fold domain, NamA), suicidal or dormancy-inducing attack on self RNAs (RM systems and possibly CRISPR-Cas systems), and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components (Abi systems). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. We propose that altruistic cell suicide mediated by HEPN domains and other functionally similar RNases was essential for the evolution of kin and group selection and cell cooperation. HEPN domains were repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes and incorporated into several core functions such as endonucleolytic processing of the 5.8S-25S/28S rRNA precursor (Las1), a novel ER membrane-associated RNA degradation system (C6orf70), sensing of unprocessed transcripts at the nuclear periphery (Swt1). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, similar to prokaryotes, HEPN proteins were recruited to antiviral, antitransposon, apoptotic systems or RNA-level response to unfolded proteins (Sacsin and KEN domains) in several groups of eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive sequence and structure comparisons reveal unexpectedly broad presence of the HEPN domain in an enormous variety of defense and stress response systems across the tree of life. In addition, HEPN domains have been recruited to perform essential functions, in particular in eukaryotic rRNA processing. These findings are expected to stimulate experiments that could shed light on diverse cellular processes across the three domains of life.

As they may seriously impact the circulation of certain parasites and the emergence and management of infectious diseases, their study is essential. In the field, detecting parasite interactions is rendered difficult by the fact that a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. To correct for these “false interactions”, methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present paper we propose such a method for presence-absence data (i.e., serology). Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic. The method is termed “the corrected chi-square.” Its robustness was compared to a pre-existing method based on logistic regression and the corrected chi-square proved to be much more robust for small sample sizes. Since the logistic regression approach is easier to implement, we propose as a rule of thumb to use the latter when the ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters is above ten. Applied to serological data for four viruses infecting cats, the approach revealed pairwise interactions between the Feline Herpesvirus, Parvovirus and Calicivirus, whereas the infection by FIV, the feline equivalent of HIV, did not modify the risk of infection by any of these viruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work therefore points out possible interactions that can be further investigated in experimental conditions and, by providing a user-friendly R program and a tutorial example, offers new opportunities for animal and human epidemiologists to detect interactions of interest in the field, a crucial step in the challenge of multiple infections.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a8672459511afa3e4279f20acae9418, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c9c18af3a1c5d3a1ae421a8a5f14460, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/938d1ad8d3f37e8907de14f3132f6e60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/984f7f089721e5b9c4b7107b02d594e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a16b328a1fd7687c1545eaf17d471a44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7af498aca478cc550a70f0dbc12ce95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6f81c3475b0568ee92aed31c35e3d59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e197d8965306215c3fd1a9e6ebf11df0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7ae5a5f80bc36b73b7201fcc004dfd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8f12a089c0c8b6c91eabb7304c61be6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4d4c35dfc2531a78504195bb4b267a7"

The virus takes advantage of the host-RNA-processing machinery to provide the alternative splicing capability necessary for the expression of this proteomic diversity. Serine–arginine-rich (SR) proteins and the kinases that activate them are central to this alternative splicing machinery. In studies reported here, we use the HIV genome as a model. We show that HIV expression decreases overall SR protein/activity. However, we also show that HIV expression is significantly increased (20-fold) when one of the SR proteins, SRp75 is phosphorylated by SR protein kinase (SRPK)2. Thus, inhibitors of SRPK2 and perhaps of functionally related kinases, such as SRPK1, could be useful antiviral agents. Here, we develop this hypothesis and show that HIV expression down-regulates SR proteins in Flp-In293 cells, resulting in only low-level HIV expression in these cells. However, increasing SRPK2 function up-regulates HIV expression. In addition, we introduce SR protein phosphorylation inhibitor 340 (SRPIN340), which preferentially inhibits SRPK1 and SRPK2 and down-regulates SRp75. Although an isonicotinamide compound, SPRIN340 (or its derivatives) remain to be optimized for better specificity and lower cytotoxicity, we show here that SRPIN340 suppresses propagation of Sindbis virus in plaque assay and variably suppresses HIV production. Thus, we show that SRPK, a well known kinase in the cellular RNA-processing machinery, is used by at least some viruses for propagation and hence suggest that SRPIN340 or its derivatives may be useful for curbing viral diseases.",""

The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors, including PPARα, and to a lesser degree PPARβ and PPARγ1. How these transcription factors are regulated in the heart is largely unknown. Recent studies have described post-translational ubiquitination of PPARs as ways in which PPAR activity is inhibited in cancer. However, specific mechanisms in the heart have not previously been described. Recent studies have implicated the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger-2 (MuRF2) in inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor SRF. Initial studies of MuRF2−/− hearts revealed enhanced PPAR activity, leading to the hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR activity by post-translational ubiquitination. METHODS: MuRF2−/− mice were challenged with a 26-week 60% fat diet designed to simulate obesity-mediated insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice were followed by conscious echocardiography, blood glucose, tissue triglyceride, glycogen levels, immunoblot analysis of intracellular signaling, heart and skeletal muscle morphometrics, and PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ1-regulated mRNA expression. RESULTS: MuRF2 protein levels increase ~20% during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet. Compared to littermate wildtype hearts, MuRF2−/− hearts exhibit an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by an early onset systolic dysfunction, larger left ventricular mass, and higher heart weight. MuRF2−/− hearts had significantly increased PPARα- and PPARγ1-regulated gene expression by RT-qPCR, consistent with MuRF2’s regulation of these transcription factors in vivo. Mechanistically, MuRF2 mono-ubiquitinated PPARα and PPARγ1 in vitro, consistent with its non-degradatory role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, increasing MuRF2:PPARγ1 (>5:1) beyond physiological levels drove poly-ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PPARγ1 in vitro, indicating large MuRF2 increases may lead to PPAR degradation if found in other disease states. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in MuRF2 have been described to contribute to the severity of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study suggests that the lack of MuRF2, as found in these patients, can result in an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy. These studies also identify MuRF2 as the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate cardiac PPARα and PPARγ1 activities in vivo via post-translational modification without degradation.

Previously, we showed that SARS-CoV PLpro processes the replicase polyprotein at three conserved cleavage sites. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a 316-amino-acid catalytic core domain of PLpro that can efficiently cleave replicase substrates in trans-cleavage assays and peptide substrates in fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based protease assays. We performed bioinformatics analysis on 16 papain-like protease domains from nine different coronaviruses and identified a putative catalytic triad (Cys1651-His1812-Asp1826) and zinc-binding site. Mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp1826 and the four cysteine residues involved in zinc binding are essential for SARS-CoV PLpro activity. Molecular modeling of SARS-CoV PLpro suggested that this catalytic core may also have deubiquitinating activity. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro by two independent assays. SARS CoV-PLpro hydrolyzed both diubiquitin and ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrates, and hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC is approximately 180-fold more efficient than hydrolysis of a peptide substrate that mimics the PLpro replicase recognition sequence. To investigate the critical determinants recognized by PLpro, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the P6 to P2′ residues at each of the three PLpro cleavage sites. We found that PLpro recognizes the consensus cleavage sequence LXGG, which is also the consensus sequence recognized by cellular deubiquitinating enzymes. This similarity in the substrate recognition sites should be considered during the development of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors.",""

However, a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy. Expansion of cells ex vivo using traditional culture techniques significantly reduces engraftment potential. We hypothesized that activation of Notch signaling during ex vivo expansion would maintain donor cell engraftment potential. In this study, we expanded freshly isolated canine muscle-derived cells on tissue culture plates coated with Delta-1(ext)-IgG to activate Notch signaling or with human IgG as a control. A model of canine-to-murine xenotransplantation was used to quantitatively compare canine muscle cell engraftment, and determine if engrafted donor cells could function as satellite cells in vivo. We show that Delta-1(ext)-IgG inhibited differentiation of canine muscle-derived cells, and increased the level of genes normally expressed in myogenic precursors. Moreover, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG resulted in a significant increase in the number of donor-derived fibers, as compared to cells expanded on human IgG, reaching engraftment levels similar to freshly isolated cells. Importantly, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG engrafted to the recipient satellite cell niche, and contributed to further regeneration. A similar strategy of expanding human muscle-derived cells on Notch ligand might facilitate engraftment and muscle regeneration for patients affected with muscular dystrophy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/040e08253535aa03a86cb74553ead8aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1282ae4b98f694bb156b7fe6cac1ed44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/202e3004075701b5491513891ec5df7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b1b6f79d1b634a2c7094a5ac91c74e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/314f18aae6c89325badee7d6f7cdfd7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ecec3b3cb0a4b080758951042867bc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49d10e4e4ba45281635157e685d5c19c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ba5b95b03cbb1e134700a41bd05a5eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/502126dcc4fe84b0e1240132fb648760, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55325c82abaa6e2d7300e91edc939b6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63f4c58287cc3d61fd395bd22807f7e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/718fc602743c08a3f122dc82c774a5c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f0b9483ff05e478d550517df31dfcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c2d41e1d852470262aa62d80c33b242, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d2d47901b551a6fe3e87679396ac752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e0219df1f89cb1d631d696a24e93971, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ee130381fc30fcbf7e7c292dc4128b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b4438e211d50524543668da91a88c11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f266279ed8481cb8a5ca6bc798dbbc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab215a79a9ca580c7910ba48ede80368, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd61ce21ebed510eada510cbaa7ea4ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c162fd4ede7770c7e6317d9ba9eeb39c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce03d656931b951939a383e99360c5c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d63d405d2fbddfe55f755f4c95afc474, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6b07b2389ebafa141153839d1d851f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df35118201b745837b961c71677c5a19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8ad31051dc2cab3c1c4139e6b442f58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb23b7b746a22047e75144a9833cb21e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed000eb33e9055ecfa87a487d4fa8c06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd303c2030ca5ae8067071ed343d88ee"

Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the −1 frameshift. The stem–loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3–4 bp in the stem–loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04ff3581f1efda2ca60c4d1e7a95172a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ec464de314e810ea7cfa83b7b29eef4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ead67c85649f2cf7e8834a8cf9196d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ecc4baf30f26819daa9d6d0bb65dd97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2177c30e9449e3410137136ae41dc4b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/277913b46e28301369f861cb2e1d9651, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3096c9a77c91ca136eee641c8b5365b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35bd13f08b48e33ffdac52e69aa5a39f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bca80cecd529de140526642b3b973c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c8e1128bd0a5227c0d6b69ccdb6e136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1f2f40c6a921d8c4b92587cb0d0818, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e611cd054d48b788c5dd3dcd1740def, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4521f93a7e5924d0e903274d5597b666, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48056e239a31b7ca4225eca0b9791f4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49b1b5411b6c3ccabb880937db66acd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dcf6df9acd2e04d84e8915dfe5fc1de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/599c8ad4d267af265a3cf22840e4a457, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70846e289e09f307011b3f8f9d2ac551, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72dc2132896f140c40a7d0afd4245682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/740e70114bfae2efb12bc7f5d3e0e514, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c25dce644778d72879b8d6694929da3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97a7e2680ec06c6151cb3ded6f631962, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2ed7cbe7595a8f18e1c8cc1435d515b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad73d5c1e735e66e9e4e616fe5586651, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b779cbf41bb5547473c08529127d6663, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c84832cfbf78009756921b601e07bead, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cce40ee7a0450f8902f4cd98990b8187, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf56155806665602dd4279afc172d71f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9d686155cfefa95b777121e9bc5b9fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db9790f4fd42f32a1c2c863eb18a4b42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e46896e06bdfd62663360a7903e2556a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e87784c273f635cb661c7f20038efb0d"

Together, these findings demonstrate that the relationship between the density of HCVcc and the density of the extracellular milieu can significantly impact the rate at which HCVcc productively interacts with target cells in vitro.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00ee5c6d4fac345355031788bdbbed09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b9ea1a187500a912bff08c2b628ee1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1644c67e197642dbfcf4727626ac0f55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35456d979caa681a58dc80e676c4d37d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/399834b6cf891881824edff68812e95a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e6560699592f2498142b764b9bcbadb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f5eabdbe33530049af50cc6ab0d2ffe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51e4d362b4e4f23bd578c6888d5efbed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77f4db899a940995eeb341f00db776a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e2dfaf117616d7d66152bde8a277df8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88ba84190329873fa8f3c3c40b4fd3bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f4337a6c2b8cb4622b421a5698c971, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0ac985e0d89af569094eb4e5e068248, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2785d68943c988331e4a9d2f0d4287b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3adf1fea26092df154c906b12017630, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7b3200beb89fb66e295dd98b18302a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d89e93f9dbba7a2e81190d55e70fd9a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4c09fd92d3bda7ec64658d5e9ebb8b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e87056775a8a6ba19a817cfe0abc44d1"

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand the safety partnership preferences of patients and their families. METHOD: We used a discrete choice conjoint experiment to model the safety partnership preferences of 1,084 patients or those such as parents acting on their behalf. Participants made choices between hypothetical safety partnerships composed by experimentally varying 15 four-level partnership design attributes. RESULTS: Participants preferred an approach to safety based on partnerships between patients and staff rather than a model delegating responsibility for safety to hospital staff. They valued the opportunity to participate in point of service safety partnerships, such as identity and medication double checks, that might afford an immediate risk reduction. Latent class analysis yielded two segments. Actively engaged participants (73.3%) comprised outpatients with higher education, who anticipated more benefits to safety partnerships, were more confident in their ability to contribute, and were more intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer a personal engagement strategy, valued scientific evidence, preferred a more active approach to safety education, and advocated disclosure of errors. The passively engaged segment (26.7%) anticipated fewer benefits, were less confident in their ability to contribute, and were less intent on participating. They were more likely to prefer an engagement strategy based on signage. They preferred that staff explain why they thought patients should help make care safer and decide whether errors were disclosed. Inpatients, those with immigrant backgrounds, and those with less education were more likely to be in this segment. CONCLUSION: Health services need to communicate information regarding risks, ask about partnership preferences, create opportunities respecting individual differences, and ensure a positive response when patients raise safety concerns.",""

Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/056fa3b533442612d1c47d2f6d10980f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1232738c57971f3ec5727416735dc109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/161cfae92617522079abe6e1305c8271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/294eba95a1bd7ebc63b71920ef79c475, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46f621e2c2e9a6754ac31b91facb1e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f89158333fc8838938288c7cf5552b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65de6194054515a246da651e8c2e4aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/749f3795b2baf88bfb8c43d677cdb99f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dfab059fb6f39132cf97a7ebaaed1e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e326359580476629b048b6a28b3b6dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9102b367cf16b332f6cf854e812a0292, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/915e7aef7482da95ec018107eb20b53f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93c7ba6776cf719ed80a0870177afe16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b32729b101ba38005f2be7bbc1e3e0ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb3f0b0708131e090da256ddcefeaf47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0f270f6a6ef5688ef71c37adcc4ebd2"

Sex typically involves recombination of closely related DNA or RNA sequences, which is fundamentally a random process that creates but also breaks up beneficial allele combinations. Directed evolution experiments, which combine in vitro mutation and recombination protocols with in vitro or in vivo selection, have proved to be an effective approach for improving functionality of nucleic acids and enzymes. As this approach allows extreme control over evolutionary conditions and parameters, it also facilitates the detection of small or position-specific recombination benefits and benefits associated with recombination between highly divergent genotypes. Yet, in vitro approaches have been largely exploratory and motivated by obtaining improved end products rather than testing hypotheses of recombination benefits. Here, we review the various experimental systems and approaches used by in vitro studies of recombination, discuss what they say about the evolutionary role of recombination, and sketch their potential for addressing extant questions about the evolutionary role of sex and recombination, in particular on complex fitness landscapes. We also review recent insights into the role of ‘extracellular recombination’ during the origin of life.

While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF) influenza virus research, as an argument for why this research should not be performed. There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed. Given the importance of this historical epidemic to ongoing policy debates, we revisit the evidence that the 1977 epidemic was not natural and examine three potential origins: a laboratory accident, a live-vaccine trial escape, or deliberate release as a biological weapon. Based on available evidence, the 1977 strain was indeed too closely matched to decades-old strains to likely be a natural occurrence. While the origin of the outbreak cannot be conclusively determined without additional evidence, there are very plausible alternatives to the laboratory accident hypothesis, diminishing the relevance of the 1977 experience to the modern GOF debate.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b1e485aa89db80c1c6ac2827c63ea86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/117eefe0099f3e0b9c113ea0e7145433, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ff6dcad09d4d95bdf67b0b043e76b2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f27a118aa4bf20b51ed9d3eeffbcaf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f06be389d2945ab3655cb5bff0d0887, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e476e8632fd1b7b1c1da1a6f0ffca33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/804890e9e63ce19e24a2bce0b2316a4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8f58cc55d541123b52f35e7db26727f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4020b92760969ffc20f5277f58dffc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c61b2d98f3e38b0b1aed99f43390a323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8bd36826b2604a49aa582e2b4e8481b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cffe17f9bd77238a46b344f6959b8c88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5bf55c966db482bfc2794557756ec6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fefb532a24953d753d436bd053c39a6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff5f5ccbcfb991b3908bc05f2fec54bd"

It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n = 6) and B (n = 4) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n = 83). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway. We have developed a sensitive systems-level proteomic assay for the systematic quantification of naso-oro-pharyngeal proteins. The assay will advance mechanistic studies of respiratory pathology, by providing an untargeted and hypothesis-free approach of examining the airway proteome.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0695581f2c4b4805f8e2658060db898e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0edac6f213c2d75a99ee857701e53b87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ff36b6002b6faefa52ea481085475d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11dde53a9a4814013a4c221f58c3ff82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14568932df5328f9532294f6dcc1063d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b2aa8b25fae733f0ba1c573115f8d52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f17ce3e5df217ec6baa5c794954693d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/378b49a23a66e3142808bfac88b9b68a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/468391a784a19232fa28a3daaf63e246, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d3684454c9a1a3fea6c69fe997e6c00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ed1467114ebae2356f9d552dd8143e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f374849d291b836a7dee5066eec249b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/611af16303cf6e8edc95d865ee6ccd6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/683f3a6d94ed010ba0281af7c584d0a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/692ff774be004efbb45d5b9b8ebf4203, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7244ac62f81ee1c923500f6bef0e4925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73da991b93ea2134af8521fc08900233, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75deeed82a56d4434b6120f32ff558a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cc7b2c909d6a211ef11d252a3434da0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81b4a1ed529452c03e9048c702500115, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/850ecc8dde947eab0420604ca2422912, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8859300a8dc9409af4797d5da79bba4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89b16c326bf372059e514810a3b71d8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d1f87b71d2f44cdc97245f4a7f377ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9543f391e23ec893bf814df4730732f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/975f9abad558d68395ba406651f6517e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99684e319b4f7b690d2a0067c2037352, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b17e29476f5c35984b2427807cefe40e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b27485998cc5b688ef02e9f0d0501d44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6bf0e206555513ac5be192391b8bc33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb8f50fbdba87b5757fd31ba78436262, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/befb2a60e10eef7bdc652b8a047a1dac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c72ff838ce864e75d699df20819f8fbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc4481d597be53ee0bf049069ba5cab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1911f232a248cfb6e41e0a5981dffd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d376d4049fee2627b23bb644a3c70819, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3983ba7f43d6eb36348e3280ecdc87b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d973a361ae9893f41a1f9f723c950db8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de8504aac6f7123c6daed5126421cd6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4f10eba0b10686420c60234392bba13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eecfefa0de87b6a088c1f08bae84c35e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0b171519e471b2943cec6eaa0c8b5b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f821c1dcdc5bfa74110106f72ad48814, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd33f5196b7b1f15bb9607c27752b7fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe24b37dcfd80a9c8a7fc0d4ceff28ef"

Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its saturated counterpart, cyclopentylcytosine (carbodine, C-Cyd). Ce-Cyd also has potent cytocidal activity against a number of tumor cell lines. The putative target enzyme for both the antiviral and antitumor action of Ce-Cyd is assumed to be the CTP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this hypothesis was the finding that the antiviral and cytocidal effects of Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by Cyd and, to a lesser extent, Urd, but not by other nucleosides such as dThd or dCyd. In contrast, pyrazofurin and 6-azauridine, two nucleoside analogues that are assumed to interfere with OMP decarboxylase, another enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleotides, potentiate the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. Ce-Cyd should be further pursued, as such and in combination with OMP decarboxylase inhibitors, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of both viral and neoplastic diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f67085168ae8d4695a45ea158753dc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c19a2884832b046a452d238e227cc6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/454320c6dd58db0f9c389894ae82a1fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a86857e54accc6dd21cfba17915ce4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/526996379d7b9d3c10d3635b2abec7f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5df9fd997cfab9d1af72ea16d5b47e0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f47e8d8fd0bb03cdc30e6f1246d6bf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6076058bc851ee60d2eb919e92fb5ea6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70232a3978fe531b6ebc06cc44357469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8086a6f3e273770696aea1a5c3eed2da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f4aee31b6a3168d7ea610f67e4266ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c264bfbe2c524ee3a0ba3bb06140ef4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b15c149d8ff060d4968110b3afd44927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1bd30589c76b1c09f8d5577a00c41b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0e72a6afd862191bc0d537370744b96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9873bfd6d33b66daf4286c68c207c1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef5f8be3b2c811a059f676b3c1287774, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb1dfa54f85e0d80e03ac06d9ff17891"

Recently, a 30-nucleotide (nt) cis-replication stem-loop VI (SLVI) has been mapped at nt 101 to 130 within a 288-nt 5′-terminal segment of the 738-nt nsp1 cistron in a BCoV defective interfering (DI) RNA. Since a similar nsp1 coding region appears in all characterized groups 1 and 2 coronavirus DI RNAs and must be translated in cis for BCoV DI RNA replication, we hypothesized that nsp1 might regulate ORF 1 expression by binding this intra-nsp1 cistronic element. Here, we (i) establish by mutation analysis that the 72-nt intracistronic SLV immediately upstream of SLVI is also a DI RNA cis-replication signal, (ii) show by gel shift and UV-cross-linking analyses that cellular proteins of ∼60 and 100 kDa, but not viral proteins, bind SLV and SLVI, (SLV-VI) and (iii) demonstrate by gel shift analysis that nsp1 purified from Escherichia coli does not bind SLV-VI but does bind three 5′ untranslated region (UTR)- and one 3′ UTR-located cis-replication SLs. Notably, nsp1 specifically binds SLIII and its flanking sequences in the 5′ UTR with ∼2.5 μM affinity. Additionally, under conditions enabling expression of nsp1 from DI RNA-encoded subgenomic mRNA, DI RNA levels were greatly reduced, but there was only a slight transient reduction in viral RNA levels. These results together indicate that nsp1 is an RNA-binding protein that may function to regulate viral genome translation or replication but not by binding SLV-VI within its own coding region.",""

Many strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have distinct, S-dependent organ and tissue tropisms despite using a common receptor, suggesting that they employ different cellular proteases for fusion. In support of this hypothesis, we found that inhibition of endosomal acidification only modestly decreased entry, and overexpression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2 greatly enhanced entry, of the highly neurovirulent MHV strain JHM.SD relative to their effects on the reference strain, A59. However, TMPRSS2 overexpression decreased MHV structural protein expression, release of infectious particles, and syncytium formation, and endogenous serine protease activity did not contribute greatly to infection. We therefore investigated the importance of other classes of cellular proteases and found that inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)- and a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)-family zinc metalloproteases markedly decreased both entry and cell-cell fusion. Suppression of virus by metalloprotease inhibition varied among tested cell lines and MHV S proteins, suggesting a role for metalloprotease use in strain-dependent tropism. We conclude that zinc metalloproteases must be considered potential contributors to coronavirus fusion. IMPORTANCE The family Coronaviridae includes viruses that cause two emerging diseases of humans, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as a number of important animal pathogens. Because coronaviruses depend on host protease-mediated cleavage of their S proteins for entry, a number of protease inhibitors have been proposed as antiviral agents. However, it is unclear which proteases mediate in vivo infection. For example, SARS-CoV infection of cultured cells depends on endosomal acid pH-dependent proteases rather than on the cell surface acid pH-independent serine protease TMPRSS2, but Zhou et al. (Antiviral Res 116:76–84, 2015, doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011) found that a serine protease inhibitor was more protective than a cathepsin inhibitor in SARS-CoV-infected mice. This paper explores the contributions of endosomal acidification and various proteases to coronavirus infection and identifies an unexpected class of proteases, the matrix metalloproteinase and ADAM families, as potential targets for anticoronavirus therapy.",""

The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/042b2ec4bb4352a88f2b2b955d73cf84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06a416a167a0dba1445b05054c0a7cf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e07463f0053521b88d695db1aa987f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12aa30cfa44b9c4b44c47c2ac6b1383c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/139d8513e5a1fcf5f84afc7a0058b13e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18dbecbe2ca99e9a435f8b14576dbed5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/240f181dfa29197a060f119fee5b3203, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29fc0fde1a95c30dfe28dbb2241349b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31610bf63fe461a5e7943279ce3a11a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38e84dc0a9dffa2bfc22d735926c6b87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/431faea10d12d66b8a8170887f8b96cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d502154d396416a836e764ab4fea52e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64aa7afb9cca2f0d6405f79f1c07e576, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/661b6ea8f3593d5bb922379cdea11c82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c1e5abdf8ad44953958cf30ff472f49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/791ca66e7e339b07ca1666325cd6991f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c97a73c189ceb26f2dfc15b715a731f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8000cad77d8dc6d215cf9a4836549192, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dc88a4b90fe6f39840e43173da825ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dfd494b4a3b3e15716ab61843f60da8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/900cc11723531cd4341c0bd10652c6e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90dbed75ba2ac3e3da6b23f2477a6f6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9153f00426cbdfcbe2157e1e24b52231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a422719c85bc5d5997aea55105059331, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b79354b4760bf4fab3c6cc8de26d63be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b84df56170538e8c7b0fab158a1a2768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb3e1b6cc6612cd62b120cecd51f90c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6d73cf74b3fe49d67f76b49b43accb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8aea5bbf4cb0dcf6f41a574552d8844, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8c76254892fc4272128b8dbef015727, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcbf0608b609c0195b4c85cad02f896d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5ecefffdc68860a7ce4c0b15a53594e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e65cc76ea7186f7146f57ab768dc6f89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f05865be1c4231d4351e20e1ad6435ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffd34debd86601eee78b408540efbb9b"

There is no effective treatment for ARDS/ALI. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) through Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-generated Angiotensin II contributes to lung injury. ACE2, a recently discovered ACE homologue, acts as a negative regulator of the RAS and counterbalances the function of ACE. We hypothesized that ACE2 prevents Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury. Fourteen to 16-week-old ACE2 knockout mice—male (ACE2(−/y)) and female (ACE2(−/−))—and age-matched wild-type (WT) male mice received intratracheal BLM (1.5U/kg). Male ACE2(−/y) BLM injured mice exhibited poorer exercise capacity, worse lung function and exacerbated lung fibrosis and collagen deposition compared with WT. These changes were associated with increased expression of the profibrotic genes α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Transforming Growth Factor ß1. Compared with ACE2(−/y) exposed to BLM, ACE2(−/−) exhibited better lung function and architecture and decreased collagen deposition. Treatment with intraperitoneal recombinant human (rh) ACE2 (2 mg/kg) for 21 days improved survival, exercise capacity, and lung function and decreased lung inflammation and fibrosis in male BLM-WT mice. Female BLM WT mice had mild fibrosis and displayed a possible compensatory upregulation of the AT2 receptor. We conclude that ACE2 gene deletion worsens BLM-induced lung injury and more so in males than females. Conversely, ACE2 protects against BLM-induced fibrosis. rhACE2 may have therapeutic potential to attenuate respiratory morbidity in ALI/ARDS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0859cb6e1daa28f659a1398cc13a2034, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b0f9386729645ba48ec58a128aaf7a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b28490b3dd51b80905baf21e1b32f18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bcac2a41e33a1379ef5eeccd22d574a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/157b9bf9a4d14ec2bd774d183c769881, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/159d3e9ced82e523bb20784beec39e5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/190afb7f1df8fd88c3a97ad3538c9418, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ba8e527609998c0f890a957a25cd7ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22a4355d38781984e338cf784cca70ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23380514783e969570c2ef934eca47ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f2859a08eb1dbadb2e2f8a3fcb6d9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a1de51639f200efd2f5f5ed8db3ff1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31fdfe998ac3c0ea9bff7424f03a5739, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/337c664b2b1cde742017ae68521b7d61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35c081fecbab0c054532cc0468cb7417, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48f2665a3c193572f25eff6b785670b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49b4b0f83dd03b0d22745ace842fa552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f6380b24d1d153110133434f65b4ed7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52df05d8782ed6a50f745d9532df901e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b1ba1fa599c2401c70ad7e8a494ee53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c0b1085a71ac957e7361240bfc65ff6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/821112196f7380b7aa483e40d091cf8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/829b3b9e59df6cf456e0b134360efa2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/875624d355a42c62c5ee91f360f003ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/891442beb716de2e3e2eaa8ed95750dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919ba2f9596b5ca6524ff2bc5eae383f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97e124e660dd4df1d2fd720f6df7ecda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b17e4482e3e658626c0623f303266e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f6efe34ceed2d035d144042cf90e88c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8ca5bb536df34cd2ba3c590b772ed92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a95144642b9a61f5f13b1732f8178029, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a966e4475b4c974be5c16d7e52c80469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b37883588e2fb365c355cb73369b6d6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4cc06c57d22442d7807f7855f8cff10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b70529d302d493be909518b6c979667a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b821cc2e82237bf6d9ce5fa637d67d7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baedabe9587509e84dd5c8f2a7e3708d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd0810b5a5e68efbceaaf06533090e39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c134bea393f53dc311296aa91b2e1938, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c519aefb90893e57c6f6c7fbbf728111, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c55491840e2203a9c2b7c603f27b4303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8c1bbd2e54a6eaa967cf90105efca9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce608f43f0db1569d465d3cd5b8e36a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da97c980e46dfd387b1051228fcdf5a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daad27305ace9ea4811e29049d3c892b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3c175f8bf43ac99d3d389bb49d5d6c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4cb68149a4ceb0a6c781efce97d70a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5aaefc84e0c07b3fb4548ed3c9a4d55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e756bc001a385558076c79bf7715c3a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f298e636a8466fb497412e5bb72fff04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fae96a29eddebf316a40dfc2fa953228, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc631fbc31f1abd9e30def6249007840, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe546014cd2ef3f087b598382787000d"

We hypothesized that a combination of inflammatory markers would differentiate between severe and mild disease in RSV-infected children. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal samples from 52 RSV-infected children were collected during acute infection and after recovery. Retrospectively, patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity: mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Clinical data, number of flow-defined leukocyte subsets, and cytokine concentrations were compared. RESULTS: Children with severe RSV infection were characterized by young age; lymphocytopenia; increased interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-6 concentrations; and decreased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL-5) concentrations in plasma. The combination of plasma levels of IL-8 and CCL-5, and CD4(+) T-cell counts, with cutoff values of 67 pg/ml, 13 ng/ml, and 2.3 × 10(6)/ml, respectively, discriminated severe from mild RSV infection with 82% sensitivity and 96% specificity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the combination of CD4(+) T-cell counts and IL-8 and CCL-5 plasma concentrations correlates with disease severity in RSV-infected children. In addition to clinical features, these immunological markers may be used to assess severity of RSV infection and guide clinical management.

However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05bb6c7bd634a1d60ffda7953da8763f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08a2415c228ea708bf17dd34ff425983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ccf911b72dc2f0cae107cb00304b8a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f77e58bba3eeecebc5ec553adbf7794, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e06a7e385997a2cc647606982583529, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f43de2d6b5bf669be465ac0f21063df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30b82822fa2248c1265d1f1399a04d3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/314bf1c5f8e54334218db050ec7f5d27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35bfaa2c64d3adb4ac87590d5844a81d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bdaa19a2ff775484570641b90300a04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b539800aba7fab182a8a67b5cfb3c49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e24c9c98e7c8c698daac1eed4f45fe0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f23be42fe871b2352866c9b39cc9e94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5caf72a03517410e22c75d22b34f2cfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62beb385d7c40bfabdc3b5391b3f910e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6633e29ba27759c164fd1881ac3cf9be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67f99588bf539576f3c4695c98547377, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ca2a96abef39b9b06c05ed1388b6d82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6caff8ac189e54de886b3cc38d5fa88d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72c09f042db5e14328994926156b6780, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/823927c5ecb93e62451ed502271a1cb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8342c83daa1e308157c405df70898611, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93e2a589284aedb6f831f0fbbc5757c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cf7d1dafaa66f09bc933524b180539a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baa76090894dc7be3455c190eb11583d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd8d975a3ab5e427ef9c890fca99bab0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfb84dbdcc99e0db123a55f0379e8f32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca980eaf3f11e5200301ca2fd8f39a62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da7534d75a35ee9f186a69e554b35013, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd6f173af67350e90cb29d2882568cd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff5b62f3cc550dc2f677b5a9f1d52754, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff943038569ecb91f76b4f138b932f0d"

However, evolutionary processes promoting cross-species transfers are poorly defined, especially for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In theory, cross species transfers by arboviruses may be constrained by their alternating infection of disparate hosts, where optimal replication in one host involves a fitness tradeoff for the other. Accordingly, freeing arboviruses from alternate replication via specialization in a single host should accelerate adaptation. This hypothesis has been tested by using cell culture model systems with inconclusive results. Therefore, we tested it using an in vivo system with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an emerging alphavirus of the Americas. VEEV serially passaged in mosquitoes exhibited increased mosquito infectivity and vertebrate-specialized strains produced higher viremias. Conversely, alternately passaged VEEV experienced no detectable fitness gains in either host. These results suggest that arbovirus adaptation and evolution is limited by obligate host alternation and predict that arboviral emergence via host range changes may be less frequent than that of single host animal RNA viruses.",""

Biochemical analysis of the isolated membranes revealed that several organelles of the host cell (lysosomes, trans-Golgi stack and trans-Golgi network, and endoplasmic reticulum) contributed to the virus-induced membranous structures. Electron microscopy of infected cells preserved by high-pressure freezing revealed that the virus-induced membranes contain double lipid bilayers that surround apparently cytosolic material. Immunolabeling experiments showed that poliovirus proteins 2C and 3D were localized to the same membranes as the cellular markers tested. The morphological and biochemical data are consistent with the hypothesis that autophagy or a similar host process is involved in the formation of the poliovirus-induced membranes.",""

Recent epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that they are associated with 80 to 85 % of acute attacks of asthma in children, both in mild exacerbations, and in more severe exacerbations leading to hospital admission. The respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses are predominantly detected in infants, while rhinovirus and mycoplasma are the commonest viruses in children. The detailed mechanism of virus-induced exacerbations remains poorly understood, al though recent studies have provided evidence of increased activation of inflammatory cells in bronchial lavage. Allergic individuals, outside of periods of allergy, do not seem to have more virus-induced respiratory manifestations than nonallergic individuals. In contrast, rhinovirus infection may intensify both the immediate and late response to allergen challenge by increasing mast cell mediator release and recruitment of eosinophils in the lower airways. Human and animal studies suggest that local production of cytokines (IL4, IL8, RANTES, MIP-1a...) and the increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in asthmatic individuals, may play an important role for recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in the airways. One hypothesis, that remains to be demonstrated, would be that in the presence of Th2 predominance, as occurs in asthma, an excess of IL4 could inhibit the development of cytotoxic CD8, NK and Th1 activity, thereby resulting in decreased IFN production, more severe allergic inflammation and less efficient viral clearance.",""

Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post- and para-acrosomal areas. Taking into consideration the requirement of the acrosome reaction for sperm to become fusogenic, these results suggest that membrane raft dynamics may have a role in sperm-egg membrane interaction.",""

Similarly, there are accumulating data suggesting the role of the formation of reactive metabolites/intermediates through bioactivation in herbal toxicity and carcinogenicity. It has been hypothesized that the resultant reactive metabolites following herbal bioactivation covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, leading to toxicity via multiple mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity, oncogene activation, and hypersensitivity reactions. This is exemplified by aristolochic acids present in Aristolochia spp, undergoing reduction of the nitro group by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1/2) or peroxidases in extrahepatic tissues to reactive cyclic nitrenium ion. The latter was capable of reacting with DNA and proteins, resulting in activation of H-ras oncogene, gene mutation and finally carcinogenesis. Other examples are pulegone present in essential oils from many mint species; and teucrin A, a diterpenoid found in germander (Teuchrium chamaedrys) used as an adjuvant to slimming diets. Extensive pulegone metabolism generated p-cresol that was a glutathione depletory, and the furan ring of the diterpenoids in germander was oxidized by CYP3A4 to reactive epoxide which reacts with proteins such as CYP3A and epoxide hydrolase. On the other hand, some herbal/dietary constituents were shown to form reactive intermediates capable of irreversibly inhibiting various CYPs. The resultant metabolites lead to CYP inactivation by chemical modification of the heme, the apoprotein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the apoprotein. Some examples include bergamottin, a furanocoumarin of grapefruit juice; capsaicin from chili peppers; glabridin, an isoflavan from licorice root; isothiocyanates found in all cruciferous vegetables; oleuropein rich in olive oil; dially sulfone found in garlic; and resveratrol, a constituent of red wine. CYPs have been known to metabolize more than 95% therapeutic drugs and activate a number of procarcinogens as well. Therefore, mechanism-based inhibition of CYPs may provide an explanation for some reported herb-drug interactions and chemopreventive activity of herbs. Due to the wide use and easy availability of herbal medicines, there is increasing concern about herbal toxicity. The safety and quality of herbal medicine should be ensured through greater research, pharmacovigilance, greater regulatory control and better communication between patients and health professionals.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14cfeb8c51169e4aa8b1a8885fdd32ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16687b71ab97f42f53a4f6725a5b25f3,

A coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein, nsp14, contains conserved active-site motifs of cellular exonucleases, including DNA proofreading enzymes, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) nsp14 has 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity in vitro. Here, we show that nsp14 ExoN remarkably increases replication fidelity of the CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV). Replacement of conserved MHV ExoN active-site residues with alanines resulted in viable mutant viruses with growth and RNA synthesis defects that during passage accumulated 15-fold more mutations than wild-type virus without changes in growth fitness. The estimated mutation rate for ExoN mutants was similar to that reported for other RNA viruses, whereas that of wild-type MHV was less than the established rates for RNA viruses in general, suggesting that CoVs with intact ExoN replicate with unusually high fidelity. Our results indicate that nsp14 ExoN plays a critical role in prevention or repair of nucleotide incorporation errors during genome replication. The established mutants are unique tools to test the hypothesis that high replication fidelity is required for the evolution and stability of large RNA genomes.",""

We tested the hypothesis that inflammation disrupts developmental cortical plasticity in vivo using the mouse ocular dominance model of experience-dependent plasticity in primary visual cortex. We found that the administration of systemic lipopolysaccharide suppressed plasticity during juvenile critical period with accompanying transcriptional changes in a particular set of molecular regulators within primary visual cortex.

One favored mechanism to explain the role of viruses in the genesis of autoimmunity is molecular mimicry. An immunoinflammatory blinding lesion called herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) that follows ocular infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) is suggested to result from a CD4(+) T-cell response to a UL6 peptide of HSV that cross-reacts with a corneal autopeptide shared with the immunoglobulin G2a(b) (IgG2a(b)) isotype. The present report reevaluates the molecular mimicry hypothesis to explain HSK pathogenesis. Our results failed to reveal cross-reactivity between the UL6 and IgG2a(b) peptides or between peptide reactive T cells and HSV antigens. More importantly, animals infected with HSV failed to develop responses that reacted with either peptide, and infection with a recombinant vaccinia UL6 vector failed to cause HSK, in spite of generating UL6 reactivity. Other lines of evidence also failed to support the molecular mimicry hypothesis, such as the failure to affect HSK severity upon tolerization of susceptible BALB/c and B-cell-deficient mice with IgG2a(b) or UL6 peptides. An additional study system revealed that HSK could be induced in mouse strains, such as the OT2 × RAG1(−/−) mice (T cell receptor transgenic recognizing OVA(323–339)) that were unable to produce CD4(+) T-cell responses to any detectable HSV antigens.

When the mutation is propagated on the C57/BL6J genetic background, total fat mass rises significantly with age, and glucose intolerance and systemic insulin resistance develop at 6 months of age. This study was carried out to determine the mechanisms underlying the marked increase in total fat mass in 6-month-old mutants. Indirect calorimetry analysis showed that Cc1(−/−) mice develop hyperphagia and a significant reduction in physical activity, in particular in the early hours of the dark cycle, during which energy expenditure is only slightly lower than in wild-type mice. They also exhibit increased triglyceride accumulation in skeletal muscle, due in part to incomplete fatty acid β-oxidation. Mechanistically, hypothalamic leptin signaling is reduced, as demonstrated by blunted STAT3 phosphorylation in coronal sections in response to an intracerebral ventricular injection of leptin. Hypothalamic fatty-acid synthase activity is also elevated in the mutants. Together, the data show that the increase in total fat mass in Cc1(−/−) mice is mainly attributed to hyperphagia and reduced spontaneous physical activity. Although the contribution of the loss of CEACAM1 from anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus is unclear, leptin resistance and elevated hypothalamic fatty-acid synthase activity could underlie altered energy balance in these mice.",""

While Semantic Web technologies, such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL), provide powerful techniques for representing existing knowledge, well-established OWL reasoners are unable to account for missing or uncertain knowledge. The application of inductive inference methods, like machine learning and network inference are vital for extending our current knowledge. Therefore, robust methods which facilitate inductive inference on rich OWL-encoded knowledge are needed. Here, we propose OWL-NETS (NEtwork Transformation for Statistical learning), a novel computational method that reversibly abstracts OWL-encoded biomedical knowledge into a network representation tailored for network inference. Using several examples built with the Open Biomedical Ontologies, we show that OWL-NETS can leverage existing ontology-based knowledge representations and network inference methods to generate novel, biologically-relevant hypotheses. Further, the lossless transformation of OWL-NETS allows for seamless integration of inferred edges back into the original knowledge base, extending its coverage and completeness.",""

We tested the hypothesis that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a signal sequence or patch encoded in its cytosolic domain. cDNAs encoding gpI wild type (wt) and a truncated mutant gpI(trc) lacking transmembrane and cytosolic domains were cloned by using the PCR. Cells transfected with cDNA encoding gpI(wt) or gpI(trc) synthesized and N glycosylated the proteins. gpI(wt) accumulated in the TGN, some reached the plasmalemma, but none was secreted. In contrast, gpI(trc) was retained and probably degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum; none was found on cell surfaces, but some was secreted. The distribution of gpI(trc) was not affected by deletion of potential glycosylation sites. To locate a potential gpI-targeting sequence, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain of a plasmalemmal marker, the interleukin-2 receptor (tac), was fused to different domains of gpI. A chimeric protein in which tac was fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gpI was targeted to the TGN. In contrast, a chimeric protein in which tac was fused only with the gpI transmembrane domain passed through the TGN and concentrated in endosomes. We conclude that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a targeting sequence or patch in its cytosolic domain.",""

Proteins in plasma and BAL from two neutropenic rabbit models of IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS. Hierarchical clustering analysis of plasma time course spectra demonstrated two clusters of peaks that were differentially regulated between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia (57 and 34 peaks, respectively, p<0.001). PCA of plasma proteins demonstrated a time-dependent separation of the two infections. A random forest analysis that ranked the top 30 spectral points distinguished between late Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Based on spectral data analysis, three proteins were identified using SDS-PAGE and LC/MS and quantified using reverse phase arrays. Differences in the temporal sequence of plasma haptoglobin (p <0.001), apolipoprotein A1 (p<0.001) and transthyretin (p<0.038) were observed between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as was C-reactive protein (p<0.001). In summary, proteomic analysis of plasma and BAL proteins of experimental Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias demonstrates unique protein profiles with principal components and spectral regions that are shared in early infection and diverge at later stages of infection. Haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin and C-reactive protein are differentially expressed in these infections suggesting important contributions to host defense against IPA.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0421c41594541c9f78824289e847a131, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0590ed2358145958220347f517bf964d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06261cd30f796830fee4da721a027451, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e59e396458922ca47a12749910e78ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/117053f2f5c8609bff715f5377d8b1ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1724df081b084a3d5377309346698f2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/191a874f03221e2707bd8a1fcbdb5b8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ad86c663fd41d8fbf98d3ca86d51402, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bd86e18cff905be0bead0c54f80a38d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23aee8e7fdff2619363f808c5579b62f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31f8a0f7c8a9bab7c6c4086fef1e6937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/363665055df40402bb89a61c56b383a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cae2a78dd44e66b868ff081ecb75097, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4531f911f803f26f7cfb9c09fd9b4efa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/495966c3b881aa24b18deba682d4f795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c931e5167c2eaadd82495d05599c6b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fdb76eac78ef448e4d3a7bc77e79ad9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51f299873d5eaeec7addeefa308829d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cc02c95502590ca0dd9e14c552b39be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e317ff407997e49882a2b7f3c293438, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75545becf642773d9de5e0d78bee522f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b2399917c923a6830b65c308677bc51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89b1bd510eac4bacd0a5e9b821412d2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9586650d253a11b26f7ef3df2d8db262, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/966ddd79b97b80adfb64bde2fdaeede7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97ad4703337b7e318d349b428e69ea01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f4c467c083a59de3b59d0d2db6e9ace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0d9f02bb7c7f1fbb61dc25f9e2e06de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b12031817067db72af54b688128d1276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd532cb9b7352054fc658fe34d0afc08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be0036bed6fc85c964f64a69ad38313f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c15a1513e838a0872e2b1cf3bb4423ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c907c2d99341aca09db22601ea463093, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdb5ccf371042ec97a0de767636097c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d132815200be0b4672f4f1e27088a066, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db8a66ced0d7e08410f21c3904fc46a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e38696bb64ff1b438c8907fd7e78a157, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e80822c8b398e01b741cf50e57acb086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8494b518ceede9e771b777108df397d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed3e5a18a8594caddef0afbaa901e62d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f25e18e8cdb070162cebc1c86536f09d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6615c19366d3d9500297c4d77b3e03c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f748980b18b487255eee6c72765df185, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbdb7e4b8a63aa6fe45b670dffbabe33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe2a005d10b9a80ea028d27cafac9286, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff2f96474bc5e4570e7d08e08c63ffb7"

This motif is missing from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), resulting in high level of surface expression of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: It has been shown that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses. One of them is the 3a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo. The 3a protein, which contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization. In addition, 3a can bind to the spike protein and through this interaction, it may be able to cause the spike protein to become internalized, resulting in a decrease in its surface expression. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The effects of 3a on the internalization of cell surface spike protein can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology. IMPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the spike protein via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses. The interaction between 3a and S, which are expressed from separate subgenomic RNA, would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of S. The cell surface expression of S in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly, viral spread and viral pathogenesis. Modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus.",""

This fact poses stringent conditions on their transmission mode, demanding, in particular, a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) for successful propagation. The actual advantages of the multipartite viral strategy are as yet unclear. The origin of multipartite viruses represents an evolutionary puzzle. While classical theories suggested that a faster replication rate or higher replication fidelity would favour shorter segments, recent experimental results seem to point to an increased stability of virions with incomplete genomes as a factor able to compensate for the disadvantage of mandatory complementation. Using as main parameters differential stability as a function of genome length and MOI, we calculate the conditions under which a set of complementary segments of a viral genome would outcompete the non-segmented variant. Further, we examine the likeliness that multipartite viral forms could be the evolutionary outcome of the competition among the defective genomes of different lengths that spontaneously arise under replication of a complete, wild-type genome. We conclude that only multipartite viruses with a small number of segments could be produced in our scenario, and discuss alternative hypotheses for the origin of multipartite viruses with more than four segments.",""

Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface displayed L-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis we synthesized a 20-amino acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An L-Rha-cholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetraethylene glycol (TEG) as a linker. The liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the non-immunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting the proposed effect on antigen presentation. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the vaccinated mice serum recognized MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/010bb8ecfc333e9bcfdf9ca607663232, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02aac03b81807355b5b4cfc2b3d91cfb,

The proteasome inhibitor MG132 or surfactant protein C (SP-C) BRICHOS domain mutation G100S induced apoptosis in human AECs by activating the proapoptotic cathepsin D and reducing antiapoptotic angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). This study tested the hypothesis that ER stress-induced apoptosis of human AECs might be mediated by influence of the unfolded protein response (UPR) on the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system. A549 cells were challenged with MG132 or SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S to induce ER stress and activation of UPR pathways. The results showed that either MG132 or G100S SP-C mutation activated all three canonical pathways of the UPR (IRE1/XBP1, ATF6, and PERK/eIF2α), which led to a significant increase in cathepsin D or in TACE (an ACE-2 ectodomain shedding enzyme) and eventually caused AEC apoptosis. However, ER stress-induced AEC apoptosis could be prevented by chemical chaperone or by UPR blockers. It is also suggested that ATF6 and IRE1 pathways might play important role in regulation of angiotensin system. These data demonstrate that ER stress induces apoptosis in human AECs through mediation of UPR pathways, which in turn regulate the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system. They also demonstrated that ER stress-induced AEC apoptosis can be blocked by inhibition of UPR signaling pathways.",""

In the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), cytokines elicited by primary and secondary infections seem to exert subtle and sustained effects on behavioral, hormonal, and metabolic axes, and their combined effects on appetite and metabolism have been postulated to drive wasting. However, correlations of increased blood levels of a particular cytokine with wasting in AIDS have not been consistent observations, perhaps because cytokines act principally as paracrine and autocrine hormones, as well as indirectly by activating other systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the catabolic effects of cytokines is clearly needed if more efficacious strategies are to be developed for the prevention and treatment of wasting in AIDS. In this review we first examine the interacting factors contributing to the AIDS wasting syndrome. We then analyze the complex and overlapping role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of this condition, and put forward a number of hypotheses to explain some of the most important features of this syndrome.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1713966e53c5ec12f97d536335574e47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2361401de78c054d5a535240c993d100, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ecb134e2b85779055e21912c6c4cc7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b00efecc2408d7a17e86118a5a0f71a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f6c19dc59ac4fc7c9ea8dc713a7151b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5661a837f251e39930e07d2066876ee7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56c59f8929fc3721d1081d1faef99521, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58ac4733150b28ccbec6dc1d451900f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/646cc947ab1c7dcf6db60acfc0161935, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79b572c435802e2e7d77eea1b2144b79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cf6b236b8fed2937997964650aae596, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91fec150152ffd7dbc7872a37bb46850, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98480872e558cb159b4c4756d6c230b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d3f02ad1a15308368f522adf239fdb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b16b1a9e9643fd1c03c09e147ed4e638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d5345fb71fc36f91ed78047f6b4eab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0bafe0e7eb2681e996dfe2a6fdcc836, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1110404889bd960a02086741b1e10e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1d346e117e4a5917543c5a6375b446b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc6c4812ba3eff161c7759384f6da3c5"

This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/012736dd580d6d2cdc6b36f4b0d94bec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/017d6d6e983d2e7fb751d7846e3a7ee6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/047d35c8f73f7e5b4f3d5b2fdf91a919, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0534fb66598ba4f49c7cb9df87c1e4f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09644e5a1774699d78f5ba802fcdef3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17b4da643437d5c14a4b3798ba1a0c9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c5439fde7fca80863ba1f76683b7f2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3851a0715c37b51da0e3a93db960a78a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/484f2dfc3195a055a73c755d369b395e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/490703953f97ca33e55de547338cf71c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b351ef404b73bef58363fd3f029eed9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c3e5fc63014cfc14fdb2c878579c4e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/528d93d1bb413148f5ded8719141dcc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5655067d7f390cbe3d3a0a60d0bdd455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b23902716cfc53434338052d794fe6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f2a3f43b4ab038c521628382eb8f920, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6faf01dad0ff37036679d53dac86d177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/757377e548a496d98e391754627ed9ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ff7638046803149c28a04d581b58367, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/803b7ef390b9d0b9c5ba0d0f1e5949f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81d67b14a86b977dbd3a672180d37222, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cb19cadfd7fdc28a6c17bb3295eff18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9572c45df660f9b6d99c3b31138d541e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98d0b79add6742d42b0cec6e3de439f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3d62c69dd55fc9e233bf9ae19f2c944, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a64834f56b74a903911e30d0fea64d00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8af9fdab8aca0b43dd12066f119d819, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a98a7800aeb6d21e1264e0eb5d217f62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9a71c77c9b2fb6747d52da375c09cfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af6826148da7517581536dd31cc0fe36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2ba292af0170a7a048f7945dfd0dfec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b343f4cc167a435d21b18b3fdc288bd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3580140636cc0643633b8b370ca7a90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b60e27494b0e2dd2249967fece8b72bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b95e6e9678fcc549ee4e11630739ddc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5840bfb2fcb2140b2e05b971058797b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca7a821f66921948ccbf2f0110544219, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d057610ccb005474da7090e37415b4ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4541b3cc895a5da5e85867ce60b85e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7ad9f32608c16871e7aef805adbfcc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da9fc8e1ef9f1848b584b9c7bf430616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3378a682f27f37374474afb66bd3b40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f686b0b405f177e575e254a57328fa3e"

Two well-studied virulence factors implicated in the adhesion process are filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN). We hypothesized that both FHA and PRN would serve critical roles in the adhesion process and be necessary for colonization of the swine respiratory tract. To investigate the role of FHA and PRN in Bordetella pathogenesis in swine, we constructed mutants containing an in-frame deletion of the FHA or the PRN structural gene in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate. Both mutants were compared to the wild-type swine isolate for their ability to colonize and cause disease in swine. Colonization of the FHA mutant was lower than that of the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, the PRN mutant caused similar disease severity relative to the wild type; however, colonization of the PRN mutant was reduced relative to the wild type during early and late infection and induced higher anti-Bordetella antibody titers. Together, our results indicate that despite inducing different pathologies and antibody responses, both FHA and PRN are necessary for optimal colonization of the swine respiratory tract.",""

Factors underlying high viral diversity in bats are the subject of speculation. We hypothesize that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals.

Early studies showed monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. We approached this problem straightforwardly. We tested the hypothesis that increasing virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses. Here, we show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. We for the first time generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a4d319ed925cb33c5bbbd8d73e5e439, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24d7901b62dd548a5924d13fc8de290e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/366f46a16fd6ebdd897dbe364a624cc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b4fa39463b6ab53aeb69f8264c0cad7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40df61808b4414a0145f4c7a57117e26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43dd973abcb311842dc1ee27b3320038, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4adf8ebcd8fd8e2b99ebcadf8621f73a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57166ca50aab27cbd1b2a3d1c5828590, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5730c4c69c6fa38cc2063737b873c6b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b8725d1aafd5a8decac00cdb5b52f8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bc501aae08331c58881cf5f7ad047fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d9f9f5947cb8d52e2a2bbf7a0dfa8b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fd2deff277ca77ca2f89341c4b16a0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71c22bf3e81b172ad45e1ab824a1df24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89738dc7cddb49b30f8a9c85df445786, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a72444639870304eb9cc8e35cded481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c26b1d3c5f5cafbde304782d107979b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/938ee62617dc15d6485a8da91ad0a8aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a26b208a2326b639aaf76eb0e4264578, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3d1dfa888fe0b142e115b6c1df83ac6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa82180cce91ad3936846d01c1fb9cd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad3d0e92196e9e410e7153360ac55777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf481a80811465594a6a1e9a34757a46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1a89f8b77389693f8b705b6490fa2d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1ae1224222739309ab7116c9a42918c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d156ad1cf07cfccba3b6aee28f995a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb7550e0a1d97a486eaba74958097b60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee48cc58753a6919f18855d5b4fa8da7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef838ba0e41f812543d5e94ede6222b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0e1090675f8a42b3c103b0f1fdbc291, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7592a5385032599d27154d9e2c99fd4"

Here, we studied IL17A from five lagomorphs, European rabbit, pygmy rabbit, brush rabbit, European brown hare, and American pika. We observed that this protein is highly conserved between these species, with a similarity of 97–99% in leporids and ~88% between leporids and American pika. The exon/intron structure, N-glycosylation sites, and cysteine residues are conserved between lagomorphs. However, at codon 88, one of the interaction sites between IL17A and its receptor IL17RA, there is an Arg>Pro mutation that only occurs in European rabbit and European brown hare. This could induce critical alterations in the IL17A structure and conformation and consequently modify its function. The differences observed between leporids and humans or rodents might also represent important alterations in protein structure and function. In addition, as for other interleukins, IL17A sequences of human and European rabbit are more closely related than the sequences of human and mouse or European rabbit and mouse. This study gives further support to the hypothesis that European rabbit might be a more suitable animal model for studies on human IL17.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0152fc1faeb1f2b5b90c8141418d9d83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/017ef3a2c85a57d1f6276d7df2371533, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13ec60c9b98f1f48917a3f5bd443c117, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e26e9dab0de42c9ddfa908d1f57c868, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cd6d4884f07392014926813177f7ad9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d76334797f6aaafa1788e7afb3f0a3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32a655272b676da67db8f6bb51cf52f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33d10a9a53aea4f24785dc444cc80495, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37d115427c6eb81c00740190f702bb68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c47cfb027c3823a870f22e29e72b217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3df0adc2fbdc8ca9a2dd4117027453bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e986a5823053faa90f9487ccadf3f78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e9b0c67e5d01e2a434c4e5bd3b75f20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ff0482a1c35d71c51d2700837612e5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41ff229c011d911ea9688e82ec3ef873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a870f208891ab195592586f2e84f4f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c23ff15a39917675234f4a35ca7ec1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4db9f8590f34c40b9d045ff8ff112c82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/506e9869da22fd536a46f4f7b7fcbeb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/520f10ea944f18cd1a379a993f243065, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56a2b1d216ac51a9936dda2b5da55031, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e2ab334f0e7ddf6d24e9fb2e8a73835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/607d35570e76aee5d27c9ff1014c4c76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63cc2b6042fa98433414ea05e66dbc15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67e373db9571e93810dc8343842f5110, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6df1f9a5ac6ea9696dd999bb97ef1848, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74f039b2eaa755697013052e1886e1da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79b50fcb8f86d33025e5eecfae89e987, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79b74e852a16b30dafec428234bdbd9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/851879c4390c5a5afd35e123c09a0c5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929dbb9b85d0d5df46ef598a241f3bd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96ffe786a14c5116a8d7ff5f17818aa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d8581ec4f82386668107318e9459c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f0a66abb0cebd87916ae2fba13b80a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a35292818bb108e92e26296fb092a7e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afbf59f1ab962145d9572c60fa28b84c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b01e723b48be81946a3a744ad6fc8cff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0105a05be7fcb47ab9a81de792be93e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1177fefebb89bf7c2a6ca821f72c5f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d69321458db45a61e837fd835b3298ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9970a7e69aca9d1406b1df99b08b45d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd111a27ad3d49894b0e7c533303840c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21ae8fb4b05eef8a75f0fc6d7e49ec3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8ec3a04502ac4daf7eaa3e13d5609c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9a7f2de71327bc8e63255b5fc30f42f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdd04e5befc398a09e317175ecd9f9c8"

Objective We hypothesized that early prebiotic or probiotic supplementation would reduce the risk of virus-associated RTIs during the first year of life in a cohort of preterm infants. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT00167700), 94 preterm infants (gestational age, ≥32 + 0 and ≤36 + 6 weeks; birth weight, >1500 g) treated at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, were allocated to receive oral prebiotics (galacto-oligosaccharide and polydextrose mixture, 1:1), a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103), or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) between days 3 and 60 of life. The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically defined virus-associated RTI episodes confirmed from nasal swabs by using nucleic acid testing. Secondary outcomes were the severity and duration of RTIs. Results A significantly lower incidence of RTIs was detected in infants receiving prebiotics (rate ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.49; P < .001) or probiotics (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.90; P = .022) compared with those receiving placebo. Also, the incidence of rhinovirus-induced episodes, which comprised 80% of all RTI episodes, was found to be significantly lower in the prebiotic (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.66; P = .003) and probiotic (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.00; P = .051) groups compared with the placebo group. No differences emerged among the study groups in rhinovirus RNA load during infections, duration of rhinovirus RNA shedding, duration or severity of rhinovirus infections, or occurrence of rhinovirus RNA in asymptomatic infants. Conclusions Gut microbiota modification with specific prebiotics and probiotics might offer a novel and cost-effective means to reduce the risk of rhinovirus infections.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b98766416273950ce3328e79ec949e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e9b4fca9f06b9460b6d2fa55ff46631, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30b3cb76e97c6ae570d8d0fb8509445a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/326144f9f7aeb87b6f889484fa7caee9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38717ecb64049685c6fce89b98f7f504, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/393de9f40275babf08c323701dc47404, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3980f568e8a39a615644d4ad61e16363, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bdf12defd4e4a03e9da40545d9bfc18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40ac619b24b4a5caced97c0dc725d6ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4324144fdbc646b945969475576f00fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d7bd26b67f3adad5a4231500438bb33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59dfb7bb346cc685ae94c65b253dd2cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5adbbd6ffaf9df1a82a397b8759811e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c65716b298a45e8b73f03b1ed5596cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64da9c04ab11641c265bd15e468a6f5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/679be536218672fc51de6cec96d48026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68f268d0dc93bcf88c20777da706ba17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/710f1be37ee18dc5dd066e56f83071e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76cb4e9162868b163baf0013080a30c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/775cfd56171ffec96b6ae7926b94c870, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83f0165ab6ab0c0ccef7d2a534914838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f80c2f7c9281c05af6d7f114b907d47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f36f66c2ea476c6edafdcc71f8cb2c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f46a5b8f8eb6560c20474d4edd385fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3d15acd5697e8a1fec64c2b316d8936, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a61d38846836ded30c72178f47d90ae1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9a2b6b1c923788ef15999d835c94aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abb25dd3c0ea5aee341d96550112aed0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad0b7f5d65053953f24610f96cbe5901, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b475468582a1b8b3d8eb96103a7efd35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b67ac76b18c7c66185ff678f708c4ec4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9101658ebd1bb7dd85c01107b54211d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b91ef66f82cf736899dd70f05daa3b95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbc7c4dbbec43d3e83266e96f886c22b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c83da89b945816b0cdd5818eed9949ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc7119ef52c2e8f712047afe6ec51408, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce708bbc57bfd2a29840621369d6a7aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7e1a19fda54c7f8c5821837e0f1cf46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8bc21f59ec511b454da5650e549cf7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dff315f9350ff8c92468b78f71d8755b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed3239d04f3cc2202367b4ccbbe3f4e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f78acc92d5f3f7e35f2e7f3483619c18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f966508df2df220010d66b14c60c9690, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb7b9cfff5b6fffb71c36c8f64fe7517"

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mice challenged with S rectivirgula, and S rectivirgula induces MCP-1 secretion by alveolar macrophages. We tested the hypothesis that MCP-1 and its receptor CC chemokine receptor-2 (CCR2) are essential to the development of experimental HP by treating mice with MCP-1 antibody and using CCR2−/− mice. Administration of anti–MCP-1 did not change the response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula. CCR2−/− animals responded in a fashion similar to that of wild-type animals to intratracheally administered.S rectivirgula. To determine the influence of the MCP-1–CCR2 interaction in vitro, we transferred S rectivirgula–cultured spleen cells from S rectivirgula–sensitized mice, to naïve recipients. Later, challenge of the recipients with intratracheal S rectivirgula and examination of both lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid characteristics were used to determine whether adoptive transfer had occurred. We found that cultured cells from CCR2−/− animals were fully capable of adoptive transfer. We conclude that interaction of MCP-1 with CCR2 is not necessary for the development of pulmonary inflammation in response to intratracheally administered S rectivirgula or cells able to adoptively transfer experimental HP.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0901c8edafe2e056cef7268c1a6e1ae9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a5a352f80c6f7b3e2c2a6e0e915fd71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/197179462280bb4bb04dc59a75722605, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19d99ee26964746f24534f4ac50a9b96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e27b10497994491d6ac407851bc31c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f02f0cdd6c1f12c6a71858edd426401, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28c62be85dac655763edce9488e540ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/387b39f62dbfa3624d9bcb56ab49b36d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39382271038bd007d5c6fdd8453afc72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40e278ce5b91e64adf2116e932ddf963, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41dee4c6349e225a6de8634494e64109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44ecf46cae4b1f1a0a6f614b8f974b93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/496b8021551eaa5d16df6fdc222e5294, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49e8b5ff9e64633724bcaee572b0db51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ac29905847eebadeb8df0b3a6f7c3ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5aea63e041447e7c34affa1ac59636d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e07134dda8dbc790723275f91ae0bf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/604430a57b41809316507ffae84542f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61b4da5d3800ec3e4570835e315d2d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68ae46919c2f1e77498a736b87d2c613, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75606ceaa8ff479c5f4a428fc82e86d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7930e01d986aed0a5a916d561be11816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e3ec8fa9d1539e566700c169073a6f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8785c89fd1224e34f619ecf8be294f29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8af12b559377ca09cd2af75a8326e891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c1401d48a72e1d4081b9c044f4ab54a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c2be85c4ec220c82ae028d12bc59329, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c8b6939912daf96dfdc7865548ccee8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cf597bae1bab79aeec232d79740b363, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91d9365633ecfe3013d27bd932f196f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9327be9b503c7e03e2c0b45f22e84544, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/933866d7879fde98f24dfcb19c8a6b2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a53cf09ef1aa068d9096d7fb2582ecbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a839252b846a3e7bdfa45de53f0164e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae744ffef04627debc6c351bb83c77d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b021e5db591bb11b0f35472e810cb544, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1df204d5e885e7beade7013c2d7c67e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb090e6eb00bffae814cbc92056d582d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4b95fc659de554f3403289d2b4b848e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9aa6bc90f9975adfb2b459a5056cfcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbe4ff1c4d47e4082a36c6854f1a361a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cebadcfab28343ea9085d5bbab039924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0780a850b7a0d24a9c8b40036f7b876, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d91a7f0b6ce4c508608d71bbc7c834aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daf09d7a1fd36f2cb436cdaa76775ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbe241086ebbcc6e54dd4c62834886bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e045630c5965deded5199f771ae71823, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4e212def65f0db49e0d2a64f4dd5626, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e64df3cb99282fe9fbd8e092bfc0818a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef4144d2134a5466a4541b7c333deedc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1fca0f1f03fdc2f866ddaa71ea3676f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2e0daec7924a06acb84d47b6deba2ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2fc8f46fd360b190c7abb4f28fcbecd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f642838d8398f9c927a2c457835ef508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c899fb23eac136cecfe447520f383d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc189a17279e8206478c38378f1c257b"

Immunosuppression is used to treat AIH and ursodeoxycholic acid is used to slow the progression of PBC. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with both disorders progress to liver failure. Following liver transplantation, up to a third of patients with PBC experience recurrent disease. Moreover a syndrome referred to as “de novo AIH” occurs in a proportion of patients regardless of maintenance immunosuppression, who have been transplanted for disorders unrelated to AIH. Of note, the use of cyclosporine A appears to protect against the development of recurrent PBC and de novo AIH even though it is a less potent immunosuppressive compared to tacrolimus. The reason why cyclosporine A is protective has not been determined. However, a virus resembling mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been characterized in patients with PBC and AIH. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the protective effect of cyclosporine A in liver transplant recipients may be mediated by the antiviral activity of this cyclophilin inhibitor. Treatment of the MMTV producing MM5MT cells with different antivirals and immunosuppressive agents showed that both cyclosporine A and the analogue NIM811 inhibited MMTV production from the producer cells. Herein, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of MMTV-like human betaretrovirus in the development of PBC and de novo AIH and speculate on the possibility that the agent may be associated with disease following transplantation. We also review the mechanisms of how both cyclosporine A and NIM811 may inhibit betaretrovirus production in vitro.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e4b704335b127017e8a43ab6ffba251, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10896d151350ab2199fd99cd3d4d6d4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c26175ca1da563a0332082e24106185, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21dc1dcc2f8c55e004d1171e35effcb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cd71825d3dea5dd9150ffd8ad5ffd48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33cbf1c4b8a1a1717c259ad0550135a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34d63bc245d414904f7802e037db71f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b41237bef6c6e9fb3cee9bf26759bd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3be8616a84e77db618a8768db845da97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44f896b88624f6ece3442ac732b9f7b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f6d4d9bf54f4efa72d7265daf49c02d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a078a3e2c6a71708554109c6777af9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6228ba1220cd2833a53887d79305ab38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6349033c3cfdf01ce0b62a665a2386fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a52128c9f329187c103267981c3838d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7abd4b490c046d4c89164d367ccf60dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/816699b2ead17868826c824c485772d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82459859dcb830b87ebf65393a04dd1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8968377cfc05d8d70de73a6011cc1890, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93a8a353ec98d4050b4b33304432e9f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9caeaa61b741ae6851a852c3082183e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ecc2fef875bd4bd1fb5ec721ff6b5b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f13926941027561877ec18d33253b4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a06d28b23eb49b0f8fafc0659ab313aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ec5f8ca6f80cfb7d09662170966823, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b613d841e768c848afbe330fd3219321, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b76fd6e2af2d901fe1f95bfb9adf4958, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba5ee5a9116d0b08d69b03f334356ad1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb12016cdac943335e4ed24d3049473e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb30c024ebe60f9774d2affbff78ddf7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb3598331ecc3dbc56c3599d5d94b0c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf130c8f3f066d1f20e97cb9d3d939c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c45f29123eb2c17a4f6dc96c83161ab7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7e8a0948e7b871fd173e46b5f3db1ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d453a884c6c45acb463fb520b1919e68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7ce685682e88f5b635b3f6ad148384c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db011e55607efc25cb1f15bedd45fb62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/decd32d36c36140019ff80e6ec1a1410, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e841e27da39eb7a41ee979151fe31d89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1f05f287a17c889feb2e270736a1acc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5a8d3fc2478d3c4856e273ba194f030, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f904c2574ec6b96cdba4ad218ac04b99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc9f94a85facf16b8b46e65d8de5d72c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcee00c24a63b718c5f44348e0852b3a"

Data accumulated by different laboratories suggest their neurotropic potential. For example, primary cultures of human astrocytes and microglia were shown to be susceptible to an infection by the OC43 strain of HuCV (A. Bonavia, N. Arbour, V. W. Yong, and P. J. Talbot, J. Virol. 71:800–806, 1997). We speculate that the neurotropism of HuCV will lead to persistence within the central nervous system, as was observed for murine coronaviruses. As a first step in the verification of our hypothesis, we have characterized the susceptibility of various human neural cell lines to infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen, infectious virus progeny, and viral RNA were monitored during both acute and persistent infections. The astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG, U-373 MG, and GL-15, as well as neuroblastoma SK-N-SH, neuroglioma H4, oligodendrocytic MO3.13, and the CHME-5 immortalized fetal microglial cell lines, were all susceptible to an acute infection by HuCV-OC43. Viral antigen and RNA and release of infectious virions were observed during persistent HuCV-OC43 infections (∼130 days of culture) of U-87 MG, U-373 MG, MO3.13, and H4 cell lines. Nucleotide sequences of RNA encoding the putatively hypervariable viral S1 gene fragment obtained after 130 days of culture were compared to that of initial virus input. Point mutations leading to amino acid changes were observed in all persistently infected cell lines. Moreover, an in-frame deletion was also observed in persistently infected H4 cells. Some point mutations were observed in some molecular clones but not all, suggesting evolution of the viral population and the emergence of viral quasispecies during persistent infection of H4, U-87 MG, and MO3.13 cell lines. These results are consistent with the potential persistence of HuCV-OC43 in cells of the human nervous system, accompanied by the production of infectious virions and molecular variation of viral genomic RNA.",""

To investigate this hypothesis, we used targeted molecular and genetic approaches with cultured neurons to study cell-intrinsic host defense pathways primarily using the neurotropic alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). We found that WEEV activated IRF-3-mediated neuronal innate immune pathways in a replication-dependent manner, and abrogation of IRF-3 function enhanced virus-mediated injury by WEEV and the unrelated flavivirus St. Louis encephalitis virus. Furthermore, IRF-3-dependent neuronal protection from virus-mediated cytopathology occurred independently of autocrine or paracrine type I interferon activity. Despite being partially controlled by IRF-3-dependent signals, WEEV also disrupted antiviral responses by inhibiting pattern recognition receptor pathways. This antagonist activity was mapped to the WEEV capsid gene, which disrupted signal transduction downstream of IRF-3 activation and was independent of capsid-mediated inhibition of host macromolecular synthesis. Overall, these results indicate that innate immune pathways have important cytoprotective activity in neurons and contribute to limiting injury associated with infection by neurotropic arboviruses.",""

It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. Objectives We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. Study design During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. Results The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6). Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased during the late course of disease. Initial IP-10 levels during hospital days 1–4 were the most significantly correlated with initial viral load (r = 0.88, P < .01). Conclusion SFTS viremia persisted until weeks 2–3 and was highly correlated with initial plasma IP-10 levels. In addition, IFN-α, IL-10, and IP-10 were associated with the initial cytokine storm in SFTS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00435a61513e58bcc554c4abe3a5c808, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0277bdb0bc94e288394221691bf4915c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13401890036fb189b3b4092859ba90ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1340e9139d6410e86407a2e5935d4a66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15395657ed42029cb7458d40c281832f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ba2b88a5d4b33d33e45d28daeed216f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f11b465b2bb2f121ddb6595ad2e4d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2840c63bae5c512ed3b5cd6f795282ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28f7d58c78390b809d831cd31e60e6aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b344ab23fb0fbe458b4adfb00d69ce4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3765c7a784fd3c768eaf2eb2a235bfe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38923e969b021330fabed0c0d18ccc51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c752a8d5ad950e27659d4fee8a11424, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54f0a7c8c594b8bde6471f029c0bd9e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d2ac8668dd5bbe887ca84803e13bbfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64409ab152eba68ddeb64a9efd5001f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dd92e40c7ede590ea689a3b6b576c25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f53a99591559f6e1b26cc2752c76465, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8311a64cdf938e93df3e8f1d091ffd0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8887988dc337198cbbdc716389fb3508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c75b22912e61e0220a0aa58f9537f77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93b85270af7c917ba10d98467ec52c52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/951a007e5ae7a7e4b95d860958eab160, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9880153fde48ea2e6e3f36b452149366, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/996b09275d1d6c77e70f3446b8f4d2de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2099881cf3bc2c81c9d548ee9c1d1cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9a54aa127bfd4d825c5f879080dc2ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb0a1475eed38b8fd458c2b5ff8a20bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbe482ed79f01dfe77a1d896e8610b14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf1816e4a5a6d31cbf7391ceaa0d0acc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9362c9029c1ca9871d8c80f92680fa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfffe3dd2117d54684a9b5e516963187, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e61206f435e04b338a56cd31a6815a29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eaefa06b105c7237a5b679b3ed0275ad"

Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves ≤90 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy- and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen's κ = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between on-farm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement (κ = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement (κ = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04b28e10b8062e2f6ca823843a9d495d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05d6ac09a299382482e03a2c050b5dea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d6eb148cbbf8e5c83c4b16091fcea14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12f5086d01097b77d325be3071c8e2d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1907e0a91bafcbdef60c73ab36b1cf0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4afabc41f78bd9d40a528ced550472ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/508a8d75c0a3e39a605cf0184b5115f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/552966f86c7707e686517bb3354012b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dd9b3a343e08dc413ea3d5e34d3c9c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/680105edb502b8a3e2010bbe88056e09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d3294de4f2bb67ba125cc8a6ff2e387, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71b1e722aefe6ecd99b9558f44514ace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/856d4fae822acb23f323b645d5a3b9cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/874f197a85bbf969ed83469f95ce2d98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/898d0f85094b03c2356c48a4e036ba9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c482b5bea9b0eb4be44035d2de4f103, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a258e091745c0b779e86c9de89a1d8bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a52c070758927407ef3b1a72b67cf09d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6287181ac40bcd032df17ca8030fc9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6bbd9412b7018bea27c6a7ac58524c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7b0b8e553b44f85268272013e97175b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8fd9565c2c94e1ed92e0a42e01c4a50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c070643e4dfacf3bc62a6c6f8acaf746, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cada5c8663b37d702fecd2932495089b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db23bbcf37ebf08dfb16504b4a01bfb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e76a8f0d3f90ebef5be46756d75c3461, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa65bc332f4cc7af83535a615dffb20a"

In this review, we discuss the discovery, antiviral activity and mechanism of action of such peptides. While peptide entry inhibitors have been discovered by a wide variety of approaches (structure-based, accidental, intentional, rational and brute force) we show here that they share a common physical chemical property: they are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic and have a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. We propose that this propensity drives a shared mechanism of action for many peptide entry inhibitors, involving direct interactions with viral and cellular membranes, as well as interactions with the complex hydrophobic protein/lipid interfaces that are exposed, at least transiently, during virus–cell fusion. By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Based on this idea, we propose that an approach that focuses on the interfacial hydrophobicity of putative entry inhibitors could lead to the efficient discovery of novel, broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors.

They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present on exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of naïve T cells in vivo. These results suggest that exosomes containing M. tuberculosis antigens may be alternative approach to developing a tuberculosis vaccine.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0480bbc290638c537822405d1ca9cae8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/135bb1064796629be1e0c35393b66244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2960c4b41cc76fe244704463a272935e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3278051f81ac98a5b47576245214b555, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36b9cefaaf53cc6b557fbe626dce171e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/372b4fbe4ba3bbf11c9ecd2926581066, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3829d4b82becd3c6fb1a25fb0f889903, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d9ad624e481e8b933721a108f5a8f7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f687813afb9c0ebd0c86c84b0d953ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40db36b2e45270028d0eacb968170594, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/458478d3cf57ec63732c0ea4506cfc7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/529312fe8fae4e5ebff219a9829eac89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5319cfe97c33d9e721cb80e1ccc96e6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/551bbca041cd1aed6bd737a6c5c0908c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a9ead283f6c4d619642e540049b30e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5af0eb04962f8175cf66bb8334157295, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/652e744b27a684048948e6ac6e473f48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dbb3c5db0a7ae6228e2c92f48b521c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/754e83d5dd43556b842d802a8fa7d0b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a7081ea1bbd6f43ae41a30a2067af75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94e2fb029228dc2bb4ace6fa5b352a1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98a09a90635443ac8c460bb812dfcce5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f188bffbce09e672247489fd8c1c404, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4b88fef286ce4db3e9b16673dc088d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ff3628af9c7e79eac63bb75da689fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afcff313f7f94fb70bc1478ee8799f4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afd31dbd38830ab9362f7f311935802e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b713b417157ab57fab1aea6788badccf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba4d35e659fe36ef832b08a7526c0a77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf0cb50ecfb6b5768f17eb34c6801ecf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de686eec6e9be4142232d3ae2aa29ec4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0738ef3b7cf2f4e8c2e1419349cef43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f94ef5b569028bef76dcfc0f573406d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb2d35c5151bdba665590f8a39f9bcf9"

La cause de cette maladie reste inconnue mais différentes hypothèses ont été développées ces dernières années et s’associent à des travaux de recherche pour la compréhension de la physiopathologie de la MK. La présentation clinique de la MK partage de nombreux signes avec des maladies infectieuses virales et bactériennes. La possibilité d’une maladie infectieuse à superantigène a été suggérée. La fréquence augmentée dans certaines populations, la survenue précoce à l’âge pédiatrique supporte la participation de facteurs génétiques dans le développement de la maladie. Certaines anomalies immunologiques sont également retrouvées chez les sujets présentant une MK, suggérant qu’un déséquilibre immunologique est à l’origine de la vascularite. Abstract Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis, which occurs most commonly in infants and toddlers. It is self-limited but prognosis depends on the development of coronary abnormalities. The aetiology is unknown, but recent research has shed some light on its pathogenesis. Epidemiologic data and clinical presentation suggest that it might be a bacterial or viral infection, but attempts to demonstrate a specific pathogen have failed so far. The possibility that a superantigen-driven process might take place in this disorder has been advocated by several groups.

METHODOLOGY: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (β = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (β = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (β = 0.19 and β = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (β = −0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (β = −0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (β = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour. Risk communication should consider the effect of gender differences.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a353d289da49e0e59099fce10cb06cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43e714ecbc44be3d90ad2268a40b7859, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/619650cb4ad93766279983677c7ec1ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bd0acabb75a49827dc4a2b135291039, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c144cd91072d9aadcf7c80a55943df"

A number of volatile pheromones have been reported, but no MUP pheromones have been identified in rat urine. RESULTS: We used sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF), nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) after in gel digestion of the proteins and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and showed that the levels of two MUPs, odorant-binding protein 3 (OBP3) (i.e. PGCL4) and MUP13 (i.e. PGCL1), in urine and their mRNAs in liver were higher in males than in females and were suppressed by orchidectomy and restored by testosterone treatment (T treatment). We then generated recombinant MUPs (rMUPs) and found that the sexual attractiveness of urine from castrated males to females significantly increased after the addition of either recombinant OBP3 (rOBP3) or recombinant MUP13 (rMUP13). Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we further examined neuronal activation in the brains of female rats after they sniffed rOBP3 or rMUP13. Both rOBP3 and rMUP13 activated the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), medial preoptic area (MPA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), medial amygdala (MeA), posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), which participate in the neural circuits responsible for pheromone-induced sexual behaviours. In particular, more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos-ir) cells were observed in the posterior AOB than in the anterior AOB. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of OBP3 and MUP13 was male-biased and androgen-dependent. They attracted females and activated brain areas related to sexual behaviours in female rats, suggesting that both OBP3 and MUP13 are male pheromones in rats. Particularly, an OBP excreted into urine was exemplified to be a chemical signal.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0088aabd53a03a83627b862a296c648f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03ba23a5e84229b66ff68dba0306e9c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04a3370da3f26bd51892c9f4178970d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cb8a8c912937ac8f91aea00f40691cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/704dd46ee85c87f5a07a31b04935a46c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acd5762d578b0aa1e850ef9de440bdb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c515dd6d5c328f8ba56263e60f3c544e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cea2698f9af057164d44c52491c71bac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d005034535d4567e290aaf47c5962fdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbc75a11ac0204119ca4c8ac6306ab96"

Previous work to assess immune function has relied upon relatively crude measures of immunocompetence. However, with next-generation RNA-sequencing, it is now possible to create a profile of gene expression in response to an immune challenge. In this study, captive zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata; adult males) were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle to stimulate the innate immune system. 2 hours after injection, birds were euthanized and hypothalami, spleen, and red blood cells (RBCs) were collected. Taking advantage of the fully sequenced genome of zebra finch, total RNA was isolated, sequenced, and partially annotated in these tissue/cells. RESULTS: In hypothalamus, there were 707 significantly upregulated transcripts, as well as 564 and 144 in the spleen and RBCs, respectively, relative to controls. Also, 155 transcripts in the hypothalamus, 606 in the spleen, and 61 in the RBCs were significantly downregulated. More specifically, a number of immunity-related transcripts (e.g., IL-1β, RSAD2, SOCS3) were upregulated among tissues/cells. Additionally, transcripts involved in metabolic processes (APOD, LRAT, RBP4) were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential trade-off in expression of genes that regulate immunity and metabolism in birds challenged with LPS. This finding is consistent with a hypothermic response to LPS treatment in small birds. Unlike mammals, birds have nucleated RBCs, and these results support a novel transcriptomic response of avian RBCs to immune challenge.

However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15b3d7958dfdba688d1c6baefa5ee317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bcc3ee2680e04b0c5b28b0608b94c9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78ac6ff24dc2677192b52d517b765b59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8069782115219a0583a7cc08db835b12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a88e6dd3ce0d9fcd24e064d9630ebef1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5c17a9b8c2f49cc18be753fe5312428"

Studies show the adaptive response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is ineffective for complete viral elimination. Other studies describe the kinetics of the adaptive response to PRRSV, but have not investigated the early response by DCs. We hypothesize that there is an aberrant activation of DCs early in PRRSV infection; consequently, the adaptive response is triggered inadequately. The current study characterized a subtype of porcine lung DCs (L-DCs) and investigated the ability of PRRSV to infect and replicate in L-DCs and monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs). Furthermore, the type I interferon anti-viral response to PRRSV with and without the addition of recombinant porcine IFN-α (rpIFN-α), an important cytokine that signals for anti-viral mediator activation, was analysed. Results show that PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, providing evidence that these cells have followed distinct differentiation pathways. Although both cell types responded to PRRSV with an induction of IFN-β mRNA, the magnitude and duration of the response differed between cell types. The addition of rpIFN-α was protective in MDDCs, and mRNA synthesis of Mx (myxovirus resistant) and PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase) was observed in both cell types after rpIFN-α addition. Overall, PRRSV replicated in MDDCs but not L-DCs, and rpIFN-α was required for the transcription of protective anti-viral mediators. DC response to PRRSV was limited to IFN-β transcription, which may be inadequate in triggering the adaptive immune response.",""

For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 has been shown to be able to bind in vitro to the negative strand of the intergenic sequence, a cis-acting element found in the leader RNA and preceding each downstream ORF in the genome. hnRNP A1 thus has been proposed as a host factor in MHV transcription. To test this hypothesis genetically, we initially constructed MHV mutants with a very high-affinity hnRNP A1 binding site inserted in place of, or adjacent to, an intergenic sequence in the MHV genome. This inserted hnRNP A1 binding site was not able to functionally replace, or enhance transcription from, the intergenic sequence. This finding led us to test more directly the role of hnRNP A1 by analysis of MHV replication and RNA synthesis in a murine cell line that does not express this protein. The cellular absence of hnRNP A1 had no detectable effect on the production of infectious virus, the synthesis of genomic RNA, or the quantity or quality of subgenomic mRNAs. These results strongly suggest that hnRNP A1 is not a required host factor for MHV discontinuous transcription or genome replication.",""

To address this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated that express the nucleoprotein or glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as self in oligodendrocytes. Intraperitoneal infection with LCMV strain Armstrong led to infection of tissues in the periphery but not the CNS, and the virus was cleared within 7–14 d. After clearance, a chronic inflammation of the CNS resulted, accompanied by upregulation of CNS expression of MHC class I and II molecules. A second LCMV infection led to enhanced CNS pathology, characterized by loss of myelin and clinical motor dysfunction. Disease enhancement also occurred after a second infection with unrelated viruses that cross-activated LCMV-specific memory T cells. These findings indicate that chronic CNS autoimmune disease may be induced by infection with a virus sharing epitopes with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and this disease may be enhanced by a second infection with the same or an unrelated virus. These results may explain the association of several different viruses with some human autoimmune diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03ed8243ed3bb2c47756640f554c2224, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06758e647c187df3493b4b63749ec41d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09b183cd21152554f1d666f44806e983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e10a14cc535ae6424143aa4fb4809eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ed1482bc8730daf3215a62b0675b8b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15a4d37515022ccf00a02614768f139b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/179f85f35f5149b5c2af3b41219701e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17ed9c1c8dc639ce390efee57ebb2364, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1949cc80a71352e535fa1adbe57484cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/200db1a122b06ac147e9db9e0fb8bb8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2039c47490204ca039ebc3727c71cde6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2138558408cbb62095b66ca3b63e6f2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d187df183a69f3b342c02819572737d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42474df7d736a52b55e981138533dcaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43e6885c4173c08917d790b4ac670d90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49842dca4f3c21a281a38bef981d6f8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c46e15437f34a5ab9d24e68eca66aac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53afb3d411be1b6fa6ea0c8ac51fa8c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/549756ae482da749812629e3d291fbd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c6d2ac6c269ab794531f0b7499b4138, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f2cf4107b7b6a7cb30642acaa52c51b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/693adc1622c1989cdccb7b2fdfeaf2f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cf8e6d5d83aa5133da8380b44b8ef05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/731b1295cd5f67009ff1d10b20aeeb9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73640b93f7bfc9d6cf39bf62493d82d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/873b570c9d19b98add9e7614e4d93533, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/892896a36bdbaa923fe41b0e62d51405, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/902b52b2723eba5a5a3d3e0a0e4828ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/989d8346373b122c91d197d2145a7718, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99ef29aa3618b58c7ff92795a1fd79e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e2aa34a2edc0a35e740acae4626b6d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3cf758ce3da0a99cd8f2acd246b8c48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a827bd159e353a646124832e8dcfd192, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9ed4b94eeec22f28461bfdee76d3f98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad0b295373c741288f7be33d5a718396, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aea10885c7dbac4ed9e1fc3c56f46840, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b071c8d0c28577553ce381888ed027f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4f317f33416cafcbc70a2eddc56e308, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be498823ff9b335b83f98f211aa28c22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf8f7497dc06cf8c217d5d360587bdf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c28ac2c9e1357bcfa6e973e8b2f73d32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6ac8911abda6a27c87e22d7374498ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce25d5154e0cbb7e67121ee681aa169f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfc6a8e66bca5c1def5cabb7a9b8d70f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d08f94e16c0845ca13cf2b3b5e9243ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e23c7d95bfd0908260950b09ae6763c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e44bfd237ff73de73624b48a03267c64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e55adf7b1e3159323afa819bbbb0eea3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec2c9fdd4c3e6833574b50555c92d8ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee2ac41a15474182eba4e0171d48b2a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef2c323516605d375964585468def234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3ad97f4775064bf21ce95e514f1956c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe1cf1e760c7ec23d6bfdb4bb0fe905c"

In humans, CPS-CQ is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to CQ. Chloroquine, an established anti-malarial drug, is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of CQ during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in Plasmodium berghei models. METHODS: A number of experiments in selected complimentary P. berghei murine models in Balb/cByJ and C57BL/6j mice was performed. First, the effect of CQ administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by RAS immunization was studied. Next, the effect of CQ on the induction of circumsporozoite (CS) protein-specific CD8(+) T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites expressing a mutant CS protein was investigated. Finally, a direct comparison of CPS-CQ to CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects, was performed. RESULTS: When CQ was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of RAS, this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory CD8(+) T cells or CS protein-specific CD8(+) T cells. Also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered. Replacement of CQ by MQ for CPS immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of IFNγ producing memory T cells in the liver (p = 0.01), but similar protection. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of CQ on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in P. berghei malaria models. Alternatively, the higher efficiency of CPS compared to RAS might be explained by an indirect effect of CQ through limiting blood-stage exposure after immunization or to increased antigen exposure and, therefore, improved breadth of the immune response.

Rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of naïve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies. Although full protection of pups was not achieved in this mouse model, our observations are important for the development of improved vaccines against RV in humans as well as in various animal species.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/070e3ed02aaed5d290194291cf729fe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0960e12c400ed2e83483c7262d2f8a5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b0fad62c747e1934ca589a28cc06768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/196b3398348b12283b0949c9e2c32bed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a44c1a602e1e53e5f0bcf6b149cb710, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296df899bb948aec7764aebca7a2f82d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c95048a2a687a12a790d7fdfbbdfdd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fc82f841243b4bb63df59b664cbea6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/347ee65669cc1c974fd1ededb0ce0599, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39e0a6f68c5fd64b7247d37d1dbc4223, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45e1ec370407623a4ea9516e6925ed14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e9d975075f2af970455e375239560ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63b896ff835ac3a3eb762b98f7ceda29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67b8cfc4e776fa6648f18531e379a47b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7606f4552ee0a9c700f792e9af18f50a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7953d3c2c6a458f64672b3a6cd228996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c466ec7edb42f4e64e7a09b26b3f1a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d42e4988957123fd43db0d75c0b5ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84615a10f6479dc9790089f97e887809, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89ec073729424efabb63cd8d21a62a38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/902ecc936fcddcbe1b3ec797a7eb7a45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd5f96d80430e7f47ea05951e3818ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abfdec172ec69aee4f3ab5fdeeaa5d1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b17720287c6ff58a5531b5821873b10c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b31328d5d26655aa48d786c9cf475dd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be40b5d5ad14f4706514d2d5f830a6fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c12d4bd7b62d616567e8018234edcc08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf4b79d2e7b25d5654586978bdb63f21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d35e6235fc89155350a50e831f2a7f0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5bf743bd7301f67828dfa96553942d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5d432b16b01dd3321beed5948215e8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb6739440966bcf652a9a4808181dea3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fed5cac0a719813d0962e28e7bc36bdf"

In this context, we hypothesized that transfecting alveolar type II epithelial cells with CCR3-targeted siRNA or antisense (AS-ODN) sequences will downregulate cellular synthesis and release of the primary CCR3 ligands CCL26 and CCL24 and will modulate other CCR3 ligands. The human A549 alveolar type II epithelium-like cell culture model was used for transfection and subsequent effects on CCR3 agonists. siRNAs were particularly effective. PCR showed a 60-80% decrease in mRNA and immunoblots showed up to 75-84% reduction of CCR3 in siRNA treated cells. CCR3-siRNA treatments reduced IL-4 stimulated CCL26 release and constitutive CCL24 release by 65% and 80%, respectively. Release of four additional CCR3 agonists RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3 and MCP-4 was also significantly reduced by CCR3-siRNA treatments of the alveolar type II cells. Activation of eosinophils, assessed as superoxide anion generation, was reduced when eosinophils were treated with supernatants of A549 cells pretreated with CCR3-targeted siRNAs or AS-ODNs. Collectively, the data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of CCR3 receptors may be a potential therapeutic approach for interrupting proinflammatory signaling.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02b5d64c0229ad9c1f6faffc5e2beade, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02fa3c7f7f858a591fc8bff904cb40f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0623d4dc8fe6a8a05fa5cace5bab38e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0631a745408f4b73b0d5dba16f0a918d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/067ed7a3b10ef320a1427bc145d679b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c1458f60032033464a9d2b7ee555790, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cd5462cdce33ef8436dbc8d838c13f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eb6828590278ce93e30ea4874f0bcf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f0c1024b7bdbc80d64430b35c41edca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2190f3f6f9faf5732334eb5baba86146, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/300e6e3e5dc740cc5e21b1da235bce71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31238a3e9618f476ccce0929d60f7f18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37b7f6cd05cb0db9fc5e41b22b355df8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/385d2a610eb09fd7ba5fee7afe884bf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4364af2a91cd7b1e74b051eceb5dc8dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46a6bfa54b13aacf7095b098ed8d3ce9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5025bf15f94d8d4f33dd9981f00c918c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d25276ef497dc9f703f15f65b35e680, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6be717c568ec2010b18385c28dc0bbad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f84bcc7d183b4e47d9ab5ab5f9e2a46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72e6f54aeb2adf2c4ae5027454329710, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74247902560aefa874a5201f92b8346f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/747f064d7e66e55113eb745604613703, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b0802c2328bf2d47454b6b68b0389db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/802c8468c357371f8ba33af4d895f3f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83267480c47dce5897e6ba3e9e704986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/844fb09747a624691840991a9d976132, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929df124617ead8424fd46280b89da5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/996e6ac27449f6a905b016487c986979, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a06713aeb4cf1ed314d03ba27b05c77d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a27473f4f055d5726b29300bc5f691d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2fb5abc27bda633061524d99b621e39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a338e945eeba20bbce4f7c8c0a906a34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a48d85aac1f99247d1057679e012ad50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b128f89a732788338c728ef41d268cdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2a74f5793be3900d075d47806e2faa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4958bf4bc80914d65e224c337fb3646, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5ffe05c70e25c688f4d748e023263a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cded69e4e76085cdf1883a0493c06ab8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da288693420b70967f23f386e1ef3d18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6710d456e02745768bbdeb78079547f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e78601fc7287634299598e8674250c1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ead4845bcb701b5d16f31f6cd0e64064, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f75103bf46e3508cb97e58b7d64c0e84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9e425f6502c487346dd7aaecd92f7e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc2b852e4d60e66ccd1eb0dc43c22487, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fca21f344369f1989578d5d81183d5a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd5264a1b45fac8da9b7101acfe615b3"

It was originally thought that viral peptides are liberated during constitutive protein turnover, but this conflicts with the observation that viral epitopes are detected within minutes of their synthesis even when their source proteins exhibit half-lives of days. The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products. One potential source of DRiPs is premature translation termination. If this is a major source of DRiPs, this should be reflected in positional bias towards the N-terminus. By contrast, if downstream initiation is a major source of DRiPs, there should be positional bias towards the C-terminus. Here, we systematically assessed positional bias of epitopes in viral antigens, exploiting the large set of data available in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We show a statistically significant degree of positional skewing among epitopes; epitopes from both ends of antigens tend to be under-represented. Centric-skewing correlates with a bias towards class I binding peptides being over-represented in the middle, in parallel with a higher degree of evolutionary conservation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fedd6df52a738ee501b8068d4675051, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16ee2a34a1825a7d6338fd62b648d07b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1846736da05a194fea8e9909e6652b55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e1dc794d4e476b703195b943ad50411, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f8dac585da84ce6ffaf13f721723ee0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21b709f2a8adc5a3850cdef2fca3865a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69ab19187d51e93eba4dc61953d1308e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6eeca496f8b3ea637f7427598714e91d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f53af34c9c9a1a58df9d50138fece44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a0ae02061e83ad5d2cfdbf679745187, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dbefabca1d1f15a2f8b9a5adb686d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f251a2b3cf106b6cbb9c251f8653ab3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/978d3cdf2325b82dde015f5cc47f4405, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aa1b9d59aee6f436bb9597c048912b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d28eeefbbaacd6a86d8be876eb24ecb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af918ae079329e69991df6218cb04622, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be926b720fd4d567f07c34c3b2a0ea70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2758005e1deed27be1616a942d9075e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9de4858e428670b14da0e57a51d219b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd9eb29f0d65949edc64d879c67dc869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbe0b12dcfdbc573e2c37b13cd1a341d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e69d5cd239584bcf531a90162c94087a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f15c9c1baefa34707a79f1f54ff98a53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6c67fe17f6b738296eef0c7ac1b15f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdc766be7c8abd4a16ce05693d63c4e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/feb7c2a4fe85c3e4b7fbce98e0a2c74e"

Ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) of negative strand RNA viruses are a prime example where repetition of nucleoprotein (NP) along the genome creates a core polymeric helical scaffold that accommodates other nucleocapsid proteins including viral polymerase. The RNCs are transported through the cytosol for packaging into virions through association with viral matrix proteins at cell membranes. We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging. Previously, we had generated single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) against Filoviruses that have all targeted highly conserved C-terminal regions of NP known to be repetitively exposed along the length of the RNCs of Marburgvirus (MARV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV). Our crosslinker design consisted of dimeric sdAb expressed intracellularly, which we call Xintrabodies (X- for crosslinking). Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers incubated with purified sdAb constructs showed NP aggregation occurred in a genus-specific manner with dimeric and not monomeric sdAb. A virus-like particle (VLP) assay was used for initial evaluation where we found that dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation into VP40-based VLPs whereas monomeric sdAb did not. Inhibition of NP packaging was genus specific. Confocal microscopy revealed dimeric sdAb was diffuse when expressed alone but focused on pools of NP when the two were coexpressed, while monomeric sdAb showed ambivalent partition. Infection of stable Vero cell lines expressing dimeric sdAb specific for either MARV or EBOV NP resulted in smaller plaques and reduced progeny of cognate virus relative to wild-type Vero cells. Though the impact was marginal at later time-points, the collective data suggest that viral replication can be reduced by crosslinking intracellular NP using relatively small amounts of dimeric sdAb to restrict NP packaging. The stoichiometry and ease of application of the approach would likely benefit from transitioning away from intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb to exogenous delivery of antibody. By retuning sdAb specificity, the approach of crosslinking highly conserved regions of assembly critical proteins may well be applicable to inhibiting replication processes of a broad spectrum of viruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0946702ff96e4b964c5c26d150bad1f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f727076e13fd6bd4ef482f01ecb28b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a42b8f19fbaeb1f80c15981d1ebc4d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1afdf821baea43a702abc0ab258f471f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ff4bfb6f44142aaf26a8f09ff9e5c7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26d4bd9f0adb644521d99b08d1c8cec9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cc19af4d74d94782595262e62f43aed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31578bddae77102bc7b546cb631cd3ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3511ea5827fe855cb261945834e0a4c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/353ceb85716d962a91ed779e6c0c3084, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41ef72c570bad0c16f50fbed8ff4f548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f60d628ea9a54ae0025f3b3ebb517fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59743f8513b4d3c0f0943c1f21088fea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/598e438ad8ea4acf423589b2f73426f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63c7d76efbf134816ea087363e7c5f59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63ed73480c00f0fc31fc18fbbe457d8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68561377c0e557a8f94cab6e35f7f58e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c112fa00cb0ac1e1a22b31d3ab5b74f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cf75b6d8f72a38258bb73efec67991e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d773c7e50766f210b8f4ba12da21a95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ed085705724ba57523c97f19dede418, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fc2ab06085762a94845b75bff877cdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73ead8d9e4af6d196dc5ceb8b509105e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bfdda3042b9b2a177ca57e5d60a7d4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8221431a40f1def229eb83ec9dfe1954, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ad0eb253f7f3b9850495f7440190552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b991f0ea1187e688039d39818638cdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bad4c95426a14b3a7eb7b7c5d0280d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cc4eeac16e89ace9839743926d963a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b8f6dad8ee30da7d6323c8e9b1f846f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9db0251cdc7cd23aa06c21464344a9da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4b3f53851d813c18c792cee42afdcf7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5f7a70e6ce000d7276fa446fb75cb5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a91682d2e4cc8b9faf0a13409df704ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac5151ad5541782c73d8b9e53beb9259, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aef6d7d899bcdcbc221ed1c18096ccf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af6882ae8b9d99ddebebf703958397c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0edf289fa256fb4e74ab2f645a21222, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b201786db8e6469f52aae112f338843f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3b42fd719d02dc736bba73dcb8ffeee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3b9f40d5274b7f28357ad9620f47f67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc3687163b7e7951b308439cc27fd908, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bde785722b26ae64f5b6ce9d41300c34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c13efa33414c847020c4f0d104292ec9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c166574ede9a111d5225ef70fbbd0a15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4a0d33ae6bdc7e8d4e39e82c5ccea86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4cf37230a3b047730b0ddd99d3bc5b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5b99fe1302f7acd2773f2f490fe6fb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6660791aadb8599a0754ba16ad21c54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cca13f13919f7954142f2a6d6dfa822c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db6349ca8ac1683e652e8b710f839d30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2d4554641ea3ac69ad6056927e2f3db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2f80fe1a25f557b7d181c646f847a95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e34bd6336fec0c8a68d082bf59334816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7464937339fbfcb308b14aada39cd0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edc53fe4c6db54fa297cdf8f4e360e09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1ad2d9ca861ed53734b6039c0fc4275, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9deaa0774b194cef81b6a9e3debaf13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb5c8c08eb6e0753f639f00d4f087614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fccff7330dc413ec4b89baf2d4446b59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fddb79345289be83ce50877176a4fcb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff7d8fbe8cc0dc6291aa3ad8084c9b2f"

This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I, n = 6, and III, n = 15) and 3-day-old (in exp. II, n = 9) KO and wild-type (WT, same ages in respective exps.) piglets were inoculated with TCID(50) 1x10(3) PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow’s colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals either deceased or euthanized were necropsied and intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05112fb7c0539cd395197b9cd3242a2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06a8e062e46b9fe604d9415a567aa27a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/072a9d198c31a8c2b63ed4e24b14ccca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c0057c2138ddd33ff4bd6d2a743ed68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ce38a5f2642c3ba950aa49a4c7b4c76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e82a29d9397910d445911c28f00e40a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aa979c4ebb394619a5fdf9cc7ffe5d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aea5cc1ce5fa09423f4c9b4823caf37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f3fba5509baca7199a1cbf35d197fbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23821321f55dfcce24dc907b226ac54e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296f482e76060ebb264e43466f4c0957, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34d09e92bc4441b3d5c56c2de5a6e449, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39eeef65c9190eaec8b11c32c632ef11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a4a06ff707e9e41f0a42fcccf1ae4bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ae5a56255578c175195bfb24e76e35b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/437461137125abad032a041863728bfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43d98c83386bbe1b35ef560de57ec3c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fdc75f4819b9fa874495acf831e3394, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5412dc3ed1de1586fdc5eea32f15cd6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5665dc2aaeca4d2f1a92556a39e6c549, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f8b880e223df60482cdb42193c1d05a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6394350991f83213d04fe88d863edecf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65cb6e4ed2d0ee6fc83c59d3e59df7a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/669f50a21976aa9f423fd3c9928b02e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74a013f23da7f0c770b0959e18e4a9c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f379b7a1883fb5fea63f8e396da517, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/803fdc4d30f31178dd1b33141e7298ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eb923f7fd8a914c09bdf8b3061dd3d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91b7bd2eb0e4c253d08b934ff3855719, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f7ade8e1566b867a5ee02472a9a6ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c3947171097d1e46b7189be1acc3f49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1bc99ead563293b5847db4c34d55403, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4c797a7db315ac0c475babf2a7e5fa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9e98ae0c0480b0451b5879e51db7568, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aecf7d4b6579f7c3c5637831fe5f3f40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af61361570cf439e8ef95873d3214db2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0d419b363c867091cfdb74752632db5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5f69bb96ea60d190f156ee7fade0653, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0b61450ce6692e14f190ad408a090a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0cc3b8418b261aeeaa1837da3ce495a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e63c85229f7c801b8359a7d5bfa0cc51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6499fee8952fb7fba66eb4c13191457, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed27f894adbbd02e6ed23d1770aa6945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f409393c4422d8ecbf8de5497fc9d773"

However, the increased hematocrit induced by EPO-driven marrow stimulation greatly limits its potential for side effect-free therapy. We created a library of EPO-derived fragments based on the hypothesis that 2 distinct functions, erythropoiesis and tissue protection, reside in different regions of the molecule. Several small EPO-derived peptides within the Aβ loop of whole EPO molecule were screened for tissue protection in EAE mice. The 19-mer JM-4 peptide that contains 2 cysteine molecules consistently demonstrated the most potent clinical beneficial effects without producing hematocrit alterations in animal models of EAE. The JM-4-induced tissue protection was associated with modulation of the immunoregulatory process that drives inflammation and provokes subsequent autoimmune damage. Like the whole EPO molecule, JM-4 effectively modulated immune/inflammatory reaction within both the peripheral lymphatic tissue and central nervous system. The major effects induced by JM-4 include blocked expansion of monocyte/dendritic antigen presenting cell and T helper 17 cell populations, decreased proinflammatory cytokine production, and sharply enhanced expansion of the regulatory T-cell population. JM-4 shows promise for treatment of a broad spectrum of neural and non-neural conditions associated with inflammation.

Oligomeric HIV-1 envelope proteins delivered with a potent adjuvant are expected to elicit strong antibody responses with broad neutralization specificity. To test this hypothesis, two SIV envelope proteins were formulated with delta inulin-based adjuvant (Advax) and used to immunize nonhuman primates. Oligomeric gp140–gp145 from SIVmac251 and SIVsmE660 was purified to homogeneity. Oligomers showed high-affinity interaction with CD4 and were highly immunogenic in rabbits, inducing Tier 2 SIV-neutralizing antibodies. The immunogenicity of an oligomeric Env DNA prime and protein boost together with Advax was evaluated in Chinese rhesus macaques. DNA administration elicited antibodies to both envelopes, and titres were markedly enhanced following homologous protein boosts via intranasal and intramuscular routes. Strong antibody responses were detected against the V1 and V2 domains of gp120. During peak immune responses, a low to moderate level of neutralizing activity was detected against Tier 1A/1B SIV isolates, with a moderate level noted against a Tier 2 isolate. Increased serum antibody affinity to SIVmac251 gp140 and generation of Env-specific memory B cells were observed in the immunized macaques. Animals were subjected to low-dose intravaginal challenge with SIVmac251 one week after the last protein boost. One out of three immunized animals was protected from infection. Although performed with a small number of macaques, this study demonstrates the utility of oligomeric envelopes formulated with Advax in eliciting broad antibody responses with the potential to provide protection against SIV transmission.",""

Work was carried out in 22 sheep farms, with (i) flock size over 150 animals, (ii) presence of clinical signs of diarrhoea in lambs in the flock and (iii) close and continuous contact and movement of shepherd dogs within the animal shed of each farm. Faecal sample collection from lambs was performed within 48h of onset of clinical signs and prior to administration of any antimicrobial or antiparasitic medication to lambs. Faecal samples were also collected from puppies in the farm. In total, samples were collected from 126 lambs and 58 puppies. Samples were processed by using established techniques for isolation of bacteria, detection of viruses and observation of protozoan oocycts. Escherichia coli isolates obtained during the study, were tested for antimicrobial resistance against a variety of antimicrobial agents. In total, 236 bacterial isolates were recovered from faecal samples of lambs and 165 isolates from faecal samples of puppies. E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism: 104 isolates from lambs and 109 isolates from puppies were recovered. Other bacteria isolated were Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., (lambs and puppies), Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter freundi, Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae (only lambs) and Streptococcus spp. (only puppies). Group A Rotavirus was detected in samples from lambs (2.5%) and Parvovirus in samples from puppies (5%). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in samples from lambs and puppies. This is the first report of isolation of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and of detection of Rotavirus from lambs in Greece. Rates of E. coli isolates from puppies resistant to antimicrobial agents were, in general, smaller than respective rates in isolates from lambs. Two pairs of isolates from the same farm (one from a lamb and one from a puppy) with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected, which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0896bd041bffdb9005abce427ac7f5ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d9dc0953183043c595e7efdd6fd486c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/257c10a7fd8de64a2ca96676a944e66d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34690b37eb3e228e7cabdfc73ce0ca0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34797597eccbacf845482ec56e9e1d97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/358f6d18f5530a1a0df5323e8f0024b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42abb201e213a122cd02e3f82df44f2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4485c98bd0093ed1813c4904224521fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4da88de1f1fd0554d72d67efac52ea96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/511cf419d8ccd550800a2e5c8c14848a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d904fa49beb862c0cd183ba7b3ba642, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f98c3dad3f71f8c7996be0413e18636, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f9e855d59e296d539dc417b206f4a1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/632403f1eabc4327f64b8747cce0f8dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6328109e8e1b5e65c0774c93b313eb7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b0ef1f1600225e7493152b5f9a701ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e98ab9a277ce55569e2073cec158e4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71bb03dd354c0b10edf2dadffb4ce0ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/767a8a057c2e97f85a77247530f09e22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80e75e826a5c8207c524e66561b06581, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/819ca90cfb5cd6e3fe30447db8234006, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/892f74229585bef6f2519977949548a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f9f0957bb4fbb397d7c2ec7f7844df1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/977d1b68a7ac882e443c24c3180bcbe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/995383d8899527762e61166784a41127, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99bb5e820f703f87271273aa8030528d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f5c4342046868ed16ce54892047a6ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4aaa4965ec4484ac21ceebddf931e03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ec203e33ba61cb5052d9880c6eff67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a872fa22a83ed006bcb00f40a6aa1b6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/accc64109e733e48cf499b6f8ef7708f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2113c23540e3e9319bf4e8735a63708, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b46248ed7eb38ceb0639d91d6e249526, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c00869fee02b05fa03c3b93bd2761dfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1a0ffcd4c4ccd219cd8fd3ddd00003b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c550fd7cdc239897ba7e26ed6a99c89d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d911feb1dbeeb89dccd1688b142af793, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de40b23550ecdddf3bb9c80d1a7550b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2665e52983a61af8bebd4a543759749, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2f1d6c4eb09cff61f38af200e1f00dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f02d5db83591a5a5d1e2d0777883590a"

RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg2+ significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/091edbd322665e805340c9f996fd7061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a6ca12fc4f14117ca801f29b8449eca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/157cade5753d3cee552c19c0d228b59d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/179bf823f1a1be4121c10bc656f15872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21e19b24a473096e17f67f2e0ebacc23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f0ea31e7851657b38091b06a4e74f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29d2e5f7df83d9a7857baa3cf3ef10a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a135526bd3838c984dec5d20bb4712b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34cdf699faba576bec51a95c981a6aa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/410f43ef6c466298fa17bcc5401e2789, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42ff08a7529ca111cc892710e036b4e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43be50884a8e0348434e0935b37d52b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5537543da18349b4bd7ce7f9923b6c4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/567c87919d92788e459b54f9a5395d3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59ca82f62fdebde050d931c31269710c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c14acd35433b16ba94b7f86da0e6429, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61803a1ba2dfde88c0789dc7b7fe3789, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/647c44aa7dbb386e149074c40d24dab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6588db6a1215f04389c9cc34f5af050c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75ca0a6fde57d75465eafadf9ca170b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8260bc0467117936c41f35ad88bb3ab2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87cd1d5eedac281345d8d6ea13df7f70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92e94eac36fdcb037f0fc1a62a50e998, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0a3562e9502da595038f824fee5ec8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a974d9a2b341e2aa7f55573c2d264bf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b07b340838435070be1ae750d15b814e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c88234ae02570c35df5545e0602febe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf9914f13d8311d7602e0b25530378ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d51236f2f18b96d6f8efc54af1d3dc6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e54aa412edb36d201dbde32d86586629, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eaea99bfb2d36029a42a1da6743b548b"

Recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for IBV. Therefore we hypothesized that early IBV vaccination will generate an immature, poorly protective IBV-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of IBV. To test this hypothesis the IBV-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages. This demonstrated a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the 1, 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower IgA antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group. Similar observations were made for antibodies in tears. In addition, IgG antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds. The delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower IgG avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV field strain challenge. The lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group, while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected. These data strongly support IBV vaccination after day 7 post hatch.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c064eb629f8e6af0db6704c00543696, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d9e1865480f13990c089954fdf49225, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/113d0d2881ad90d9ba899e113d8e2642, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12167215f9d51fa669e5077d4e71a6da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13941d5c2d76f2d789008fc59f2f9d7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19c55b144bca78724738d28a497a68c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b5bb1a177a2cf0eb29fd03d0d747283, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40321f48a57b98107895b59fe565953e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44ad51ad81120f2fb85a6dd8db36e2b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c5041f1bf3744ff30baf6b87211a891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ce9bf02e3b4c825b9995c13c8197952, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/566b1f41fda1e5fbac3711db0cbbf7c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6890db3025e32c10bcc9265d735920dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bd9d86d5f67a47d179695e81b2058f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7017f23ee3b11e460a031050a0e51743, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b88e9ca7270e2dc1d9a7928ccb69891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b97b8596ddb8dd8a0f7b122d3e661a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e1b42e9932c16533a9d20cc1efd7167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c55fcd7d916e6e4e13a3b2e688dfc60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97aba39cc21456753ba54758d42c55a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f17d0cdfd959241db7321feb5bcf736, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5f7377cfa1defb50f41e8e9b40e560f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8568e41d7e2c198b41e7f41f3d10065, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9a3ae55a225c3aee6a71f37f96adf5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2b623a25cc82eb5b9e9dad8595fa857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2d79e0422f1d943091580ba5e35d7c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7e1a15da8ef24d10056eaf139a08645, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c04c3c6000d8a7be02339518eac2c79f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e322057097ae43ea786350cff4336d9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3434b89260dc938d2c900079ee51564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebd50c89c34695fdc65e615deb729570, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4d0e2a73e00b97d785499a81c5b934f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f2ceef0f5111572233050f637ddcd1"

The main aim was to develop a reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of PRRSV-induced multifactorial respiratory disease. The central hypothesis was that respiratory disease results from an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. In a first series of studies, PRRSV was shown to be a poor inducer of TNF-α and IFN-α in the lungs, whereas IL-1 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were produced consistently during infection. We then set up a dual inoculation model in which pigs were inoculated intratracheally with PRRSV and 3–14 days later with LPS. PRRSV-infected pigs developed acute respiratory signs for 12–24h upon intratracheal LPS inoculation, in contrast to pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. Moreover, peak TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 titers were 10–100 times higher in PRRSV–LPS inoculated pigs than in the singly inoculated pigs and the cytokine overproduction was associated with disease. To further prove the role of proinflammatory cytokines, we studied the effect of pentoxifylline, a known inhibitor of TNF-α and IL-1, on PRRSV–LPS induced cytokine production and disease. The clinical effects of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), meloxicam and flunixin meglumine, were also examined. Pentoxifylline, but not the NSAIDs, significantly reduced fever and respiratory signs from 2 to 6h after LPS. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1 in the lungs of pentoxifylline-treated pigs were moderately reduced, but were still 26 and 3.5-fold higher than in pigs inoculated with PRRSV or LPS only. This indicates that pathways other than inhibition of cytokine production contributed to the clinical improvement. Finally, we studied a mechanism by which PRRSV may sensitize the lungs for LPS. We hypothesized that PRRSV would increase the amount of LPS receptor complex in the lungs leading to LPS sensitisation. Both CD14 and LPS-binding protein, two components of this complex, increased significantly during infection and the amount of CD14 in particular was correlated with LPS sensitisation. The increase of CD14 was mainly due to infiltration of strongly CD14-positive monocytes in the lungs. The PRRSV–LPS combination proved to be a simple and reproducible experimental model for multifactorial respiratory disease in pigs. To what extent the interaction between PRRSV and LPS contributes to the development of complex respiratory disease is still a matter of debate.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/139f73e256a14507d05fe94465a81f3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1555291da042eaaee0555983d15486ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/164ddd0b783d720d9441b000b38f8f1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16dbaf9139f74e90193f4480246fab2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/183fc966c57ffa2dc7106fb23d873a7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b3d5ad908b5b630de465ddbbed34612, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d1cd5e17bb504238190c0557dd77a18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dc18c46e8152d02e94a83dbeef7f46d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fb08d07ea47329bb30070b02b51f661, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/243cb4c58d4664080fd5643120285a49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/262a344f5b6a8bb5bdb85b808387f63b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268e2eb5a312b6e733ace56f01391865, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dbbb5f2e22a17e03e70ff9804c33c32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fa2dc9e9c7ba8c828d4cdefb6a0ed7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/319f51f4aafc78e508fc9f8221352e76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31e19afb89b3f79d67b4baac7a85af30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38ce244dcb7f9fc3c07225fd793cf521, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/390a06d7ab0fc96ebda9b417f49c3569, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/403b0c093754d1cd49ab44aef9fa270f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/470ba89d9fe748e45ac79285f30cd9c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4deee1f0eb0ee80a98f6063290811130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53da5a20e3b7287370b71659fcc5765e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63046016823ad9543248819721d606cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/685098fd97a1921bbeb3d0f6099a25a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fc9720b548f528bb400fe28ee28bfd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75b1f154e75ea695fd382cea223032a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7658d45b2de0a55f4df16dd0dfeac6fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a2eba4f09562a4aa35e101ab7f4aefc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8285ad6a458391cb952f3fd2860d18e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/843429ab546285b10146958459b93777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/940076c558855b992af4aacb7d99e1e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99469c54d4ddb929ea60b1cc5333162c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a48dfc25cb9afa30b172db257834e7a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b043dc99609b5e5efff22c30000c0015, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1fce6726581b7b50491b2c5a69e4afa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b52a690af4ceccff715cff82fdd7415f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b82f7f6abbc827caa959cb2995cfbc3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba1c451935fce761cf182dca6d6ddf73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/badfaa5da663e244abe956aacf26f3b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfa5b1bd90b4e2364170c39ade3551f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1148168e04bee577d7fa620c2948179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3234f929672f98f1969b61530aed969, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c408a682a7c3f90be1fa8101660091b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5b5b290801253a8b6e594889b7464fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc94809e56ebf51166e7e13c07878501, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cefb70da7bc32e29d95c7c81b7336269, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4af911d067167a3fa45f67bafb13998, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7e5d8995dbf7fcd23df38cecbf4d424, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd043efdb52e392bd28515abb634c64f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/decbea0bad90ec90d51cbe860f603390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfa80799c2948c373250a344177f245f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0208be1a3b2465759cf40d6c9e5ea13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3c274d5f2570d937442d87e9286f51d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7f5c160200102a06d4c02bd4df78680, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e84f3c58bf28b097ddb2f555578a0ec9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9922871291fc3cbc2da3b4485781692, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eef1c93deee8d0cd52e471a5a2b9ec26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efc549cbdfb458e613b48c6d79c479a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f95ddd583b0d5136232ac8c8143557c4"

For both, disease pathogenesis is thought to be immunologically mediated and there have been numerous reports of patients with elevated levels of proinflammatory and inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), in their sera. Multiple viruses have developed evasion strategies to circumvent the host cell inflammatory process, with one of the most prevalent being the disruption of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation. We hypothesized that hantaviruses might also moderate host inflammation by interfering with this pathway. We report here that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of HTNV was able to inhibit TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, as measured by a reporter assay, and the activation of endogenous p65, an NF-κB subunit. Surprisingly, there was no defect in the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) protein, nor was there any alteration in the level of p65 expression in HTNV N-expressing cells. However, immunofluorescence antibody staining demonstrated that cells expressing HTNV N protein and a green fluorescent protein-p65 fusion had limited p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, we were able to detect an interaction between HTNV N protein and importin α, a nuclear import molecule responsible for shuttling NF-κB to the nucleus. Collectively, our data suggest that HTNV N protein can sequester NF-κB in the cytoplasm, thus inhibiting NF-κB activity. These findings, which were obtained using cells transfected with cDNA representing the HTNV N gene, were confirmed using HTNV-infected cells.",""

Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto “throw away the physics, keep the organisation”. Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M, R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a fundamentally different approach that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature.

It was previously shown that two host cell proteins with molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa bind to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA at approximately 3 to 4 h after infection. We tested the hypothesis that preexisting cellular proteins are modified during the course of infection and are subsequently recruited to play a role in viral replication. It was demonstrated that the 38-kDa protein, either directly or indirectly, is the product of processing by poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase. Only the modified 38-kDa protein, not its precursor protein, has a high affinity for binding to the 3' end of viral negative-strand RNA. This modification depends on proteolytically active proteinase, and a direct correlation between the levels of 3CD proteinase and the 38-kDa protein was demonstrated in infected tissue culture cells. The nucleotide (nt) 5-10 region (positive-strand numbers) of poliovirus negative-strand RNA is important for binding of the 38-kDa protein. Deletion of the nt 5-10 region in full-length, positive-strand RNA renders the RNA noninfectious in transfection experiments. These results suggest that poliovirus 3CD/3C proteinase processes a cellular protein which then plays an essential role during the viral life cycle.",""

We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975–2002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975–2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = −0.61) and severity (r = −0.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019). This research supports the contention that cold, dry air may be related to influenza mortality and suggests that warning systems could provide enough lead time to be effective in mitigating the effects.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0584c2d43ec9e9a8fb6529a1f1b286e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/060559d5b2b89bfd61afed873683c388, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13c5d0b6796cf9c393f33545a2a73a31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/149a4ecaa7d85dad127a9793b0856c8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/176bad2fc1d0e2f7a327d9be804339b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/274475898a416f311288de5aab01bc29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/305a06f2dbb16566ec1ad534259b392d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31d10c417b92c61edab0fef1992c514a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3230a64a7052b023d610bcfacc565166, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4135b2585dd01b068483cd2e6f6bf699, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4abb87c9344c3dc6eaaee07068af5f80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56f84bc16aabd85dd53149ed9dbd54e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58d9a921a3936f0a125efa03b9589d4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6111d08f9c8ba0f8c4aa8ad47f7febf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f2763b4ea8a1b3281c8e8530f2ec480, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b7ab14846b5fc44d4eeff0f74af266c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/814dc4b6640450ffdbe2cd17b3b838f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89f4414f94f0047e5da9cfef936c1d04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9112da2fc5fa280373567b1a4f3979e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1fb2075393f37211d985fce53227d69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4a4ebe197d14c8e4911c8a910772697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb2db3c4db65046f12ecdbcc769ad972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdbb1639de4348b719d40e950e756eee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdef7f579759cd691250e0bbb2e47e6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b02df8713e38a69201e48f0a58d823, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7662736a878f4c9b6387bc6b62a0496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf79c8b91efe32a7250d24531cc70a38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7e97d39deffa9fdf149188261aaf79d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dae4fb40139e186ae645248a9cb331c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfb509bed3d8884df3f5ed9c6d2f8fcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b8f3d3fb5e86038243bde6ef0246c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8ba17b43b6915fdb2aceb82329b3c1f"

We hypothesized that immunostimulation by unmodified siRNA could mediate both RNAi as well as innate immune stimulation depending on the mode of drug delivery. We investigated the potential of immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs) to suppress influenza A virus in vivo in the mouse lung. Lipidoid 98N12-5(1) formulated with unmodified siRNA targeting the influenza nucleoprotein gene exhibited antiviral activity. Formulations were optimized to increase antiviral activity, but the antiviral activity of lipidoid-delivered siRNA did not depend on sequence homology to the influenza genome as siRNA directed against unrelated targets also suppressed influenza replication in vivo. This activity was primarily attributed to enhancement of innate immune stimulation by lipidoid-mediated delivery, which indicates increased toll-like receptor (TLR) activation by siRNA. Certain chemical modifications to the siRNA backbone, which block TLR7/8 activation but retain in vitro RNAi activity, prevented siRNA-mediated antiviral activity despite enhanced lipidoid-mediated delivery. Here, we demonstrate that innate immune activation caused by unmodified siRNA can have therapeutically relevant effects, and that these non-RNAi effects can be controlled through chemical modifications and drug delivery.",""

An in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), a useful tool for studying respiratory virus-host interactions, was used in this study to show that HPIV1 selectively infects ciliated cells within the HAE and that progeny virus is released from the apical surface with little apparent gross cytopathology. In HAE, type I interferon (IFN) is induced following infection with an HPIV1 mutant expressing defective C proteins with an F170S amino acid substitution, rHPIV1-C(F170S), but not following infection with wild-type HPIV1. IFN induction coincided with a 100- to 1,000-fold reduction in virus titer, supporting the hypothesis that the HPIV1 C proteins are critical for the inhibition of the innate immune response. Two recently characterized live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidates expressing mutant C proteins were also evaluated in HAE. The vaccine candidates, rHPIV1-C(R84G/Δ170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) and rHPIV1-C(R84G/Δ170)HN(T553A)L(Δ1710-11), which contain temperature-sensitive (ts) attenuating (att) and non-ts att mutations, were highly restricted in growth in HAE at permissive (32°C) and restrictive (37°C) temperatures. The viruses grew slightly better at 37°C than at 32°C, and rHPIV1-C(R84G/Δ170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) was less attenuated than rHPIV1-C(R84G/Δ170)HN(T553A)L(Δ1710-11).

Little is known concerning the regulation of ACE and ACE2 in the brain and the effect of EX on these enzymes, especially in the CHF state. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EX on the regulation of ACE and ACE2 in the brain in an animal model of CHF. We hypothesized that the ratio of ACE to ACE2 would increase in CHF and would be reduced by EX. Experiments were performed on New Zealand White rabbits divided into the following groups: sham, sham + EX, CHF, and CHF + EX (n = 5 rabbits/group). The cortex, cerebellum, medulla, hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) were analyzed.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the acute clinical manifestations represent acute on chronic inflammation. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is found in the granules of human neutrophils, with many diverse functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that levels NGAL in blood may reflect the inflammatory process in various stages of coronary artery disease. Methods. We studied 140 patients, with SA 40, UA 35, NSTEMI 40, and STEMI 25, and 20 healthy controls. Serum NGAL was measured upon admission and before coronary angiography. Results. Significant differences were observed in median serum-NGAL(ng/mL) between patients with SA (79.23 (IQR, 37.50–100.32)), when compared with UA (108.00 (68.34–177.59)), NSTEMI (166.49 (109.24–247.20)), and STEMI (178.63 (111.18–305.92)) patients and controls (50.31 (44.30–69.78)) with significant incremental value from SA to STEMI. We observed a positive and significant correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP (spearman coefficient rho = 0.685, P < 0.0001) as well as with neutrophil counts (r = 0.511, P < 0.0001). Conclusions. In patients with coronary artery disease serum levels of NGAL increase and reflect the degree of inflammatory process. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, serum levels of NGAL have high negative predictive value and reflecting the inflammatory status could show the severity of coronary clinical syndrome.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17b520f66a07c62d81ebaefb8d50aab9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c97025b9060db6ebb7b814c21b3d0b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dcf55377a0d4c632c3c103089f282bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/227725920108c81446dc834832eb380b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24274b923ebae065092bc5b2ed0db33a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2eb6df7eccedf4d2c3a9ee4d42da3631, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fe93d21d0cd7705d30876de236af54e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4224c5525f25ce65b9c19cffc3d01e6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42eb04bca487a14dbe10770f14985e96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44b23d37ab0a71b5f1dd186b5c834378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47f37e2328bc87b425d2916be888cb6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b4613f4160aeec717916b38a777e7bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/511b6e933d0705875c4f98a0e3642ecf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/511c53870d3f39561801dd09c653e8bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/545f207ab79272b5f2418718e0ce9498, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/586ee17d5c59c3c6929aedec8763e0c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e6a88c6b97e3e37ec3a213549e54537, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8023455e6c59e06052e58759434c0860, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94c6ced764aa39600cfb4d8ff28f08af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/988eb016b8875206e7f053f4226e4b31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2eb8b0b4f26386ed776af9531bb3cdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a55e6b4e9c989429a12f7ef1a83c4f3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7b335146e182d312d708737be69fc1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3e13f3efca4b20c7e60bb7aa7424eb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b44cfc9879c7a8c9a93cf6886499744b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b76d0fa65f54fa85f42c9ca9a4c205af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bab70cb60483fb84d5340d4e53107488, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf540af4be357eaf69495b8d2b83f18f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0eb963eea2662d9e03bfc6f2cd977e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4181e6aac4ca790b456dca2b313684e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd44689e2588b4dcbbdb066b599fcdec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0fff62e4c4d54baa796ae69836f77be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e75f25dcab12f9ec39100ba063171b41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa1466e4e4aa2fa4a285cd0d1b7f487f"

The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07f4b21f172021de921c07a1ac0184a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10d417c718fd290a2291c4b5a49f090e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1151630b19499799fc88dd03ba23e0ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17518a204127f518b047e4885a2a3a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1951cd2e1230dadfc99b340c9a5da510, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1965afa517a5a4be5df44d34dd6226ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19d6ae695f2f155fe64dfb648b272d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e208193a985529b0a6ea6effd9a3dc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2014127fc4e305a2d3dc56236d11ccd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/205ca8c35a19af0ac58a4b34420f550e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/250eb1a2766d4be3b8a4d57616a3f595, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25d2e384186206d877e7f42564af791b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2af8acddad75463624db2b77f5caa317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/316a531b790e5d50e872bec33c4562eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/378139b6f76c5ceea09fa18bcab93611, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/426d628eb589d7a9ffb49bb273b9e44b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44dde07d0f8a8a9ca30c3ced1e59ba74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46b0c7cd69e8189c0eb3563bc2bba531, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/484a1e71ea02dfdc6f986b409b5607b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a744034a7dc54bbf1f50488af766d63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59442fcd0d767debc14ad651375f41a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5aa04aa6da1d392e86d9f4811243d949, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61bcab7af20ca972971e2e7376214cce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62a16258d2521510eea7280351191640, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67099924e33bb2232444eec3d83b0c0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71e17438f34f5c94ac9cd64c2311393f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ae2b7009fe9907aafccc6b2b919f74c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8578c7f4111490acd6385322ca5a4757, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/865a9bdacacfac0f6750d7501485ccef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89622d7d8935d57e85fc002c3a9e1959, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89c0509fe5c2d52a9e96ebd511dc4c12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ae8f63b6a0e9d9d811319b5f7ceb393, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/932c0917445d5cfd06493f274616a0a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/962b24dd2c7fceb97e29f2487c3ee65a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/977a7a589c836a9b90b4d183fb3a250a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99fa150e415afcd4586c219efdce9f38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1e21c60c16bb3a8b5f75ec43231af7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a73ed409e731e3e694edbe25543aa9c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7dd216d067b7808add527dbd2486e98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa5506d28a320a9aa840ea2ea8cfeda9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad22468177b259dca5a79c0d779da1a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad8ea62ad229a540af5c79560b5128de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af3138635765c1e1bff4239d85f33feb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afeeb56207553e3d8021e965755a1887, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c390c2400ccfe5a226d81f39cf29f353, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf29ead281156bef49c689c26042bfed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5edada3dd1852933ec4716a098f82e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df822f29cb0da783075a5156018116de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e04142ac1b96b14c4c10f75443d51858, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b3924630852fc52afd165f2e2c9063, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e952e8251a9c35b894724d94725a6ad5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef6c7a6537a05e812685ada4f27bedb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0ec982e2fd09bc0cae2e73e0f7d0c29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4845a9978900f2746bcd38b0c10459e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4b139dbe2aba2831857f127c4effa7f"

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (−) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5′-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (−). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5′-UTR, CR-31-B (−) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5′-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dad8ae1a59fb1e0fa0859b104b85599, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3048f7e8479e6300e9f6ae173442fcff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34031b2f0cd5e940ebb4d78308f74fdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38639bf9fda7d8661ccc08d9586567d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f0be154c7ac356ca870f987887604ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d13b9d66f79b8cd3d1b52bf7cba0d13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56ec99a0b92f8f9533a911436d88163e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d2cf4a4efad57d08b9c8435b745aaaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8031190aaf80283c20ae51e50dc15a88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81d45cedfa04ec7917064cd7676ea641, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8522f45053972a47311350448ab72703, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8574f83a278b48805a1d8657eaab3774, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a5fdcb8c83948cc7f895a24a37464ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b3736bbece765875294d5053605232c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bff3f9ae69b629a072899ec9ee5b831, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e7b7ae7727260933522d3cc9f149e74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f0abd1b47d6fd941f23fef4cd209c3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9282b4215cf2c61e76871c91bca2c02f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c7e0b713f5f80521a3e74cc3ad97d48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aab68e30709690954248888a861be91a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b31205a89b7b76dc74db4daf55ccdd66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7ba19c2ad5c033963d647cf3a584354, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c86442cb29fe36154f7b137ff1e29566, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd18664c52414e16292fe3b473857307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3bb7d773eb9e8f021914411f56b3d17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6b62074ceee5f074b824e114d2a8baf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daad40d4018b50f1b6c2f2fc40189542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e11866eca95e9cd4db312ddfc581b317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4f570411e6292d3279e3977056f4a63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f818b8dd54ad72dc8d88bf0d0c0e39dc"

To develop lung gene therapies for this model, we evaluated recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene transfer to the neonatal ferret lung. Unlike in vitro ferret airway epithelial (FAE) cells, in vivo infection of the ferret lung with rAAV1 required proteasome inhibitors to achieve efficient airway transduction. We hypothesized that differences in transduction between these two systems were because of an in vivo secreted factor that alter the transduction biology of rAAV1. Indeed, treatment of rAAV1 with ferret airway secretory fluid (ASF) strongly inhibited rAAV1, but not rAAV2, transduction of primary FAE and HeLa cells. Properties of the ASF inhibitory factor included a strong affinity for the AAV1 capsid, heat-stability, negative charge, and sensitivity to endoproteinase Glu-C. ASF-treated rAAV1 dramatically inhibited apical transduction of FAE ALI cultures (512-fold), while only reducing viral entry by 55-fold, suggesting that postentry processing of virus was influenced by the inhibitor factor. Proteasome inhibitors rescued transduction in the presence of ASF (∼1600-fold) without effecting virus internalization, while proteasome inhibitors only enhanced transduction 45-fold in the absence of ASF. These findings demonstrate that a factor in lung secretions can influence intracellular processing of rAAV1 in a proteasome-dependent fashion.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/079002902b4b8f8d41331e526eb16f74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a71cc00078c839170dbf22d97c45c36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b6567517f353115ce8426be1301e795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c78ab8a3b5406076c2b750d70a754bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12d394e59720bc35c35be46f6207c753, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1713331ebc0210a4aa06459ddcd8db7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19b3cd3d6183e88f72cc0fc12648bb95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0083497358ac27f5cf7a9f10673197, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a91edea96dc800113a3f148cc084d90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d5f30730aa677b8aabbe361030d34d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f5b9e2a61f86649c0342e8d25358bfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/318b6805f3ef54105defb6ecc9c1a059, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c78440de12bb2109f5d0e6d988303e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/403c2045abbca0b90110dc46f3a8d5e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4af740cc47f020954067833b3f24f7f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c9647cebf66e5fa12d611870773f245, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cfe7fbca3b82974d5237ec751217fde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52908e3733527c5156669188184f5ddf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53f6e980bd610151bf0d7ebc39792545, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/580b409e60ea535ba3a6d30c8b67f101, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7553ce090aeb85b5762c0e3c385d7afa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87a8171eddee5532a7b96844e4b33162, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c0822a290fe6c7c6459ae075698ab5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a42370453085f732ce7a0019b66dc103, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4e80b9bc9353f4109a7683b1008282e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa525efaf9ebec1f3f8aa4a05ba49fb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aba638297fb5912c242d8529f99a7326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b283ee242d50a147fd154aee7cc46365, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b377b7ef1c2780fccae175b695ef0456, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b37db844dab8ebd0304423150b044869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b73a6a3d1d8dd67eacf6debb79e8d42b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1fcf2c18b1f6d7916d89e49f0a972ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c228f5bfc3c257cd2da481b09c9af2a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c78f968cf35933cb666360d0cfcc00a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce21854a3a61c8c379697579513479c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da2aed60a410c095970f27a102f4aff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db89d437e223d37b7db35a62521595ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd8d5d7de1b15ac32d6b50c3fc8181d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc6b92d26855ad96aa0d0e93783b6d6e"

These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac2. However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac2) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac2 from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant. Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC colonization in the human large intestine.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08367c16f3d6c5d967adadef6df9fc88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1146a9e7fce40d72a8743071c409285e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2232950923e09930f61b32253ca71814, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34ed708641ea7d5de5902acbe8c46e59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36a6e6b7456ad520e51684e40c64ea37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41a0a6e52a56627c0f36cb75db6cef82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5be8bb588edd18ce865f2c4d921209b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d373cd064138c7e661ed05ae6f8ee6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f812e20c02d9a6111b95b1c4aab5c4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8012add8aed612b61f46fd629ea162f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e37c778b0a5487fecc68a43918a6557, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f26bf030201810d5d8427f5b9d707f26"

In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector’s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease’s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268859c93e552107b94de7ddac86f00a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28f8caf9084d38f96f0bae58a2320e08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4adc85c7936bf2b85dcd1bce35fd2595, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/505292aa5e5f9cd4ce0dbe2ce6bc5996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/511ae9320f1a63c44e37855560643799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b0868d2d1cf9c6ecfa093ce813371b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b9626eb1c6d48725fab24f85e93581d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e433bd91f8aabe62f4161c1da6a11a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0f568d3ed789f7fe4909162bf0fc032, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b581f23a7e75498dbb31964f859aadb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c68fa05b63a6ebda195848593dc2085d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c739e89b4ec958bf271dd2b6b11f781e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d09f65628f6c2310e292e2e34c0a1f87"

Immunological mechanisms in the eye must be tightly regulated to ensure externally mediated injury and infection or internally mediated autoimmunity do not exceed self-defence tolerance. Vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) and their receptors exist in the mammalian eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process and the retina and may have a role in protecting these normally immune privileged sites. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP pathway. A sound blood supply is essential for retinal survival hence vascular compromise will have serious consequences. Retinal vasculitis is a potentially blinding condition with a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases. Compromise of the endothelial barriers and the blood retina barrier (BRB) may instigate inflammatory responses setting up a chain of events involving VNs in a manner which provokes autoimmunity to them. Protection from BRB breakdown may be linked to nitric oxide (NO) effects and actions of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cAMP production. Induced NO expressed under influences of inflammatory mediators evokes neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis and may lead to serious ocular disease including retinal injury. Other inflammatory mediators also play a role in retinal pathology. PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract and PACAP attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons suggesting that compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability though glutamate toxicity. Additional effects of VN compromise would possibly occur through unopposed vasoconstriction and inflammation. Proof of this hypothesis has important implications for treatment and prevention of autoimmune retinopathy and blindness as a number of therapeutic pathways may be opened. Importantly for therapeutic contexts cAMP effects are maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors which could be used in VN autoimmune disorders. A compelling case may exist to undertake a therapeutic trial of VN replacement, PDE inhibitors and other agents in autoimmune retinopathies resulting from possible VN autoimmunity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5218ec07ffca5536f7855d6b014580a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59f8826e05d5163f8ffcbcf08b74cf18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ccd58d5c2cbbdf28fd5e25b01728558, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e7e900c67ea87d6879ad75e533b74ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e5599292f7afdcd6e53644336ce440b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8191599adf3651d57f227ac151b0ed71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/878488b4c1c2551dbd1484b820c617cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/937c19acde3d9301a630c83e83b88086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aba800b8f78d16f11786381ccad28dd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b06f295a71eb8db6dc86dbb9d25ff85c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b23b6bb2bba3f22a849054c8fc7db430, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb435c8f8413821625c49e9879050a42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be71dc97062a584d3d8e2a241f2dd312, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8b6cdecd3225e4940291568d7895212, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ced19a94fa5e2c6ea94901b1d8002042, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfa4722f31cae1b83c0bac62c6209c7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2346c6d57c4f0bca4c5f50d3c86d1b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b1a9bd111757a7f8ed52fce3a7a055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e48d0b4c85487a5c5a3c608ca2a8f09d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5755c095b3ab49ef9eac849da6071be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee25fc6e7de1e349104daf70b4b61191, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f05352ea83fb85d2274cfbdaebfc4a84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f49e8682dc53bead88b1e87cb1e16ea5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8c2f544ca93975854023572c21d4349"

It was hypothesized that both obsessive–compulsive (OC) beliefs and OC symptoms would significantly predict Swine Flu fears. It was also hypothesized that symptoms of anxiety, including measures of anxiety sensitivity and disgust sensitivity would significantly mediate the relationship between both OC beliefs and OC symptoms and Swine Flu fears. A total of 393 undergraduate students completed measures of Swine Flu fears, anxiety sensitivity, OC beliefs and symptoms, and disgust sensitivity. It was found that both OC beliefs and OC symptoms significantly predicted Swine Flu fears. While disgust sensitivity significantly mediated the relationship between both OC beliefs and OC symptoms and Swine Flu fears using the Sobel test, anxiety sensitivity was a significant mediator only for OC symptoms. Additionally, path modeling showed that anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between OC symptoms and Swine Flu fears best. The results of this study may be useful for treating individuals suffering from anxiety in light of future pandemics, as well as continuing to research the role of anxiety symptoms in predicting pandemic fears.",""

Here, we synthesize literature on human, plant, and animal diseases to evaluate the relative contributions of host, pathogen, and environmental factors in driving transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space. We show that host and spatial heterogeneity are closely linked and that quantitatively assessing the contribution of infectious individuals, species, or environmental patches to overall transmission can aid management strategies.

Viruses are everywhere and all organisms are permanently exposed to them. The result of this contact depends on the particular moment a t which a given cell is exposed to the virus. Rubella, for example, provokes a very benign disease in adults, but can induce abnormalities in the differentiating fetus. Although interferon is active against virus aggression, excess interferon has a toxic effect and can block differentiation.

The mosquito-borne Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the Togaviridae family and is an important biodefense pathogen and select agent. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for VEEV infections; therefore, it is imperative to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication. We have shown that at non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib, a FDA-approved inhibitor of the proteasome, proved to be a potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication in the human astrocytoma cell line U87MG. Bortezomib inhibited the virulent Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain and the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV. Additional studies with virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) demonstrated that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the New World alphaviruses. Time-of-addition assays showed that Bortezomib was an effective inhibitor of viral multiplication even when the drug was introduced many hours post exposure to the virus. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the VEEV capsid protein is ubiquitinated in infected cells, which was validated by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequent studies revealed that capsid is ubiquitinated on K48 during early stages of infection which was affected by Bortezomib treatment. This study will aid future investigations in identifying host proteins as potential broad spectrum therapeutic targets for treating alphavirus infections.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05d7b92f395ce1961b9626753d4ad344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bd0bacfc06f2b35fe8242f5e36001dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fe2fa9a368ea3a1f2782a6d87cd1fdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1feffae292a31ef8c6cfbf806276a709, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29bb45b552396c9b8565b46c8d7488b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32e0fcf03b053da22d435d3d0a3ea71a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dad7f8e87a01364e92b9e11bee6d8e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4383baf8663808431ce961d616cd92fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4764139fb6d6330793a2b87c6b9ad933, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4868854d9bd149da98fa906c4d21d7ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bd19692f4abdc3bfe2753914ce56bad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4de262fd53ae32ef3e2ec2fc0290d989, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52d1d1ad04d9b2cf3d4f90001df98ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/534d93a9ff1ef43f3c79d9c93d1dd805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/566ccafcf4fd61bbf549327604e1be38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5892a344ecedc97b4b102ef17ac73140, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b80e28ec26982fe24a24e4c21a6e47b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e52d401f6fc9dc119ed66693db13523, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f99fb124ab584f34fce0bfff96b147b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/650b78513ebfbef87d6a8b945bb2d604, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b0bbb10de187db92da8a5a3a29f9cfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b6051a82da6dfab427044a5a14209f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b9b14adc1454c18e537eb8e28041ab6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6be8b62605cf9b0d7aa064784d0460f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/739eb3d8f7e428a03ad3f628565c8fb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7745c8d681e1fa759ccfdede2df3dfd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bef21a18cd65df10dea1b5274ecd0b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ec78a5afaeeb1ccb38b8cc0530a2eb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f4e55a0e973c6b7e008e4a02c28e5b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8209eee633b6d3cd47adf4f24596a3df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d298317ef20c1754d62b1edbed6c3ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d8ddb048925ba4a8d41a20f0a6c739, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e2a0bd007e8d15fbf524c4e31841fb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a233a38cab9c269a2166527a2e261aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6f74a2ff9bbeeb7d19e1bd3375361ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb92d1aece0197755c54aadfd5cc0edc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c94fd364ceb26de72f1d91868fe6ccb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc28b8077d14dcb5a05f8249f1273bbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc55d3553957615ed8f69c351f26c517, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddad89417e974aebb02c259469dc2dd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3166d259cc839b911baa73e828ef153, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e85b2a1c94483b5d999011f76cea0d36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e91708baa05166c08cf05b2b181e9ace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef5879cc90c4061eced860cd8b666514, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f613af269b6d7194d43c242e1acc599e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9d003a7b0d6bece93e63bfea6824cc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f131f48c99f165ba21ffe7bca8b923, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f6c298385e9323850b0a72d101405b"

Brain microvessels and intestine brush-border cells were shown to present a high concentration of aminopeptidase N. Moreover, a labeling of various brain structures was observed. A very high level of binding occurred in the meninges, choroid plexus, pineal gland, paraventricular nucleus and pituitary gland. Moderate to high labeling was also observed in the cortex, caudate–putamen, subthalamic nucleus, central periaqueductal gray, thalamus, as well as in the dorsal and ventral horn of the spinal cord, which are known to contain a high concentration of enkephalins, opioid receptors and neutral endopeptidase. This co-localization confirms the physiological implication of aminopeptidase N in the inactivation of enkephalins accounting for the requirement of dual inhibition of neutral endopeptidase and aminopeptidase N to observe highly significant morphine-like effects induced by the protected endogenous opioid peptides. Aminopeptidase N was also visualized in moderate to high levels in other brain structures such as the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, hypothalamus (dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei), raphe nucleus, pontine nucleus, inferior olive, and in high concentration in the granular layer of cerebellum. In summary, aminopeptidase N has been visualized for the first time in numerous brain areas using the selective inhibitor [125I]RB 129. This iodinated probe could allow the ex vivo and in vivo localization of aminopeptidase N in various tissues to be investigated and may also be used to evaluate quantitative changes in aminopeptidase N expression in pathological situations. Aminopeptidase N, which preferably removes NH2-terminal neutral amino acids from peptides, has probably a host of substrates. Nevertheless, a certain in vivo selectivity could be achieved by the presence of the enzyme in structures where the peptide effector and its receptors are also co-localized.",""

There is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus. The presence of coronaviruses, closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian bats, presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species. The possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers. Rectal swabs and serum from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for MERS-CoV and a Nycteris sp. bat coronavirus, previously detected in Ghana. A pan-PCR assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike IgG antibodies against the target viruses were used. Likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms (41.9%) that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes. Livestock were left unconfined on eight farms (25.8%) that also observed bats roosting in trees close to their homes. No viral RNA or antibodies against the two coronaviruses were detected in any of the livestock species tested. Cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine are not likely hosts of clade 2c coronaviruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003bc14404684b2b0ac426cff7cd521b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b1bb46b3860a0b3e457dfa4f4c9a3c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/129d9cb22c1a4a4fdcf48c5b3ba914e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13d367692f333efeb8237e0ab0f92d61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1521b61d070351c2943f09989fb40a43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17c8064c979c9b7dfc3afbeef9cd899e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/196f56537be4cebe5c79764b6a5a6e06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fcebf2460094e165db69961702f0ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/222b9d44147ccfdc16d088720d4f1b8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27985d29b8583b5cc735422489eb100c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29deed349246ec76c47aca0d1168e671, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3056e0961b77326798e553eea10917d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/387439a6b1a2404054ea7f8b8fd25e8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38c08560f75ff99d93d8da9bf36d0996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44098e7b137b84c1692d400aa75fed01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/443e22c90d0138ed4161b8efc18ee241, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/493761a13332a0aede9ba98e02079df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57951f655d773c6664c80b5560588756, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c46a8bcdb3ce049417c0acdeb100c41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63856c4ea923ee36165a07ad55f06eb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/662f0623a95829f2b9ad0c2db5523c80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/674adcff62e90b4944748cbd6a85d253, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bf24a28ecfcfc8e0f0f1748770feace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c92a562bcf0350cc4983eb5bd8b0843, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/733f83ad55266a6f1e80bf819b2db287, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74aaac63cd1ca75479b7dea730206f6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75b676b0fa3e950e543674f5af9a062e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9667743586a927f91dfbdc88f23fd793, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dbb456dd80762bdff07dc433d03f3e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dcd05538739f221f32e2060f4fab1df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e991c7f7c41b4e47d5c9da9fd539d0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f7b384ee4448a17bbdd5a5084cff6f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5a83d90eb8b9e918000ca7f12886f42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7ad92c177607cdf5517c5bc3df10d15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a905d26e040bd863ffdf961b1a3eec38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba9dcc94d33e438c7b82c42f59504f85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7db9b12f8768244b60a1534e359dbdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4ad2aafe59eaead28276beac50dcc7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d50592db1549fa8dee5a78d6379b74d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da69079daad2486d2ec80c115c44233a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2e684d2da26a64ec64f6bb98feeb608, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9c6b828982cfa39d66c6d7818cc8fa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6e3e2a00dc404ee014c155b2c0c91c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb4355a9a0a82500701e8280734fcc22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fffdcf030a44300b1cdcf72137f02eda"

Since then, several bats throughout the world have been shown to shed CoV sequences, and presumably CoVs, in the feces; however, no bat CoVs have been isolated from nature. Moreover, there are very few bat cell lines or reagents available for investigating CoV replication in bat cells or for isolating bat CoVs adapted to specific bat species. Here, we show by molecular clock analysis that alphacoronavirus (α-CoV) sequences derived from the North American tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) are predicted to share common ancestry with human CoV (HCoV)-NL63, with the most recent common ancestor between these viruses occurring approximately 563 to 822 years ago. Further, we developed immortalized bat cell lines from the lungs of this bat species to determine if these cells were capable of supporting infection with HCoVs. While SARS-CoV, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), and chimeric SARS-CoVs bearing the spike genes of early human strains replicated inefficiently, HCoV-NL63 replicated for multiple passages in the immortalized lung cells from this bat species. These observations support the hypothesis that human CoVs are capable of establishing zoonotic-reverse zoonotic transmission cycles that may allow some CoVs to readily circulate and exchange genetic material between strains found in bats and other mammals, including humans.",""

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

Although blocking plant virus transmission would allow for crop protection, virus receptors in insect vectors are unknown. Here we identify membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) coat protein (CP) in the gut of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a far-Western blot method. Pulldown and immunofluorescence binding assays and surface plasmon resonance were used to confirm and characterize CP-APN interaction. PEMV virions and a peptide comprised of PEMV CP fused to a proline-rich hinge (-P-) and green fluorescent protein (CP-P-GFP) specifically bound to APN. Recombinant APN expressed in Sf9 cells resulted in internalization of CP-P-GFP, which was visualized by confocal microscopy; such internalization is an expected hallmark of a functional gut receptor. Finally, in assays with aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles, binding of CP-P-GFP competed with binding of GBP3.1, a peptide previously demonstrated to bind to APN in the aphid gut and to impede PEMV uptake into the hemocoel; this finding supports the hypothesis that GBP3.1 and PEMV bind to and compete for the same APN receptor. These in vitro data combined with previously published in vivo experiments (S. Liu, S. Sivakumar, W. O. Sparks, W. A. Miller, and B. C. Bonning, Virology 401:107–116, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.009) support the identification of APN as the first receptor in a plant virus vector. Knowledge of this receptor will provide for technologies based on PEMV-APN interaction designed to block plant virus transmission and to suppress aphid populations. IMPORTANCE A significant proportion of global food production is lost to insect pests. Aphids, in addition to weakening plants by feeding on their sap, are responsible for transmitting about half of the plant viruses vectored by insects. Growers rely heavily on the application of chemical insecticides to manage both aphids and aphid-vectored plant viral disease. To increase our understanding of plant virus-aphid vector interaction, we provide in vitro evidence supporting earlier in vivo work for identification of a receptor protein in the aphid gut called aminopeptidase N, which is responsible for entry of the plant virus pea enation mosaic virus into the pea aphid vector. Enrichment of proteins found on the surface of the aphid gut epithelium resulted in identification of this first aphid gut receptor for a plant virus. This discovery is particularly important since the disruption of plant virus binding to such a receptor may enable the development of a nonchemical strategy for controlling aphid-vectored plant viruses to maximize food production.",""

Spontaneous diabetes in LEW.1WR1 rats (RT1(u/u/a)) occurs with a cumulative frequency of ∼2% at a median age of 59 days. The disease is characterized by hyperglycemia, glycosuria, ketonuria and polyuria. Both sexes are affected, and islets of acutely diabetic rats are devoid of beta cells whereas alpha and delta cell populations are spared. The peripheral lymphoid phenotype is normal, including the fraction of ART2(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs).

Treatment of young rats with depleting anti-ART2.1 mAb increased the frequency of diabetes to 50%. Treatment with the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid increased the frequency of diabetes to 100%. All diabetic rats exhibited end-stage islets.

Study design A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. Results Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. Conclusions NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11aeeaba371bedcc913de12436229fc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d65999a72328c4d4c9da52c72c2e119, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b59c6ea337879c0194a74e919e8696c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55bfa640344576e4ec4e9c13c41c1cfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c35c655ada6f5bafb563a0bf9f12b5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8ebbb3360cbeb0495baa4473ddd91a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e27fb32023eef87499e40cac51bb850a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eee11a46cd822ee64f5b0aab0f8b7b6d"

A preferred method in rats is the implantation of a polyurethane catheter into the jugular vein, with heparinized glycerol as a lock solution. However, analysis of various biologic compounds (for example, microRNA) precludes the use of heparin. We used sodium citrate as an alternative to heparin but observed more frequent loss of catheter patency. We hypothesized that this effect was due to evaporation of lock solution at the exteriorized portion of the catheter, subsequent blood infiltration into the catheter, and ultimately clot formation within the catheter. We therefore tested evaporation and its variables in vitro by using 5 common catheter materials. We used the migration of dye into vertically anchored catheters as a measure of lock displacement due to evaporation. Exposure to dry room-temperature air was sufficient to cause dye migration against gravity, whereas a humid environment and adding glycerol to the lock solution mitigated this effect, thus confirming loss of the lock solution from the catheter by evaporation. We tested 4 catheter treatments for the ability to reduce lock evaporation. Results were validated in vivo by using male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 12) implanted with polyurethane jugular vein catheters and randomized to receive a nitrocellulose-based coating on the exteriorized portion of the catheter. Coating the catheters significantly improved patency, as indicated by a Kaplan–Meier log-rank hazard ratio greater than 5 in untreated catheters. We here demonstrate that a simple nitrocellulose coating reduces evaporation from and thus prolongs the patency of polyurethane catheters in rats.",""

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE1) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was previously reported to show association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is also thought to play a key role in damaging the lung tissues in SARS cases. This time, the polymorphism was genotyped in 44 Vietnamese SARS cases, with 103 healthy controls who had had a contact with the SARS patients and 50 controls without any contact history. SARS cases were divided into either non-hypoxemic or hypoxemic groups. Despite the small sample size, the frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in the hypoxemic group than in the non-hypoxemic group (p =0.013), whereas there was no significant difference between the SARS cases and controls, irrespective of a contact history.

Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. RESULTS: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified. CONCLUSION: This extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the stepwise evolution of different functional proteins of SARS-CoVs at different epidemic stages and different hosts.

OBJECTIVE: Moving beyond Omran's original formulation, we discuss critiques and modifications of the theory of epidemiologic transitions and highlight some of the ways in which incorporating epidemiologic transition theory can benefit theory and practice in epidemiology. DESIGN: We focus on two broad contemporary trends in human health that epidemiologic transition theory is useful for conceptualizing: the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as allergic and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. RESULTS: Situating these trends within epidemiologic transition theory, we explain the rise in CIDs with the hygiene hypothesis and the rise in emerging and reemerging infections with the concept of a third epidemiologic transition. CONCLUSIONS: Contextualizing these trends within epidemiologic transition theory reveals implications for clinical practice, global health policies, and future research within epidemiology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07a70b13b01a19deba3e5abf81481dc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/174fb2cba45e36949678890bc3143364, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22a8e1b67d34291fe1a7e1c4b9eec24e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c3ed775f0110b6e7b096e455b6a7dba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/304f7d1fb12375d7e2d83e6e9be48808, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59b64ddadb04f8687ca708d8ae83c19c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bbc2f2164301f8c207d79b0a2d7a9d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77ad1add2a9aa27cfb32213eae2f1915, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92c6a767c7af2e0802d91f1dbc879c43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9313911904ef19b23e3dedb141ab2fa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bbecf92849fe2efe04c9961b77390c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e55ef3a55e29bf0235b6085d310fe50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b125ce81f0a7df92405c2bdd014d5f23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b186155f9cf210d67282496adf6799a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b91d32efee715d4f15f7cde83ffb87d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbbe54798cd04bdbc00048558af2cdfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0fdff662414212fddb8586ad8759ef1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c849b94e2f469402be2aeaf2655546fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cafd5533fa7c92293ae323c5e7830ffe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/deda2df829546a07baa83ef7e0766246, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e38753f87c1988622852ffda51fb665d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6cc1786d4312073169618ed744dfb71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb5a51fc9f00e362f9548cf7a36047db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecf8bb953539841700d1650a6a363ab1"

Emphasis is initially placed upon the bone osteoclast, the skeletal muscle myotube and the placental syncytiotrophoblast. The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from “without” and viral fusion from “within” the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed. The possible importance of MNGC formation in the depletion of the CD4+ population of T-lymphocytes in vivo in the clinical progression of the AIDS-related complex and AIDS is related to the potent fusogenic effect of HIV-1 when cell cultures are infected.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c15315985672492ec972c6ea9bb1328, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cd887cc1daa8df937f2b325e507d1de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25f2fa951ce72e79c68b888e0c903b3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a26f16ba7c8ce21128f0211e8941520, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a541d74a34e547b8ab750b56998b439, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bbcc04aa28139bf0d33a448a234d998, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31e2450a808494d8c8ec92971f53dda6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4260d22afb9d7987cdc9bb2ff42e0768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49e4d6beb4ab58e91121480ae81729db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51b1ad1c9cdc847f2254f8d9373f2217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/544fc03552ded3a75420cda9efcac931, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65a082b1db7d26a742d0e03d447d2f61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/707867e7059e9b2fd5661ecbf4d024a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77d0715d55af90d508eda4afaf54fc73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/797b1f3e0d9f6b206323ae8ad3b81b24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8168546a7f7dc9189cb6715c1a4e3535, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83cd422c364e95b3bee8c57cabfbb8bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/864a3672e023a90eca8e40912a1d2bd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89c20575f7f3471692102e19fc96b3d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9050050109a49778c7b61246bc6ba58e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e896b25a354e039cbfea55286eb417a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f27b778d468a93d19925a2189ca60f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a480f7e0e856e721d41bcb9ded6a333d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab0d5ec345b2ecfc42a859e73378fda7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b21b58865e1acbc6859582ab7b8ceeb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b337566b6039bc00d3574bd0f5783b6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b37a7de372e268a7af08b023995f2ff1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b54ba0127be5d53bb4a24d51abcf54eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3060e8c9718c89e594c157160f23eda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c92e9b1d5862ab8121b9866839f5b692, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb3f24b4821a95e8dd8241caa4ae2f7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdcd92fc4bac212ee157602b32c2f78a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce46819a581e6860db29da1271a5b922, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d21500a7b54b376af1c9120575a3f387, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfd8a598c22550468555d2ab27abe406, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb1da1b78a12288ed4a681d4236f44f9"

We employed cDNA microarray analysis to characterize the cellular transcriptional responses of homologous human genes at 12 h post-infection. Seventy mRNA transcripts belonging to various functional classes exhibited significant alterations in gene expression. There was considerable induction of heat shock proteins that are crucial to the immune response mechanism. Modified levels of several transcripts involved in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes exemplified the balance between opposing forces during SARS pathogenesis. Other genes displaying altered transcription included those associated with host translation, cellular metabolism, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, protein trafficking, protein modulators, and cytoskeletal proteins. Alterations in the levels of several novel transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins and expressed sequence tags were also identified. In addition, transcription of apoptosis-related genes DENN and hIAP1 was upregulated in contrast to FAIM. Elevated Mx1 expression signified a strong host response to mediate antiviral resistance. Also expressed in infected cells was the C-terminal alternative splice variant of the p53 tumor suppressor gene encoding a modified truncated protein that can influence the activity of wild-type p53. We observed the interplay between various mechanisms to favor virus multiplication before full-blown apoptosis and the triggering of several pathways in host cells in an attempt to eliminate the pathogen. Microarray analysis identifies the critical host–pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV infection and provides new insights into the pathophysiology of SARS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13508e69fc034280ccc1cf6cd76881f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1af09d31efac3f36d0a39b801f8fc853, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c2fbbc7558d83ffce94a5fe19ca68ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21618cdd751d84ea0eea4ff6b453de05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/240eebfd6520e51f51e6c210cdc36915, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2485ff8c30d704df2b1fccac0d09dfbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24ce142c3c8ff118e79d1a5b49b89838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/258bb48a7cc891d5fbef9e9e267014a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c0a6ee174434eb1affd5d9007f593c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33619c959c77b36f1142a59ffe69e2ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3372d336626655a9aa9e47ef89015018, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33bf80abf023ed08a6c3c81cbfa5ccaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38fbe142a71fa4602ccae33293e1f73d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44b3c3756273a9a52fda55e171424599, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/479e36b21dec19b498d06cf306216abb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bfa3d43ad6a6ce01b30fd30ac0db608, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b17ba09a445fec16cd3d1f4ad4fb1a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c5dd295f9bb065d3417d5a8699b34ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cd803b33697c35805c0fe1a56876415, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/603ffeb89ea2249c6d5e8f2bb567bc9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/622b09e6fca5b3704fb4f35a6fb8e383, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/705252bf8725c4b0e8133199554d9104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7067fd9e978c21c65bff0b334200658c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70934d2f70c662f004c13ed57e83bc10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b834b35f10969352e72584437b50556, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d6a001aced5abe659e3672ba11cf5b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a2da21c9b87452129e1537cae1bb8e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a8e4096231745b0f99a0676e49ad77e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/964a38eba7576e6a7bc73d32f0363f61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9caa82473c51afff0733466f69e77738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd113d61879be5127832d1d22f1859c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a08a1d8d7853260dff694ed7d7521019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3e70b59fde1c0df420c6926ba88f22b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c5ca99f59598cf6bb3207c24b79e7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b342218688a2a49348a0cd162e89b888, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4b6f804a9d1d82c77d620ee7aa10b0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6d7f239c2234fba50a49633e51c246d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2305dd540e87bd88b6f8ce5ad9afba2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9b94353091aed87121d1d9c5fecbdd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daa14aedc0697fa9de10ec9201ccf605, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e06f30f2000ca2699a42d39a9b5d930e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e717c0b70142df05de22bf36b723e01b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb907558096709965d7b3d7759dc755d"

Some strains of LCMV exploit high affinity interactions with α-dystroglycan (α-DG) to bind to cell surfaces and subsequently fuse in low pH endosomes. LCMV strains with low α-DG affinity utilize an unknown receptor and display unique tissue tropisms. We pseudotyped non-primate feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vectors using LCMV derived glycoproteins with high or low affinity to α-DG and evaluated their properties in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We pseudotyped FIV with the LCMV WE54 strain envelope glycoprotein and also engineered a point mutation in the WE54 envelope glycoprotein (L260F) to diminish α-DG affinity and direct binding to alternate receptors. We hypothesized that this change would alter in vivo tissue tropism and enhance gene transfer to neonatal animals. RESULTS: In mice, hepatic α- and β-DG expression was greatest at the late gestational and neonatal time points. When displayed on the surface of the FIV lentivirus the WE54 L260F mutant glycoprotein bound weakly to immobilized α-DG. Additionally, LCMV WE54 pseudotyped FIV vector transduction was neutralized by pre-incubation with soluble α-DG, while the mutant glycoprotein pseudotyped vector was not. In vivo gene transfer in adult mice with either envelope yielded low transduction efficiencies in hepatocytes following intravenous delivery. In marked contrast, neonatal gene transfer with the LCMV envelopes, and notably with the FIV-L260F vector, conferred abundant liver and lower level cardiomyocyte transduction as detected by luciferase assays, bioluminescent imaging, and β-galactosidase staining. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a developmentally regulated receptor for LCMV is expressed abundantly in neonatal mice. LCMV pseudotyped vectors may have applications for neonatal gene transfer.

SLC26A4 encodes pendrin, an anion exchanger located in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney. The goal of the present study was to determine whether developmental delays, possibly mediated by systemic or local hypothyroidism, contribute to the failure to develop hearing in mice lacking Slc26a4 (Slc26a4(−/−)). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurements, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination of plasma thyroxine levels. Cochlear development was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. No differences in plasma thyroxine levels were found in Slc26a4(−/−) and sex-matched Slc26a4(+/−) littermates between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P90. In adult Slc26a4(−/−) mice, the transepithelial potential and the pH of thyroid follicles were reduced. No differences in the expression of genes that participate in thyroid hormone synthesis or ion transport were observed at P15, when plasma thyroxine levels peaked. Scala media of the cochlea was 10-fold enlarged, bulging into and thereby displacing fibrocytes, which express Dio2 to generate a cochlear thyroid hormone peak at P7. Cochlear development, including tunnel opening, arrival of efferent innervation at outer hair cells, endochondral and intramembraneous ossification, and developmental changes in the expression of Dio2, Dio3, and Tectb were delayed by 1–4 days. These data suggest that pendrin functions as a HCO(3)(−) transporter in the thyroid, that Slc26a4(−/−) mice are systemically euthyroid, and that delays in cochlear development, possibly due to local hypothyroidism, lead to the failure to develop hearing.",""

During the acute phase of infection (first 48 h), minus and plus strands accumulated at the same rate initially, but maximal accumulation of minus strands peaked earlier than that for plus strands, indicating that minus- and plus-strand levels are differentially regulated. In addition, packaged (input) mRNAs appeared to serve as templates for their own early replication. mRNA replication continued throughout establishment and maintenance of persistent infection (studied for 120 days), which is consistent with our hypothesis that mRNA replication contributes mechanistically to virus persistence. A replication-defective (potentially interfering) species of RNA existed transiently (beginning at day 2 and ending before day 76 postinfection), but because of its transient nature it cannot be considered essential to the long-term maintenance of virus persistence.",""

This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs; 4 live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I and III) and 3-day-old (in exp. II) KO and wild-type (WT) piglets were inoculated with TCID50 1x103 PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow’s colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals were euthanized for necropsy, and their intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.",""

Although alveolar macrophages from CFTR−/− mice have impaired function, no study has investigated primary alveolar macrophages in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF patients have low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and our prior studies demonstrate a relationship between IGF-1 and macrophage function. We hypothesize that reduced IGF-1 in CF leads to impaired alveolar macrophage function and chronic infections. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained from 8 CF subjects and 8 healthy subjects. Macrophages were isolated from BAL fluid. We measured the ability of alveolar macrophages to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subsequently, macrophages were incubated with IGF-1 prior to inoculation with bacteria to determine the effect of IGF-1 on bacterial killing. We found a significant decrease in bacterial killing by CF alveolar macrophages compared to controls. CF subjects had lower serum and BAL IGF-1 levels compared to healthy controls. Exposure to IGF-1 enhanced alveolar macrophage macrophages in both groups. Finally, exposing healthy alveolar macrophages to CF BAL fluid decreased bacterial killing, and this was reversed by the addition of IGF-1, while IGF-1 blockade worsened bacterial killing. Our studies demonstrate that alveolar macrophage function is impaired in patients with CF. Reductions in IGF-1 levels in CF contribute to the impaired alveolar macrophage function. Exposure to IGF-1 ex vivo, results in improved function of CF alveolar macrophages. Further studies are needed to determine whether alveolar macrophage function can be enhanced in vivo with IGF-1 treatment.",""

Because T cell selection by peptide plus self-MHC in the thymus requires TCR engagement, we hypothesized that type 1 cytokines may polarize developing T cells. We cultured thymi from BBDR rats in adult thymus organ cultures (ATOC) under type 1 cytokine conditions in the absence of exogenous antigen. Type 1 cytokine-conditioned ATOC generated cells that spontaneously secreted high levels of IFNγ, but not IL-4. A second exposure to type 1 cytokines further increased IFNγ secretion by these cells, most of which were blasts that expressed the activation markers CD25, CD71, CD86, and CD134. Studies using blocking antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors suggested that both IL-18 and cognate TCR–MHC/ligand interactions were important for activation. Blocking anti-MHC class I plus anti-MHC class II antibodies, neutralizing anti-IL-18 antibody, and the p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor SB203580 each reduced IFNγ production by ∼75–80%. Cyclosporin A, which prevents TCR signaling, inhibited IFNγ production by ∼50%. These data demonstrate that exposure to type 1 cytokines during intrathymic development can polarize differentiating T cells, and suggest a mechanism by which intrathymic exposure to type 1 cytokines may modulate T cell development.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21f3740cc6aad5910b21c47880974384, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/277b92da5e71fdd0273a63ca24d04052, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34f713b50a26d29225514af43c330f0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3adaa8a65a7b93db03843718aa213ea1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b4781f42168c25a8b88c07cdbdffe89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/411c2c62337d81934d5bd41c283da169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41f31530a6e9a484727678149883a19c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b49d3a0406bf6dbdc4fbc82cbd3d07d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65c1a9469af85ebe746352b4b1d1f2ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68941de088d38135b3d11eeb1e4fc97d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ade9bce58496c6bb8aaf6fbb5f0199f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d308e347f8cab8f3cbc3578647d61be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d67398c39bee08a02d2b22492a446ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a1d371057cec3de5021623663ac81d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a289f56658a15209641c74cd63b81a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b793d0fd5659d82d813e23a5e726061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f22595bb8b5944ef0f9300a2230bea7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a033d75d3e0680531d1223c6f651267d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2bd26773268fa37de1d9c028bdd77e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2c4cb85d76cbb2c800e09e854855611, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a852a5d6b95e61426d5d159c90892e14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0823bd03f6c00a1eeee2499d8df2a1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1fb878a929df8afe4ad73eba5419743, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c228666a3d4fedf91d9409c392250218, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29dfbfd7172aa2c63662129e598267c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c903c1ae77cd9d5e5c7097c86e3e2c3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd97af721a74dd6cb353271a11873388, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0e222a38dbc599f2e407e30990a6653, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d152573e3abba39e9cfd263f3dc9865f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e11b98ed996f81a80dc2123f23cfc3c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1e62de9c29dd78acd2bd0e3db00bb1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e51a4d1039d51d9739a1d442cc5bbac9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5f65605908890b490556cf86d2dba03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed06c7aa9530af5aea432385499bba1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed17c2aa97e370f584a2c99501f9ce9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efcb352b1f56d623f7740fe9fde470ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f388569f1509a3c3eddf488134b8ad11"

Damage‐ and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns contribute to a self‐perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM‐1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐mimicking complexes GF9‐HDL and GA/E31‐HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5‐week alcohol feeding with the Lieber‐DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM‐1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol‐fed mice, and TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM‐1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol‐induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM‐1 signaling. The TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly inhibited macrophage (epidermal growth factor‐like module‐containing mucin‐like hormone receptor‐like 1 [F4/80], clusters of differentiation [CD]68) and neutrophil (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) markers and proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP‐1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α], interleukin‐1β [IL‐1β], macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP‐1α]) at the mRNA level compared to the HDL vehicle. Administration of TREM‐1 inhibitors ameliorated liver steatosis and early fibrosis markers (α‐smooth muscle actin [αSMA] and procollagen1α [Pro‐Col1α]) at the mRNA level in alcohol‐fed mice. However, the HDL vehicle also reduced serum ALT and some cytokine protein levels in alcohol‐fed mice, indicating HDL‐related effects. Conclusion: HDL‐delivered novel TREM‐1 peptide inhibitors ameliorate early phases of inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and activation in the liver and attenuate hepatocyte damage and liver steatosis. TREM‐1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for further investigations in ALD.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0003b4bde61a1ca79d9de8eac5d2a43b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/077f1b452a37ce271a1a97122834468a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/093a651af1b3fa75172eeb5668e9f036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a91649b4cdb115a6d0301b2e9ed4993, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0af1139fd26f1d41df39d1fce11620df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b662f7ff5b9a3337feb5520a4bbd5d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11b538658e3fe7e99ae08c9637c34880, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/121de4d884b40f5b1ef94c065bff60e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1363f21ea2798bef6426ff7d53425ed9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18948851675490046a079ad48ed23cba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/197997f48ecb5f590c122ea359725019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2347582ba12aacb0685678483dcda4d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2df3c10dcfb154378d35eefc77f2acb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3aa83a5f6da6a59403f01ab38e5c8562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45243a2a6483a4910e487e0ef50cd8ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bb0d2e7299737193b5abfd6e7b47974, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bf36f42dd0022ceb9b2f0a4eacae335, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51e0c6cc594b35e84fe445ee11682521, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a41b516057590b3b3b1dcaa6e8054b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b965e29f2eb75642325d4096e27624f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7979aa13371b549688636c8abd469f68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fffe3fcb35545baaf6da1af00ca5650, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8455fa1ef3aa0d13f6ea30ee5fb52167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dc3ba60f7313e09abbf766d5ec1780a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92dc52d1eafdcc33963a26ca877a8b4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93c275792ff746b0e9b266a3ec6c6cb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/984e9289f065deeded9ac6b6e5fa3094, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a156561e0f0f87226e963c200fe823c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3e128dce47812b46e9576d59a03c3e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5823a994f177102c162c03479191d4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b80a5553a8c95eafcb0d0c85b19365d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcdfd1e16a646d8e3ce880d4ecb1bf73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be0727de6246ca5be23362493ce36979, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6a0b5753c40560750926c6551718516, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbf91933c6a7d3de6135247072e7efcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cff53ecacb0f96030a634da10f934054, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5f5e51b172bda70752c9b0307a228a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc08064e0d5f2d4fd82b3adfcdaeae35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc67447cb70f41911b287f3dd6f99a8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df75657acb407043c78c0d44774ac7a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0260a4c46fffd56d3a7a2fc0afd2ddd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee60e147256300bfbd07efad5de3c777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef326f2621fd26f74a06668724b3eaa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f36b3118861bae96e737aacef515b638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9785e6e19fc20ba7eab429eb31480bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fac451035b4130ed93645b82a2cd9cad"

The etiology of this disease is not known. We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the shell gland causing various eggshell abnormalities. In this study, we screened egg layer flocks, in the provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK), with and without a history of SES for the presence of IBV infection. During 2015–2016, a total of 27 egg layer flocks were screened in AB (n = 7) and SK (n = 20). Eighty-one percent of the screened flocks (n = 22) were positive for IBV infection. Thirty of these isolates were successfully characterized using molecular tools targeting the most variable spike (S) 1 gene. IBV isolates from this study clustered into three genotypes based on partial S1 gene variability. The majority of the IBV isolates (70%) were Massachusetts (Mass) type, and the rest were either Connecticut (Conn) type or an uncharacterized genotype with genetic characteristics of Mass and Conn types. Since the majority of the IBV isolates included within the Mass type, we used a Mass type IBV isolate to reproduce SES in specific pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chickens in lay. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether other IBV isolates can cause SES, to clarify the pathogenesis of SES and to develop a vaccine in order to prevent SES as observed in Western Canadian layer flocks.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08e7cd86bcb4983c18a47334cb2a56d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f815ef17f509a854345d686a8144fae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3794134f80e3698a93cafe03c3c1537d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41bdf7421701b95f8e0033e6b9e97b8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/541cd6e5c04eb1327338561765b573c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5504af800dd21e5be89966b9efa1126a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5797150ede3885ce5e680740b53b62df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/630ca8b1f878febeb64f9c32efd3121b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/638e237d0b5a72488c0d3cf9eac53c13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63991b6edd304679fb87378b13cc160f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65b853e043a162d22cb8ab5bc2913c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65f5eac94f7204d2ff8fb3f1fd5b59a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/699620674c2a0cd881be7c4384b3852e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b98ac3cc4c52bb5b44d0234ca9f4bdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d38daacd0359bb5f2295a7cea457125, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e4faf7a08ce2c49f2905e95f0991707, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8041efa0c554bbc3e057d46e0df31216, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81f50767411e3f9581f9559544a69bec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/844142c42ca8b8fd0f6c3812fd13f238, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84db1f5aa02f8bc4886317689fa1f8c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bb51d125a2c7fae553696eb35038ea5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd964f70699f4b515249102165ef64f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92145dc274944edb2f0d5235a7f6e548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95da2915f219542522b87db32406abbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a5bc84ffc2949fe8e493aa7d8f8c777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d4f643b2cd15c9aba5482de9e515c45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a91234b52f66678293d737a275ebcbf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b994068480706199e8bb6457159706c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd187bef8745c7d2af458c00528a6dba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdfc1243b9c33fa5f2175635d166b6b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d8b0a6a33ed50a0ee11df69531654a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6436f03db951f36005c0277f742b016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1066596441f478b9a98d80910288976, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f05b1fcd83684d2e21caeb7651560711, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3f6b22c8b249a68442f5a9248dc81f9"

Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%). Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15b5e20936e2a8c539e1b77627402a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0fe6df94d41953ee6a17bf03acb0c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21a3bceab6807a26b8c2851cb89fa095, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b2fa96e567d62ef5a48230b43093fe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/306334cffe21e889391e1d067744710a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36f80196f8a5f4a527b3dc63708da4f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/393a5b4bcf5fc0bef73b9130e0b98cfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c4357808702ec1b0f16b55863e2bcaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/425ea96181bb840b1f1663bb0d51f207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d2859d1281ffec90f69ca40a3125167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/549df87d015d61123c0b922f8be2e5f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54a410f9b9ef87cac17f979e6bb9fafa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5772836b46aadb72a17431b184d42109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e6218b95762b7fa810ff8c41b573293, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6036278dffc397dfb24af15a64f07170, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/605f5649b9e768d746f50c1910562d8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/643c6067ecd6c330f0d982aa259456a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66d24b5ef2ba75a896d1a61720c9940d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6846d2f53d6181c64b91d6d4f4ab242a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fed68e39f1eaf771d0bda09afe56ff6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/717d682179d3f5a9ab710baeec49f4c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7238be0578013bd869416724ad9dc440, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/752544ca8201a0aaab934f3cf24cded6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a7481a4c7a2657c1f8e8dff4582c4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76848d2e5a16325c6278ed788cd7194f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76c8befd80effb7ee92c1b097c69427e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a207404bb2f201fd72f79e9d24d2afa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cecf9f193835bbffcef8666ad0d7d05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d9579d3c47da3f02b6bc602091fc287, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e10ccbfc32cd115d5adff59e54a8b9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f0580088fe258f82506d9b9678446cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f57a6e5e4c12766fbf4bf532e9d62eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87fdc14278c3d9d6af7807b28153518b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b1ef4f7038942c38575afa6d09d53d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97420d9bec3d5e0fe1cc82b00577088b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9746a1be0c41f1a43ed60b99086b9a48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/989cb5ca03c19c8fe7aed0979c5c1f59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9abc994ceac264c8b3ff021b3be0d7a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cacda4259528fc3171900183927f4a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0478867ca1570782166670701aefb5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2990def499eff00c09e275987e0302b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4d9f58161baa7b67ba464fd83fc34ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aabf14e8b5a8c66ac3b4e59d5fdc3f60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aec213c1b424cd54ae5ae7fa0b2081ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b46dd39177a632a8bf6c07bda455ec4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6a3dcba2e17b18ae88cb1d310743cf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b73c5df855ea0a5008472ea5260b67a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b80e714c3c93611be0997b559d5433f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c3cbbe3c988e71eab1f26638dd10b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb8567bea21ebafb8b9eda5920dfeff4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbd0dff53b7afbb98514a474079c0837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccf100ae2e0a38f532757e6a08715f27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6476a22ec2a4a05b150c91314f41ac0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7ff2fd2b9de5ce487d94a703f998c28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da4af0be84e2bed3fed5a924daf1f01c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db8a8c2d3b62e43cf428c55f94d543f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc0819174791bb0ffa75ca92c3f9e234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5d364b5e5ada76b7b26e9ff319b22d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6cb9be6923f5e6beb68c538cdd02313, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9bded7cf95f585e497d48ec548bc20f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed95e3b4002d31449958e1244a1ea55f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edbf08c77a913cd8d6a3cd7b10183bb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f656ee4460501b13e23200724f42dbdc"

Following intracerebral injection of a neurovirululent strain of influenza A virus into mice, the virus was found to be particularly localized in neurons of the substantia nigra and hippocampus. Although efforts to detect virus particles in the brains, or antibodies in the serum or CSF of patients with PD have been generally unsuccessful, recent immunohistochemical work has revealed the presence of complement proteins and the interferon-induced MxA in association with Lewy bodies and swollen neuronal processes. Although a viral etiology for PD is not now widely accepted, we proposed such an hypothesis. Neurovirulent influenza A virus is a candidate, but some other viruses or complex infection of these viruses may be responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies and the later death of nigral neurons.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1291634115e11a3f5e44ae2cee3cc9fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1843dbf1fcf70c1eaffee72d336a0af0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e2b251fa3966b740fa4b41cd6602d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/329cb53e1802462c3ca0ea0b73192a65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3446703f09d89177cf740367de1005c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/468e97a8b6c9432ccb1eeb487df14533, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ee3dd35b77fade47e26ef8f72081e3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57a856c90ac84628e3c786f022405747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/593503d58d710baa9b5ff39e8c6058bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f0bd9afac4339a7aadc7cc63a1e73a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7105622786965e2ff2a31f0136fa2805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85e429560f3a71a62b1ecc1ffdc04b38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8856ba673657ec9808aa1548118c6d98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8add43d757bb6a411dba6214f3b711d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e3210ebc870bdc0e948dcb3502a44b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a12769921a6e9ccb00f39a184e2f59d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9da0f37e2f931c7ff5d0d07468352a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b40a80f6cc047d4d1b03ef9e52070e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7d1424a73b2ba56e35cbe5a43536107, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8686b2ed47f7ab54f403bb973cdbc90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c49213493a8cc6e471fb3a9b3f342062, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1b679b3c44462c2dcd8fb050d50b5f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2066fa2c5037353242ba400ac35508d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec12a0a90b502058c4eda975aae5c874, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed66fc53570c1859cc972152dbbdd5bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef428556a9ccee54d11e8c30d928a165"

Failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an 'N-call.' This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA. FINDINGS: We analysed 16 patient mtDNA samples using MitoChip. N-calls by the proprietary GSEQ software were significantly reduced when either of the freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi or sPROFILER was utilized. With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c219d8b1123698595963043a9a6dd98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2caa17adc3815aa7dab939b7ec58cfef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37874567ef49e2cac722de65dd8d3512, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b6db2731f23c92a282e5aab30850e27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bbca525e0b0358ea7f139542ed15179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67313523fdffa5317f796df77b7fa9af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/767010ce5c3132f75f5e3a6bceb580bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ebbb5e593a59f07bbde55a855a0c3ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d9b150696ec9f7658eb679948045d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/953414c1a0af68e17192aed2b0bb3ba6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9659b65ea0a5b986d14447ff6a3cb4f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ae667287f03de505ab732fc66a661a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1eee981a843ca28611842a7b0d6a4bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a45a5400ab0089fdb2fb5938cbbc717a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab3a98ec6f74fc2449703712d0a2bfa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba4ccf6faff5b12167a16b382c00c31b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bda4a9566d06a871b8d1e1e6391e3370, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbeba8fc7c280260a5f387d6d7e71c8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9ec6df8d9411b52d3b7ee3e3e379b3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3e0483130619c3328157d44c448e5ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f01b5c7dd82c6e233f49965335966d32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f936094013b99ee9fa903fc8850c827c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c63dd516d24b58de0caf8837b7516d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcf43e756058269d103e56a1451f3481"

We hypothesized that inactivation of the 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase) activity of nsp16 and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein attenuates PEDV yet retains its immunogenicity in pigs. We generated a recombinant PEDV, KDKE(4A), with quadruple alanine substitutions in the catalytic tetrad of the 2′-O-MTase using a virulent infectious cDNA clone, icPC22A, as the backbone. Next, we constructed another mutant, KDKE(4A)-SYA, by abolishing the endocytosis signal of the spike protein of KDKE(4A). Compared with icPC22A, the KDKE(4A) and KDKE(4A)-SYA mutants replicated less efficiently in vitro but induced stronger type I and type III interferon responses. The pathogenesis and immunogenicities of the mutants were evaluated in gnotobiotic piglets. The virulence of KDKE(4A)-SYA and KDKE(4A) was significantly reduced compared with that of icPC22A. Mortality rates were 100%, 17%, and 0% in the icPC22A-, KDKE(4A)-, and KDKE(4A)-SYA-inoculated groups, respectively. At 21 days postinoculation (dpi), all surviving pigs were challenged orally with a high dose of icPC22A. The KDKE(4A)-SYA- and KDKE(4A)-inoculated pigs were protected from the challenge, because no KDKE(4A)-SYA- and one KDKE(4A)-inoculated pig developed diarrhea whereas all the pigs in the mock-inoculated group had severe diarrhea, and 33% of them died. Furthermore, we serially passaged the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant in pigs three times and did not find any reversion of the introduced mutations. The data suggest that KDKE(4A)-SYA may be a PEDV vaccine candidate. IMPORTANCE PEDV is the most economically important porcine enteric viral pathogen and has caused immense economic losses in the pork industries in many countries. Effective and safe vaccines are desperately required but still not available. 2′-O-MTase (nsp16) is highly conserved among coronaviruses (CoVs), and the inactivation of nsp16 in live attenuated vaccines has been attempted for several betacoronaviruses. We show that inactivation of both 2′-O-MTase and the endocytosis signal of the spike protein is an approach to designing a promising live attenuated vaccine for PEDV. The in vivo passaging data also validated the stability of the KDKE(4A)-SYA mutant. KDKE(4A)-SYA warrants further evaluation in sows and their piglets and may be used as a platform for further optimization. Our findings further confirmed that nsp16 can be a universal target for CoV vaccine development and will aid in the development of vaccines against other emerging CoVs.",""

Because individually expressed HA, NA, and M2 proteins are targeted to the apical surface of the cell, guided by apical sorting signals in their transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, it has been proposed that the polarized budding of influenza virions depends on the interaction of nucleocapsids and matrix proteins with the cytoplasmic domains of HA, NA, and/or M2 proteins. Since HA is the major protein component of the viral envelope, its polarized surface delivery may be a major force that drives polarized viral budding. We investigated this hypothesis by infecting MDCK cells with a transfectant influenza virus carrying a mutant form of HA (C560Y) with a basolateral sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain. C560Y HA was expressed nonpolarly on the surface of infected MDCK cells. Interestingly, viral budding remained apical in C560Y virus-infected cells, and so did the location of NP and M1 proteins at late times of infection. These results are consistent with a model in which apical viral budding is a shared function of various viral components rather than a role of the major viral envelope glycoprotein HA.",""

This study is focused on the correlated modulation of gene expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from EV71-infected rhesus monkey infants. The expression of more than 500 functional genes associated with multiple pathways was modulated. The expression of genes associated with immune inflammatory responses was up-regulated during the period from days 4 to 10 post-infection. The expression of two genes (TAC1 and IL17A), which play major roles in inflammatory reactions, was remarkably up-regulated during the infection period. Furthermore, a higher expression level of the TAC1 gene was identified in the CNS compared to the lungs, but a high expression level of the IL-17A gene was observed in the lungs and not in the CNS. The results of this study suggest at least two facts about EV71 infection, which are that: the TAC1 gene that encodes substance P and neurokinin-A is present in both PBMCs and the hypothalamus; and the up-regulation of IL-17A is sustained in the peripheral blood.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0258b88f148b5c9c4d5e0d55a1a0cd06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05b2b30f2a2e61a92cbc95a3aa199718, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05dab329fdb2b4811ff65734e0c02a41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b5dd444056d00c239c16c263d6cf0ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1649835cc6ea90d64210d1b78fe3fe70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21b2929072c922774648916f8b8497e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2936751b4096bb71f6ce8312964563a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/297041fe2e74fe1f1dabf244d9386afd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2af8fa4d1745255bc76ee00f8f70d536, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bc55bfcc505e864080f15533f70895f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3665bc1840dd93ba8eab67a47d7492e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43841ddb68c95aad255697ba562091fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44b743026b94a6c98e8333ed397d6271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4addfa6f26f9546ce855549a2695465c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e6cac9aa4627919bcef72ecf5b9d5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e00d2050c23e8692d278e7b3a3ee59e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fb0dde9c23b9eefdc2ae858a3ec9c54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72de9930db34901be06b430eb559e8f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7834ad39ea17e2e43dc0b755d4e87a4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dd06774bd2cb3f05c2587ee0e5b2e50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e268a3f939775f048c68b38722f9096, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86214d2a710379d3dc879027a7f74239, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ee2dc2386d70e4c2927b76a8ff513e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ee8f94a703d9f106af1e0a3b50387bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab03653179ef5ed091d338599cdc4c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acbac130a6cb3d9890ccdfc258c3b40c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae9868524dfb650bfd8dff1da27cb958, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c02bc5bba7efc3ada1ac02788dd0cb73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce19741eedb8567247b0e0c3d89ba113, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d177a5418dc265b302456fada59e42a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1d25b6a83888c6b92a19fd1b235a12c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbed3f9308aed8d816e81e59da26fcab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e895080a48aedd45715428bf76977f00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e985b83d3a7aee77330fd2bfb689d649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee0cca962368345e4de04307b881f88b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0a284931c7bb54d78f0f9b5f75739e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6b70093a6ffe418f3fe69bb565e8b91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6bef34e0d565c064fb5bb54c0300ed1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7c792bfb3ae62b6bdaa0257dcfbf087, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd701656beac1f9fb0778aee6e1150a7"

Here, we first summarize previous studies on the codon-reading properties of tRNA molecules with a U derivative at the wobble position. Then, we propose a hypothetical mechanism of the reading of the G-ending codons by such tRNA molecules that could explain the experimental results.

However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

Experimental evidences were provided for memory maintenance through anti-idiotypic antibody (Ab2) carrying the internal image of the antigen. In the present work, we describe a structural basis for such memory perpetuation by molecular modeling and structural analysis studies. A three-dimensional model of Ab2 was generated and the structure of the antigenic site on the hemagglutinin protein H of Rinderpest virus was modeled using the structural template of hemagglutinin protein of Measles virus. Our results show that a large portion of heavy chain containing the CDR regions of Ab2 resembles the domain of the hemagglutinin housing the epitope regions. The similarity demonstrates that an internal image of the H antigen is formed in Ab2, which provides a structural basis for functional mimicry demonstrated earlier. This work brings out the importance of the structural similarity between a domain of hemagglutinin protein to that of its corresponding Ab2. It provides evidence that Ab2 is indeed capable of functioning as surrogate antigen and provides support to earlier proposed relay hypothesis which has provided a mechanism for the maintenance of immunological memory.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f66e3a63cdb687b7ca97c94f3313008, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26d6ca4454a9967f2d2cc90f69a58d07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bee2b71d658fc1bf553a60bc88c2c56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f1c433d3e1451705eb4a7b6d647ac99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42abd77f4e8a5c663bfc5b52c77b07e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/446c39ad7c4dacdd1ef4d4adb521440c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e3f5191756b4cde969e9fbdf205da40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5360a1012a199dfb26b9ad242c217c14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/672f610c3ec5388ebb056e4b63deae69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78114c47d1805026b101d8c8b56d0722, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7863e7b0c34b60739ac3c32b46c050a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8504795dd1fc472b9b8bf35ab2a7ae2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/884b274b8b16b672e91ed2a6ccbba8e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d7ba106fcbb4bb56a7049b746c40afd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98c15bb6df77010826799cd123800f7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9df8cee68912becbb7bb085b986d2b6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fdd712789f6f945023e10d04b3349cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b831e4a64795f57ccb90282b6dc907ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8dbf7df1fd2d884089c8ccdc904c207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd35eda70446a3766f6089993b90b292, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdfcb0dc214f48be0d8c0c4879972812, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf3641b5f72ea2839838d1952b64da32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e01fba5ed2f51cefb1cb0ed441401693, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0e43aed011f03569aca7c4e126136ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f73dbd7febeaf6b22ffd850fec28c17a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbef568d23e6cafc44564fd7bb1ae87c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc2516bc2ebb02327d6068db96731d81"

Previous studies have documented the emergence of recombinants over the last 20 years, with the most recent one, Ck/Aus/N1/08, detected in 2008. These recombinants did not appear to be controlled by the vaccines currently in use. In this study we sequenced the complete genomes of three emergent Australian strains of IBV (IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/88, IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/03 and IBV/Ck/Aus/N1/08) and a previously incompletely characterised vaccine strain, IBV/Ck/Aus/Armidale, and compared them to the genome of the vaccine strain VicS. We detected multiple recombination events throughout the genome between wild type viruses and the vaccine strains in all three emergent isolates. Moreover, we found that strain N1/88 was not entirely exogenous, as was previously hypothesised. Rather, it originated from a recombination event involving the VicS vaccine strain. The S glycoprotein genes of N1/88 and N1/03 were known to be genetically distinct from previously characterised circulating strains and from each other, and the original donors of these genes remains unknown. The S1 glycoprotein gene of N1/88, a subgroup 2 strain, shares a high nucleotide identity with the sequence of the S1 gene of the recent isolate N1/08. As the subgroup 2 strains have not been isolated for at least 20 years, it appears likely that an unknown avian coronavirus that was the donor of the S1 glycoprotein sequence of N1/88 in the 1980s is still recombining with IBV strains in the field.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1783d7e81479b3c813a88992f18ffd18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bdcfa5f49c9a8f8be70188cd85f1876, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7690a936ab25174602e27c6026813857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5109506df6c368283760fe3e8ca77ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8e051d02162a06972a22ca606e9751a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee608c93b8c9ded89e44736561abf1b0"

Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.",""

Sequence analysis of the 70 nucleotide region between open reading frames 1a and 1b indicates the presence of a shifty heptamer consensus sequence and downstream sequences that may be needed for ribosomal frameshifting. We constructed four astrovirus cassettes that spanned this region and inserted each into the rhesus rotavirus VP4 gene. The constructs were expressed in an in vitro system, and products were immunoprecipitated by rotavirus amino and carboxy terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies. Ribosomal frameshifting, at an efficiency of 6–7%, was demonstrated in all constructs containing the shifty heptamer and stem-loop. Deletion of the downstream sequence potentially involved in pseudoknot formation did not affect frameshifting efficiency. However, deletion of the shifty heptamer resulted in no detectable frameshift activity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/208713a9d685fd1c8621bc61c1160557, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2263c3b954fa2b3940ca8456cb560bfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29d6b5228fa8ccb8ea86c4fe253c4c7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37c5d53e8f33f36bab0fa65dfbffeb9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fbbf4339310b7d14cc6c568ac410ee8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cac1edb90d72c2b884d6c440a30ee00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8378b9a276dd42f8c87a036ae8f2c9b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c7bc512ada3c872e540c441f80520a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99ff155ff3b86613c49fc775c2f82039, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a309a185d330eb8252748ffc93982d3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a398eafa3d4f04f3f3d2f4a6364b62be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a50f0fbeed43a7972b7d4b97ed462d47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a933a4be0148033d254d6e81dfcda442, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab75040057b66ffe29be0f28116db023, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ada7d39e127bb400c2af21b76ec6c74c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc98250d9852bedb8c3fc3017ad9f8d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de3dd2db6c7cf12ef961d10a636269a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df207ac127b4da365362a0cc20a5c9a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1b18b17099cb22435be5b125e33e7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3714ca7ac6c6e5acb9e4f3a5b8f5ce5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9e73212c62c33503c0df11b494db27b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef7a857ddc1aeaf754ee69547ae5713e"

Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism in the liver by HCV-encoded proteins during viral infection creates a favorable environment for virus propagation and pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs). One such master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways is the host subtilisin/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) – or site-1 protease (S1P). SKI-1/S1P plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which control expression of the key enzymes of cholesterol and fatty-acid biosynthesis. Here we report the development of a SKI-1/S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor and its application to blocking the SREBP signaling cascade. We demonstrate that SKI-1/S1P inhibition effectively blocks HCV from establishing infection in hepatoma cells. The inhibitory mechanism is associated with a dramatic reduction in the abundance of neutral lipids, LDs, and the LD marker: adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)/perilipin 2. Reduction of LD formation inhibits virus assembly from infected cells. Importantly, we confirm that SKI-1/S1P is a key host factor for HCV infection by using a specific active, site-directed, small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P: PF-429242. Our studies identify SKI-1/S1P as both a novel regulator of the HCV lifecycle and as a potential host-directed therapeutic target against HCV infection and liver steatosis. With identification of an increasing number of human viruses that use host LDs for infection, our results suggest that SKI-1/S1P inhibitors may allow development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals that could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral options with the current standard of care.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03eb764332ccfe0a072885d77b0b58b3,

Culling-induced social perturbation of badger populations may lead to unexpected outcomes. We test predictions from the ‘perturbation hypothesis’, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Culling operations did not remove all individuals from setts, with between 34–43% of badgers removed from targeted social groups. After culling, bTB prevalence increased in badger social groups neighbouring removals, particularly amongst cubs. Seventy individual adult badgers were fitted with radio-collars, yielding 8,311 locational fixes from both sites between November 2001 and December 2003. Home range areas of animals surviving within removed groups increased by 43.5% in response to culling. Overlap between summer ranges of individuals from Neighbouring social groups in the treatment population increased by 73.3% in response to culling. The movement rate of individuals between social groups was low, but increased after culling, in Removed and Neighbouring social groups. Increased bTB prevalence in Neighbouring groups was associated with badger movements both into and out of these groups, although none of the moving individuals themselves tested positive for bTB. Significant increases in both the frequency of individual badger movements between groups and the emergence of bTB were observed in response to culling. However, no direct evidence was found to link the two phenomena. We hypothesise that the social disruption caused by culling may not only increase direct contact and thus disease transmission between surviving badgers, but may also increase social stress within the surviving population, causing immunosuppression and enhancing the expression of disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00fb5697a4a20e9f56922f27e10c438c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0aa84ca212f8437ee74cbc1db252846c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/105559217d6eb8418d2c6cfee0de2769, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/155282b4f58cd96873c8f24d408a0afc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29bd99b4a260977adebe49f3d36e13ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/449545430241c24838bc6cf8ff076de1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45ad8b608ff61fd1c3377e33075c6ece, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4901fdbe38ab778950ecdecd55079f20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fd72b2c80f3236d91d8bb3b8d2d31a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/587287bbce3f256523a93ad4f8ee565e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59e0ea4a0e02e5396133ba03bddb83e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ffb629ab432358362451f5a252db562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64e206239018586c5750f5418d6aa874, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7094549398f4e90e067a1037bb5f3b1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e6cb49ee2cfd9e8fd3841ba5a0853b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81517d953676ca4c697c558e1881a80b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98d866543232c77a63c6d0362aadbaf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a48191edd2c2c72ba9e0c1b4e98dc02a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9e99af2703017b3f0c0def82a3c1cb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad34ec3cc84ae93cf666ff0cbedf50cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b520626c2d7e06b9ebc8b6839ad48a89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2a77e17473679a8ef74bfc4a75a9f77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4e3d79680e02119dd848f0192e88463, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4f720e11de92c91799f145b1cad34fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d59ace4456d9d22c17a59f2350006583, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6609ac1d536e57ad9e567d71268c8a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f20847b147f678a48ba5e75f1b2b86ad"

Sensitive and robust techniques are needed to quantify proteolytic activities within the complex biological milieu. We hypothesized that a combinatorial protease substrate library could be used effectively to identify similarities and differences between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), two body fluids that are clinically important for developing targeted therapies and diagnostics. We used a concise library of fluorogenic probes to map the protease substrate specificities of serum and BALF from guinea pigs. Differences in the proteolytic fingerprints of the two fluids were striking: serum proteases cleaved substrates containing cationic residues and proline, whereas BALF proteases cleaved substrates containing aliphatic and aromatic residues. Notably, cleavage of proline-containing substrates dominated all other protease activities in both human and guinea pig serum. This substrate profiling approach provides a foundation for quantitative comparisons of protease specificities between complex biological samples.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04a125ead24e7a7bf9fe21e477bb90e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0da597437a64d7fd61e70350e6b980f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12af06c536b9777b9189d78e0dfef52b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e3577e4828c9b0ce98d18c3ec92f91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29d6729727b5087c29e3e74d54dc3b98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2af72243f70418643030028383c4d6f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e7ea4bcac4698984e39b514f9c5051f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34b27a22e8e379996de3bf90fa4a5a55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3931aaeb1bcda1a69f064408aa71dfc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43d557f87f8acc18ea0af24fa86f7cec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/457ebcb0fe835651ea99b3f16b4df467, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49d149d77bfb7442ec2077a0c1b76c68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5638f0942033599be72f85084f5c3e52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59298434eef3fba0b86059ec74380744, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5abb5e7c413efd9db33252cf01fd1006, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7062b31a7592f6594f138c9733b059ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78793dc0fb2c698fe11a71d98bcb4a4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d704fa5bbb1eee9ad9dcc7fa906d45c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d97f0c5c429269ef1fa78e90c24033, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/891ae234f55e54327fad3551ab192d56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/902931168c51a4e5987ca53a1754994a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9165f8a28af6898b16d805f5ade02c7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a103df0ff8822f935a889bb5ea4bb7ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad885c1f059ff15bf891cbbea9eabcd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bee5357ac76c5aed751acaa7341b1102, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bff4bba3ff23ee50642e61db76ea6282, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c261b60a3f3ef73ad29ce3fce9c15856, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdc7d2c995bef5f671f9fce5c12b72c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce440b23a321fd7babf08b4f4364948d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4b73a4637e316a0984fde441dac8244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9e46cf6ca811864adebb79f2609db56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db85d9d69cd5bf68ab22aca7a6fc350b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e61df1f110fe3854ef48280d6d075589, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed427ab7cac5d18dedae5cb228b527b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa0ea6738831e76a18b757e6bce5f370"

OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to test the following hypotheses: stigma and hardiness exert both direct effects on mental health and also indirect (mediated) effects on mental health through stress in nurses working at a government-designated hospital during a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic. METHODS A total of 187 participants were recruited using a convenience sampling method. The direct and indirect effects related to the study hypotheses were computed using a series of ordinary least-squares regressions and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals with 10,000 bootstrap resamples from the data. DISCUSSIONS The influences of stigma and hardiness on mental health were partially mediated through stress in nurses working at a hospital during a MERS-CoV epidemic. Their mental health was influenced more by direct effects than by indirect effects.",""

However, the elicitation of b12 or b12-like antibodies in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. B12 is highly divergent from the closest corresponding germline antibody while X5 is less divergent. We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation. In support of this hypothesis we have previously found that a germline-like b12 (monovalent and bivalent scFv as an Fc fusion protein or IgG) lacks measurable binding to an Env as measured by ELISA with a sensitivity in the μM range [1]; here we present evidence confirming and expanding these findings for a panel of Envs. In contrast, a germline-like scFv X5 bound Env with high (nM) affinity. To begin to explore the maturation pathways of these antibodies we identified several possible b12 intermediate antibodies and tested their neutralizing activity. These intermediate antibodies neutralized only some HIV-1 isolates and with relatively weak potency. In contrast, germline-like scFv X5 neutralized a subset of the tested HIV-1 isolates with comparable efficiencies to that of the mature X5. These results could help explain the relatively high immunogenicity of the coreceptor binding site on gp120 and the abundance of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients (X5 is a CD4i antibody) as well as the maturation pathway of X5. They also can help identify antigens that can bind specifically to b12 germline and intermediate antibodies that together with Envs could be used as a conceptually novel type of candidate vaccines. Such candidate vaccines based on two or more immunogens could help guiding the immune system through complex maturation pathways for elicitation of antibodies that are similar or identical to antibodies with known properties.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04b43265d097ef49381e16026e7b17f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/182d6dc769f057215d316150e0e9d888, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f72f1f767afdea308bf12c285c46151, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b256bc207e67d36eb3977df21f738c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e7cc493a1fc7021541c309112629ce0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f4d08dd53f9032d652b04927c036c5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3374767a5482fefd54d3a30ba6e634f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bac98e7d40f9e12a8444863ed00f37e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bc9176193606344e9d91bfbc0cb55de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cc6210b6737c27f41b110b47e3cf720, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42fff9203bf6e8ab1af3b2afd0ec0bae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/462bb8b669955f72a8abe125c675a83a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e42f1ed907e9f6ec624bf77f3b5b41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fda506cf1a1e1b3a01f5c693f7160a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63f1fd70b48e09bae1cb95f315381c3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/755ec0b8d246e9aa434e3ac54e69f657, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a24756b13ffb74ff7203359a9dec2cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c0423d02663cbdf160cf869b05f6789, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88f09597484850bf631abc434d7e3c13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9118e5648eb14cc9bcb2b86a98fdd0b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9855d7f511b7855329a2b847b28800ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99ebaf3b3f010b4da273541762670ac3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ada939abd54f42941168f25cea20d44d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aea54f36b90fc76d62649555e028d3c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6cff12b09d6d74530f1cac610df439e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7c07f8b5435778265cea3b04183635c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c345e5b232de8fe73f7e872db135a05e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d06b439ac107a978f4afa0e6f53a7f4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc6746acf7f40f76b5153a7e980a5427, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb37a12c9f62e2f7ca60420ef7d6f67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e94389c7d2ba15e9a5d1316cbd542752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea020a44e60f6bfa22aa43a764a13a08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edc52fafabb4b199900f2af02b6d0e51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f44b2f521683b0c212008d5109ff9b19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5d9d78654a84ad62663f34b4893ab7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f73135a24e367ccc000e1bd4e495934b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f87d8b28b3b11cc894692c2313058ce4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f99eb42794f42d43f19a64d53d5778e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffec0042500785a16aceb5a914b299fe"

For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten “challenge” are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs’ range of 15–25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a “grey zone” of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ac9e68aba054267aabde6903447251c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/109e83d02f936200eea8808804e4a6c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/193d98d5577a74101852e1f952630a2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/252f0d1125083c3ee94053d109a46d4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/294070c5f5008764891d1949877ba914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ce11766004f9acf68a0f3cefb3e8743, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32311c91d093583a6d33f44a323bd2bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c7512a699698dc472fa57a57caf0dee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/528d95a1b41884b99c31f7b396ccece6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55962dff616afef012319d884c9a6906, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57895887048d68fb0982d396dadf2ded, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/592bd814ff8c3ea84d89dcd3baae6129, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71449045a47afdc53b9b9566b4de8e00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91eb0ac4da0c3d2bf7a971180e2eeeb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9538e001821abe2783710e88d4606953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a049346234250d977a75a7107640774d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a485e2197f6adb738f4a4f64c179d306, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2ea954028c5fa5af2b700b421e66cf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4b6e8d0639ba5ce7fdfa9819c9d87ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7b7f036e183eb1842babbb66ebf6ff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be7e2a40654e78ca25ebc1dea8d8f399, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c72325b405a7ab12f749f59c91a82c37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1118857bf9a58b729acf7a3fe6bb1f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d29644d445835a704a7879517bd02b5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de50be7e99520b7775c58be8a6f5044e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0aab550abc289d160cd99c6b263f9c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eac1264dab0affa9f45d7b692cbb3f18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb3a7825627a2defb30607e33a3efd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3203196f8a2c5c8d5431f04a290fe55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f44ce4f6e945c2aa529f5797a55a814f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4a9a1397bcd2fdca7da1bee3536d126, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa2dcadd7b8a0dd079de71dd066b6400, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa3ed4f7746b5f6e3c94927e2564a019"

Our understanding of viral diversity derives primarily from comparisons among host species, precluding insight into how intraspecific variation in host ecology affects viral communities or how predictable viral communities are across populations. Here we test spatial, demographic and environmental hypotheses explaining viral richness and community composition across populations of common vampire bats, which occur in diverse habitats of North, Central and South America. We demonstrate marked variation in viral communities that was not consistently predicted by a null model of declining community similarity with increasing spatial or genetic distances separating populations. We also find no evidence that larger bat colonies host greater viral diversity. Instead, viral diversity follows an elevational gradient, is enriched by juvenile‐biased age structure, and declines with local anthropogenic food resources as measured by livestock density. Our results establish the value of linking the modern influx of metagenomic sequence data with comparative ecology, reveal that snapshot views of viral diversity are unlikely to be representative at the species level, and affirm existing ecological theories that link host ecology not only to single pathogen dynamics but also to viral communities.",""

Although previous studies have reported that α-/θ-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are under birth-and-death evolution with frequent duplication and rapid evolution, the phylogenetic relationships of the primate DEFA/DEFT genes; the genetic bases for the existence of similar antimicrobial spectra among closely related species; and the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic θ-defensins in Old World monkeys and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require further investigation. In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid α-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8. The prosegment of θ-defensin is detected with adaptive changes coevolving with the new protein fold of mature peptide, coincident with the importance of the prosegment for the correct folding of the mature peptide. Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/014da6975a435123b02de65667031fb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/051cd032f7e97621bc1c70167453f383, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/105833f2ea8749dba1a0f7a73d1e7e96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1336c7d4deb0ca8a580fc731dd183fe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/178fd36c8084d28d4acc81ab31d08ada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23e14c9407dbe5c3d328c2e34ed92ae7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/259fe30afacbd480a065e30742109256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25cab677e30f1d327e5b4adf59523ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/267049d81e20bc309fa5d55418e5834a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34dedf4fe7a2e6b6dae5cebccf745a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37140b373ae3fb5dd62e88f243b2f22d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/472a93e6d15bc8b545787885f8b5fe9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/518bb30d2c402ee1553bc7de3569a591, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53c409bd47f9c271fa306dbb8325bba4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5937128050371fbe6a7c69d51495e317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5991b397d0ce0fc0461f5dd0f7d35c30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b84591a7ed9aee60f1ec22a5e4e980c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5df45c2565eb0f1517e8d09e21d16704, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62141aa81d8765157ab30a612fea011c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/649317f6a66f6f9dd06429ec52641b38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64aab06b0fc109c7965abd54ed656f09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bd0c25c5695153ec6774a7012c64116, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fe56dda5419336d48714eae34d51047, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7865e2d6aefd59ca8a5f90e8edcd3a2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79993c1e54f94e6bbd7bff6a967dd97e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85cd1163a40105f7f52c96205642d02f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a833f56aea6f47644a39a5ec70ee8b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93b6dab4499f2ceb7bd2438f41f6bb3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95f902f85a4113bf8bbf9e3be98e1ef6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/997a74fcca9dd44278a673f69fd1afe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dec2832c07ed544b29325fd42218724, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a25ee0dc2489d731c7f25a491159669a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3e8dc8f25fa3908ff2b5d7a31a0f05a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6f845716bdf5f0c3dc06eb5b455b37e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9b5d7da61f7cd7f479a65ccae350505, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b16600f47e3d20443eca47c9785e7354, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b534561de97db8a4ae24b143b1cdf8b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b547edd7d52af04b68c59f6c0aca3843, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ae220761f4d9548cb8536d05fbc4c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c164f81fe843e0dc99921e0e0b7cf2bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b387345806e26e625fd4f0948d08a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3fca694571cb5e5ef0da6574a9291df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8d7b23c50b672411cd75b313f104c70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca3360d8d716b09f9534bfab21bd115d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc0a4f15e91480a8afd1c773742ebca9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1792e60a63a98992e87485ffcf534fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2bf91b73d5ad4d974ee2318f3c2384d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6a44221ee49d67cda8d2e0ebe9bde0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5e202556aee4f7de8dea9962b75c075, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9994dd66c202fe2849cb8ecb2aeee13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec9a3f48857253dbbb6678c382911f38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecc8cf19a4265e550b00f3ade3d7ce52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f47811c48b7688db05849c588d79e52b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffb004bc7feecc6cf995db55d01280a6"

Pathological changes in the bladder developed during PBOO are responsible for long-lasting voiding dysfunction in this population despite early surgical interventions. Increasing evidence showed PBOO induces an upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and their transcriptional target genes, and they play a role in pathophysiological changes in the obstructed bladders. We hypothesized that blocking HIF pathways can prevent PBOO-induced bladder dysfunction. PBOO was surgically created by ligation of the bladder neck in male C57BL/6J mice for 2 wk. PBOO mice received intraperitoneal injection of either saline or 17-DMAG (alvespimycin, 3 mg/kg) every 48 h starting from day 1 postsurgery. Sham-operated animals received injection of saline on the same schedule as PBOO mice and served as controls. The bladders were harvested after 2 wk, and basal activity and evoked contractility of the detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) were evaluated in vitro. Bladder function was assessed in vivo by void spot assay and cystometry in conscious, unrestrained mice. Results indicated the 17-DMAG treatment preserved DSM contractility and partially prevented the development of detrusor over activity in obstructed bladders. In addition, PBOO caused a significant increase in the frequency of micturition, which was significantly reduced by 17-DMAG treatment. The 17-DMAG treatment improved urodynamic parameters, including increases in the bladder pressure at micturition and nonvoid contractions observed in PBOO mice. These results demonstrate that treatment with 17-DMAG, a HIF inhibitor, significantly alleviated PBOO-induced bladder pathology in vivo.",""

Based on the ability of CEACAM1 to initiate lumen formation in human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D culture (Matrigel), we hypothesized that murine CEACAM1 may play a similar role in vasculogenesis. In order to test this hypothesis, murine embryonic stem (ES) cells stimulated with VEGF were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EB) for 8 days (−8–0 d) and transferred to Matrigel in the presence or absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody for an additional 12 days (0–12 d). In the absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody or in the presence of an isotype control antibody, the EB in Matrigel underwent extensive sprouting, generating lengthy vascular structures with well-defined lumina as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. Both the length and architecture of the vascular tubes were inhibited by anti-CEACAM1 mAb CC1, a mAb that blocks the cell–cell adhesion functions of CEACAM1, thus demonstrating a critical role for this cell–cell adhesion molecule in generating and maintaining vasculogenesis. QRT–PCR analysis of the VEGF treated ES cells grown under conditions that convert them to EB revealed expression of Ceacam1 as early as −5 to −3 d reaching a maximum at day 0 at which time EBs were transferred to Matrigel, thereafter levels at first declined and then increased over time. Other markers of vasculogenesis including Pecam1, VE-Cad, and Tie-1 were not detected until day 0 when EBs were transferred to Matrigel followed by a steady increase in levels, indicating later roles in vasculogenesis. In contrast, Tie-2 and Flk-1 (VEGFR2) were detected on day five of EB formation reaching a maximum at day 0 on transfer to Matrigel, similar to Ceacam1, but after which Tie-2 declined over time, while Flk-1 increased over time. QRT–PCR analysis of the anti-CEACAM1 treated ES cells revealed a significant decrease in the expression of Ceacam1, Pecam1, Tie-1, and Flk-1, while VE-Cad and Tie-2 expression were unaffected. These results suggest that the expression and signaling of CEACAM1 may affect the expression of other factors known to play critical roles in vasculogenesis. Furthermore this 3D model of vasculogenesis in an environment of extracellular matrix may be a useful model for comparison to existing models of angiogenesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01e81e2d768a150b8f1b35f39464a47d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/081824f59f94458cc96030f6b17e7f02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a1f6ab011813aee0c87b50166252396, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10cd0e275cbc3ceedef7b1888a73800b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10d920ff2f61b7f1b5a65706a3ebd86a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11d4f66fbf9c743e1b7ddff831906f33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16f45d94d7512475c294fdfec5cfee9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b9036d28c450269b650ccc74c9f494b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c9ffd4cdd663269a97043f9327582b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2340269ed5fdf77448a40fac9d52a33d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26c5c8eddaca28cd05dcfc062f0666fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28443630f59320c0f73848f95d2b000c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a078c10f1729e2c783ca9bf6941d79d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36fc91c9e4437a852ef79e5ecd7598f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/384c6cc809632c4f50b6d5404febce5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d50962f5ffe345de209e19bfabe6a8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/432803e524ee4334ff9ea0cbe9a8de63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/488b194edb95db9f6f66ab02d3170542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d60c176075399f4be5f843610f4ff0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e32dfabcd3d42693f56d7d1a6a158a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e7789a24d76a2b44c038551f9080290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58bad6aa30bc1a71a2d8bcffa0c4086a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/592c801f192e12342139ca11c97ab7a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6daa4c320edd51a8af085e724d230cae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ecae9ac0b46f7c37778ad015446e499, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71f48530dc702a455ce1fb6a16916ff4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76db29981428c694f17f58b97cbe61a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a2c3f3dfac4bb30fc83b45e58cf50e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c93b89276b26f3afe45488ca757645f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e202677aab04692035dce7dde1c5d4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/813d39b7ffd289c6b571b4bfb3f221b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b7a4cd721b1aab8dfdda9094b2c2464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c368385ac8e0cd48f1ae632eb4655cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e032ba98c2a0d762ba874cdfffab100, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93888fe6d337dacc698a241ff61a7161, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a16942627bd123d0491ca3f53a51d7d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3129aeefb67353c2b233120538eb393, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3f48c91407e9023f47d5416e3bda0be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4398550b38447345334f39ea19adbc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a805a2fedf7b3f3312cd7d26ac9c072d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a88bcd0953387c321e5ba65e0e5aa4b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa98e8ba4349597208d07f1602ef307b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeb5a5544dcee2c53795b8ee6f7c9de2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1291102f8c3084f4a072a8cdbff9ee0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3852ec94ee7441c585a05bcfe391054, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b58b403e72028e725080e9bf6af3a70e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b93f753518fec6a1dde065c70bb937fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdc35d76e930d9e6b2291aa4a0145fac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c307c7efeb534d7390f1f552be790bd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c44b2f2b2084ee6d8a6170565e48b160, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4948a97c307c2169759cb26d8152510, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c62c5671905a69ce73c5e1ccdf79c8d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb37fc55274c8c49f27d15b47334afc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd62dec55c2d4fa44794ba103416807a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd90bff7683ec2e06b43bf9234e96c5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0b68dc79f6216ceb65629dc68de34d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2d280a0137dc04d0bcc26b260fe6040, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4e2e6dad43502a236dd7bfc61b1188c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8a753c0e552e8eb42dab4bca28a3217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e28edb97d021e8ca0ab0155213ce1cb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7b72f235b2a4e895898fb7582e01871, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eabbab8aa9d1d4e0ca45a42d1ef35c3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef0f6f7be68a5c47c83090b0516bece3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f75b5e118469b815b214a9a09762f41f"

FCoV exhibits 2 biotypes: the pathogenic disease and a benign infection with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Uncertainty remains regarding whether genetically distinctive avirulent and virulent forms coexist or whether an avirulent form mutates in vivo, causing FIP. To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Viral sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and nonstructural protein 7b genes. These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations. In addition, 5 membrane protein amino acid residues with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with FIP. These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent FIP-associated FCoV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11ef15d01ec8424625185603d9f76c7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/186870d47e22f099149321cc085a16bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c298e7811735b07c47dde79c8fbc5b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c8999b62c834eaa1a05ae772783729f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27a3cb3a0d20f18cdfec654f4847aea2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d685aa7bde455bb9a5e218d920b4e11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33ec4de71d3598bc8e9d52034944df81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36f92c615180ca39ee097d87dd37bd31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a0f3a10137e0dd9ac3004fe4f3e6189, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45c4d3f4dc88fe18a52e81ee9d4a55e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4aabeccc98e4dc8887c312fe9ba0db51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b93d55f33b13e91e205663f9d460a1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c577526ab13b8470420ef8eb1054132, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fef8c924fd8aba8fa332358535411e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63abb348d5af88727496e644b020eaa5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74f457719bafc63c160226ec3a7d40e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b9680081fe545876e600c7c83e68b1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8463904f659b6bc77d8ceadd8a222d67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89e9c24ac02469d76c25e449e7010220, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e7a4bc76a5b67669c6fb588d9bbe52b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dc56fbafb4e007af19d003a5dfaf434, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a19448056137e27e71107a4f72667bc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8ad335e20a8a835a46a693a49a0fbe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c05edb77a5a3a58adbe5aa152f10cfed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4d56b282b41f735311b29a10d9fda1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c592d1d59b39d0a6607f456fc7eb754e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb1932937e40450317cc175262cfc59e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdcfe01d514bcc1c5c0d5448e150da70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dba7783d772746a8ff57ff57d2a73bf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9cd59771a7ea1ece45b837b95430286"

The placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. We hypothesised that exposure of peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) to syncytin-1 would impair responses to H1N1pdm09 influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recombinant syncytin-1 was produced. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the presence and absence of syncytin-1 and compared to responses of PBMCs from pregnant women (n=12). PBMCs were characterised using flow cytometry, release of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-λ, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β were measured by cytometric bead array or ELISA. Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-α, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN-λ (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours. This was significantly impaired in pregnant women (IFN-α; p<0.0001 and IFN-λ; p<0.001). Furthermore, in the presence of syncytin-1, PBMCs demonstrated marked reductions in IFN-α and IFN-λ, while enhanced release of IL-10 as well as IL-6 and IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that a placental derived protein, syncytin-1 may be responsible for the heightened vulnerability of pregnant women to influenza.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c21ab9a259088806aa5697c0cafc204, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f46ebb517492c05f9e3888615ab5790, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61a5ab96d1b4a442a716f0c4137eb85b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75707b66d07ac6de633912627416970d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/808b0f19600a8106daba93243dcf8139, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87c8346ba57a08cb7087f2d51ce316c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab45935012d6b165d35f36d41045f873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b067ef18a6832e74f5699924b71a52ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3c39911fed5339ac6a5e39539cab1f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4100d226db66fdd426474f007f8899e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d25cdd1381939840877dc034821735c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3fd523773e4cf9ad38f83fb60ba1e43"

There are four genetically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization titers varied by as much as ∼19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/004a9fb2917aba265e0f3ea2d5f79841, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0130255a3a3d21a23a30be901ec239b1,

The model used field data in eastern Hokkaido where the risk of BVDV infection in cattle has been reduced by an eradication program including mass vaccination, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing, herd screening tests using bulk milk, and outbreak investigations of newly infected herds. These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds. When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests. Considering the model outputs together, the scenario tree model developed in the present study was useful to compare the efficacy of the control measures for BVD.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/016a1c674dc55276234c722ba5ce8734, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/067c70ce48a9d87b0334f7b347488f1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1363252c3609f91fd15ce567ff83f3e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/144e885ab7187df56b721750de471c4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2adf7f1118f7e8b5b3807fe00e6709e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34de6a46c521df1edf53c82dee557bef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42a1ce8e15922d479b0c17b5985f86a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50f74f986f8754d946024c87148ccd81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5685db500a68c15e7fea752c51c82730, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e3af2a623f04067d24658290ff1c136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f87a21a9af332a74cdcfe0abb76b15a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60599b8c79e432c776a16c133435da66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67cd0301dacdc5ad0c4f880bda3577f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7164d8887abe1b9a1896e43a7107bb41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7567e64ff175ee6960fc67ffa73ecd0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7628b6eec6d30520b316996b00310a1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8120ca8e6e90476bc7ce2153e8f9012c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/958182bc12ca53b162c2fe649ad39bf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97e506e925939d39d677a8ad337f2d31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9945a1758f9a7d3ac5e6e7af9eb81b26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c37ce3223438a38fc70b0ca08c2a5ce4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4fd79eff9f7535070ce6bd852c27e60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8e2e383a993928d13e6551fea830a5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd4f712dc69980a6a6b30078b6d8955b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdc3515c3f57880a7192aec8e3f9d98b"

The removal of ubiquitin from innate immunity signaling factors by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) therefore provides a potential opportunity for viruses to evade this host defense system. It was previously found that specific proteases encoded by the unrelated arteri- and nairoviruses resemble the ovarian tumor domain-containing (OTU) family of DUBs. In arteriviruses, this domain has been characterized before as a papain-like protease (PLP2) that is also involved in replicase polyprotein processing. In nairoviruses, the DUB resides in the polymerase protein but is not essential for RNA replication. Using both in vitro and cell-based assays, we now show that PLP2 DUB activity is conserved in all members of the arterivirus family and that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling when overexpressed. The potential relevance of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling for the innate immune response against arterivirus infection is supported by our finding that in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the production of beta interferon primarily depends on the recognition of arterivirus RNA by the pattern-recognition receptor MDA5. Interestingly, we also found that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I ubiquitination upon overexpression, suggesting that both MDA5 and RIG-I have a role in countering infection by arteriviruses. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that arteri- and nairoviruses employ their deubiquitinating potential to inactivate cellular proteins involved in RLR-mediated innate immune signaling, as exemplified by the deubiquitination of RIG-I.",""

We hypothesized that variations in the incidence of NEC were random, without clustering. In order to define the pattern of NEC in the United States, we analyzed the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to evaluate whether NEC cases are distributed randomly or exhibit temporal clustering or periodicity. METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we queried the PHIS database for all patients with NEC (ICD-9 code of 777.5) over a 13-year period. Sixteen children’s hospitals were studied, and individual institutional and aggregate data were reviewed. Fisher’s Kappa and Bartlett’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to identify periodicity. RESULTS: During the study interval, there were 2,93,076 neonatal admissions, and 4,559 (1.6%) infants were diagnosed with NEC. Statistical analysis demonstrates a periodicity of 6 months in the occurrence of NEC. Fisher’s Kappa was 16.924 and Bartlett’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov was 0.281, which translates to a P value of <0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a national database analysis it appears a temporally non-random distribution of NEC cases does exist.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/266cc9367f72cb0657a9432f34b5e060, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a0447b1fc9b87367c0622c4b11a4930, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/318fc3eb4d291440712c038e4fa7faf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3429e2c720f97efd5884098ce12c52d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a37d51704d757ce42a249405b78462d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42dd599a2a6a30c9f4a432c305ad1abc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/499e93ae72fc2b8ec2b9a463376da7e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e87f0bb61c4822685050db5768ec93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57b8cd9b63230b32ac8286d9de8dcfe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cadb32bad2acd514b3bfacaac0a633e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/848afc34611efc5c2091986599580ac3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8763474853f70b0033a179e5dad606f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d8dad56d849237dd590f6f69d14bc4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90667c1f33ce927551533f6338174b2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98ffbe26d8421b0b9ceabd6e56af9104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cc88dbaeae967a67c9c9703832df914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab9e9f8d33d8b4619cc101cedb2c2bfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbf8208683402ff70e7d8c115a7b440b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e43e89071e466c4395aaa6b0ecf97826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edde94d810e9a68b82bd211947fd6bf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f980d443e70dfe3e5e0da3bf886a9532, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/feb00e303fb517599e24cb945584513b"

These host range mutants replicated efficiently in normally nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2), and to a lesser extent in human breast carcinoma (MCF7) cell lines. Little if any replication was noted in baby hamster kidney (BHK), green African monkey kidney (COS-7), feline kidney (CRFK), and swine testicular (ST) cell lines. By fluorescent antibody (FA) staining, persistent viruses V10B and V30B, isolated at days 38 and 119 days postinfection, also demonstrated very low levels of replication in human HepG2 cells. These data suggest that persistence may rapidly select for host range expansion of animal viruses. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antibody directed against human carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) or with some monoclonal antibodies (Col-1, Col-4, Col-12, and Col-14) that bind human CEA significantly inhibited V51B infection. Under identical conditions, little or no blockade was evident with other monoclonal antibodies (kat4c or Col-6) which also bind the human CEA glycoproteins. In addition, an antibody (EDDA) directed against irrelevant antigens did not block V51B replication. Pretreatment with the Col-4 and Col-14 antibodies did not block Sindbis virus replication in HepG2 cells or MHV infection in DBT cells, suggesting that one or more CEA glycoproteins likely functioned as receptors for V51B entry into human cell lines. To test this hypothesis, the human biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) and CEA genes were cloned and expressed in normally nonpermissive BHK cell lines by using noncytopathic Sindbis virus replicons (pSinRep19). By growth curves and FA staining, human CEA and to a much lesser extent human Bgp functioned as receptors for V51B entry. Furthermore, V51B replication was blocked with polyclonal antiserum directed against human CEA and Bgp. Under identical conditions, the parental MHV strain A59 failed to replicate in BHK cells expressing human Bgp or CEA. These data suggest that MHV persistence may promote virus cross-species transmissibility by selecting for virus variants that recognize phylogenetic homologues of the normal receptor.",""

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. Methods One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. Results Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality (ρ=.20 and .19, respectively, P<.05) and physical symptoms (ρ=.21 and .19, P<.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (ρ=.33, P<.001) and sick days (ρ=.21, P<.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator. Conclusions This study corroborates evidence that attachment insecurity is associated with sleep disturbance and extends this association to the occurrence of physical symptoms and time off work due to sickness among workers in a high-stress occupation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/036ca51603383559a27beef0d163e828, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/043708a5e361d481af9d4dcf1cc7b2d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a02a5b4d3205fb1d9f7f9c36fc7a028, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17c8a41b3467ff42b445df8b10e25392, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ac7b672185ed4818a5ca0784bd42048, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bbfb3dd844fbf245d7ea5cd9085cf3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71399c3ac5e99a0b0b0a5a05865b6d20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75625a1f1d82c90bd5914bc1a68c91ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/776b580a0b98f87dcd4918a4ecbae223, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c4941ee68e1e2913d7eea747d1c2452, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d380bc1e6f95c7913c5a38917752492, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80baaff55728071d197163a2042e88eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8508e27e28b3561f3cdf3e9037c9e88d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8544ea6fa322ec080ec17286803fb0e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bad4389cd3449395fdc4f7eedbcc989, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e624a150989b7246593a6700859416e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0122c3ce76d33551921c6a7bbfa494d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a417682e72602090c9fff66c4a42c738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c3a42a13490165359f549e08bad6e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0baf1563869f1028fcee29c7e15511a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b62204f1b1ae3877855cf81a215fe0d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9cc6a830486535d0abcea4b8cc8767f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba96cd226a67522f0d14caed486f9fc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0e60e0ab3417483443f64437a1a0730, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5c04014587ae64ea09e29b97d0e7416, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cab76077904bc554dcad38b309e15cc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1b5bc4251f930e1f606339cbce1b845, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d54a73fde9b067efe6ab516a845b6275, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db25f75d11dce9a332158b99aed7ee34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed55b98ba5a22009b32edd91f1a2cbfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f365ed54ce43d3d377e43b8e407fc4b7"

However, the adverse event (AE) profiles of oral glucocorticoids, which result largely from the systemic absorption of those agents, have engendered concerns about the safety of INSs. These concerns persist for INSs despite significant or marked clinical differences between them and systemic corticosteroids in systemic absorption and among the INSs in bioavailability, mechanism of action, and lipophilicity, which may contribute to differences in AEs. For example, the systemic bioavailability of the INSs as a percentage of the administered drug is less than 0.1% for mometasone furoate, less than 1% for fluticasone propionate, 46% for triamcinolone acetonide, and 44% for beclomethasone dipropionate. A review of the safety profiles of INSs, as reported in clinical trials in acute and chronic RS and allergic rhinitis, shows primarily local AEs (eg, epistaxis and headache) that are generally classified as mild to moderate, with occurrence rates that are similar to those with placebo. Studies of the safety of mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide did not identify any evidence of systemic AEs, such as growth retardation in children due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone mineral density loss, or cataracts, which suggests that INSs can be safely administered in patients with acute RS without concern for systemic AEs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23575b6a0cb4525530fef3929d2e64da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/257e3e7a0f7554b1ac632120fb0f0a3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c83e8c4ddd7e5b5136ee057d4a919e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35aab5829dcba474a38abe3a578af364, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ff566b764be6381a4e0ed66a72a1246, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/425200850d633076c0a011141f8cc2a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46f5f5835bed8327daa93888caf6ef91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b60928477ac1d36f06c94698adcf9d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/617ff71a015538b8654bfaf6003ad892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/622a3ff40cdf2e0a8bb1cbe1c4984c85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c9b97949afbf0cc9c711f3d112a39a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cdbbb2defca3e12346f92811805712f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/878d47dbbace808e69270b2e50d9a8d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a32b9a9e00f78fdcc87219121fb9bcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f024de02ed3b9344031d72438867cad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98826369d16b269b124f07474b4faa62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c8e5a5941de71c05389b76d810873d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d664a86ab3544e13193cfce88e24da9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/affdb441e6ec18617e36e1ae959d0df6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1e625a513c87be64dcda248d8ed12d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6eb3edd110698a5f80d957ad10ae2e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/babc23185cabfd4feec28ebf04079d8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcbe3af01d8f4725a89e6ad698bdbf0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3c23a422ccf2f722b05dfdd2b83c93d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3e93e3c5484e5d3752a6a22507e3012, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6e2553ec483af146ed4f03663d0ae15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c78df3663916e912c95c3ea109dbeca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8431df5b01b2a650bf795d9d77871fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7eb4f939ee28fa0bcb978c5f3932855, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9962b054b01f09a8b1e4844e9ba0b91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db65dbee3ac6dec005fffb84e99e8b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc9a9281af603c6a2a235713331a6f39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed60ea93690e95aeaf68c8714fae2542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edfc956c31de7cb337fcb853ccbd5c53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f01c3b6ed08d499522cdce8f62bf4438, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4e591e93b36fda441b492fdf9df8310"

The two catalytic domains of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a type I integral membrane protein, catalyze the sequential reactions that convert peptidyl-Gly substrates into amidated products. We explored the hypothesis that a conserved His-rich cluster (His-Gly-His-His) in the linker region connecting its two catalytic domains senses pH and affects PAM trafficking by mutating these His residues to Ala (Ala-Gly-Ala-Ala; H3A). Purified recombinant wild-type and H3A linker peptides were examined using circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence; mutation of the His cluster largely eliminated its pH sensitivity. An enzymatically active PAM protein with the same mutations (PAM-1/H3A) was expressed in HEK293 cells and AtT-20 corticotrope tumor cells. Metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation revealed more rapid loss of newly synthesized PAM-1/H3A than PAM-1; although release of newly synthesized monofunctional PHM/H3A was increased, release of soluble bifunctional PAM/H3A, a product of the endocytic pathway, was decreased. Surface biotinylation revealed rapid loss of PAM-1/H3A, with no detectable return of the mutant protein to secretory granules. Consistent with its altered endocytic trafficking, little PAM-1/H3A was subjected to regulated intramembrane proteolysis followed by release of a small nuclear-targeted cytosolic fragment. AtT-20 cells expressing PAM-1/H3A adopted the morphology of wild-type AtT-20 cells; secretory products no longer accumulated in the trans-Golgi network and secretory granule exocytosis was more responsive to secretagogue.",""

SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus), a novel coronavirus that has been etiologically associated with SARS cases, is homologous with MHV (murine hepatitis coronavirus), and MHV small envelope E protein is capable of inducing apoptosis. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV encodes a small envelope E protein that is homologous with MHV E protein, thus inducing T-cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, a cDNA encoding SARS-CoV E protein was created using whole gene synthesis. Our results showed that SARS-CoV E protein induced apoptosis in the transfected Jurkat T-cells, which was amplified to higher apoptosis rates in the absence of growth factors. However, apoptosis was inhibited by overexpressed antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV E protein interacted with Bcl-xL in vitro and endogenous Bcl-xL in vivo and that Bcl-xL interaction with SARS-CoV E protein was mediated by BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domain 3) of Bcl-xL. Finally, we identified a novel BH3-like region located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of SARS-CoV E protein, which mediates its binding to Bcl-xL. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel molecular mechanism of T-cell apoptosis that contributes to the SARS-CoV-induced lymphopenia observed in most SARS patients.",""

L. infantum). A vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible L. chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the “LbSapSal” vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T(0)), during the post-vaccination protocol (T(3rd)) and after early (T(90)) and late (T(885)) times following L. chagasi-challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with “LbSapSal” is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-γ) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-β), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after “LbSapSal” immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the “LbSapSal” vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02101db8b5b8e5d716635fc644e3c0e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02b72e4303a584083aa569669a74742f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/057fa37766bbce04874bf922662a19cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13391a11e1bf0ef4dc7674a3eda4bfbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14b37ed77dbba89ac9f7a760a73d309e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a1bf0cfafa4266ebbe597d376343063, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f9daf0c4ca7a6392d1bb7b65e3b09a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20750b178c0871c2c08cadc76c989597, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24976ddc98f2b29327fd36b9cc795f7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41479163e6908bd0fe6133bc9b707e3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/488b5da74cf3ed9964bbad1feaf16161, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/579ae72136a49c02df1ad0627a399269, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e7a9de990f64435232e111a74e10c1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62fab123b4b6d07354a1ccccc1e6ba71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65c42de4a3910a0196ae0eac01d8672b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/691ef056e18e14a31f174f6d946674cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d387093123754040ba399c679ccb95f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77aa75e6cfc5835d81087cd7432a6bf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/808b2f96d44bef2348a6207793eb1b37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82b7039a6d52ccecc647d7a89577b3f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d7bad3ade70957c16ca5e66fad48838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e138282fe11758239619deca4090f80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ebf89f0c373d80abe818b6d8e3f329f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ef200b2082648b71e6090e484bb4305, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96a5a6a65dcc9b933eb38022afae77c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1129818ccd5fd6f17017bbe60168e4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a75ee1c042d185a504c8f8b7738bc4bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad6ca9f8de82d7d04173b88c6386bf56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7c15c94722bda3af5fa9cba0df3378d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf7f0ba6d1f11a3aed9186f62749b696, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3b6ad22b4954f5213301fa88c408348, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c52e55128bdeb9180f4ab5b321a3db52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7ded34c91d8fe30a3d3d97175618cd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbc0c70d4cdbeeb3f4ee5f6648e620cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1f37ac57d011c195d44824942b1d427, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7fd86f09971c72520cd35c6652e173f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecf95b9b9bdef073831dc039b2f425d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed72ab550c1d427a8bf85ac9cb84bae2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6cbda7adc0dd58c3202fec0a0d1c5e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f75cc7613162c47583d7d8cae476f4ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c0297e92ce4608817ffd910867f2f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbe92bb6c282ef675c6f462b190edbaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc692803af629db60a6fe8c158e4eddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd3908b2186c2c0c1b190ff469c7ef07"

Attention has been directed towards medicinal plants as these plants have been traditionally used for generations to treat symptoms of numerous diseases. It is established that plants harbour microorganisms, collectively known as endophytes. Exploring the as-yet untapped natural products from the endophytes increases the chances of finding novel compounds. The concept of natural products targeting microbial pathogens has been applied to isolate novel antimycobacterial compounds, and the rapid development of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis has significantly increased the need for new treatments against this pathogen. It remains important to continuously screen for novel compounds from natural sources, particularly from rarely encountered microorganisms, such as the endophytes. This review focuses on bioprospecting for polyketides and small peptides exhibiting antituberculosis activity, although current treatments against tuberculosis are described. It is established that natural products from these structure classes are often biosynthesised by microorganisms. Therefore it is hypothesised that some bioactive polyketides and peptides originally isolated from plants are in fact produced by their endophytes. This is of interest for further endophyte natural product investigations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98fd96aecd235aa5e78a44e683c43d96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd768cdac9a327c64687d085740cccd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5a9a1357aaa1b65e29d14a383caecb4"

In agreement with previous work, incubation of COV with valinomycin resulted in a perturbation of the absorbance spectrum of oxidized heme aa 3 in the Soret region (430 nm); gramicidin had no effect on the heme aa 3 absorbance spectrum. Different concentrations of the two ionophores were required for maximum respiratory control ratios in COV; 40- to 70-fold higher concentrations of valinomycin were required to completely uncouple electron transfer activity when compared to gramidicin. The proton translocating activity of COV incubated with each ionophore gave a similar apparent proton translocated to electron transferred stoichiometry ( H+ e− ratio) of 0.66 ± 0.10. However, COV treated with low concentrations of gramicidin (0.14 mg/g phospholipid) exhibited 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher rates of alkalinization of the extravesicular media after the initial proton translocation reaction than did COV treated with valinomycin, suggesting that gramicidin allows more rapid equilibration of protons across the phospholipid bilayer during the proton translocation assay. Moreover, at higher concentrations of gramicidin (1.4 mg/g phospholipid), the observed H+ e− ratio decreased to 0.280 ± 0.020, while the rate of alkalinization increased an additional 2-fold, suggesting that at higher concentrations, gramicidin acts as a proton ionophore. These results support the hypothesis that cytochrome c oxidase is a redox-linked proton pump that operates at similar efficiencies in the presence of either ionophore. Low concentrations of gramicidin dissipate the membrane potential in COV most likely by a channel mechanism that is different from the carrier mechanism of valinomycin, yet does not make the phospholipid bilayer freely permeable to protons.",""

We investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species. We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats. We analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework, and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny. We find evidence that sampling effort, IUCN status, and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats, and that these associations are independent of phylogeny. This study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species, and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26569ce5f9ce3bcea169198c36c81308, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27f2f00fb5180112443a1879839184c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dfb54ab7d58c74a6a88ae22e08cf7b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3117d308400b4556d6002364039474e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/376ddf33f73fd19de07c914bbc47029f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4083551fd118661af019e1bd51013075, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/424a0c690dc275ee2a43fec06e614cd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46bc81dae8cf744ca18a1ff784942bc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5034a5f00d716cd69deabdd6638fe0fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5715b28aa60c9ec4cce1a5731d3318f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62f1b4de7226ef6a1cd6f413c656b659, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66157d8e59dfa78236f88caa6b4b078f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66bd6c25a98210b07e2e8487dcaca3e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f176407f0717f981051a50944b589a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bb969d5a2a2ab1735b3716ed4aa6e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5a68a7b42bd68195fe57d3e02b3e670, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac982a75f0fa0e81eb080c37629849a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdbe5e5a4c4d5c369a564187a2d0e577, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6372e4a57eb905d366457b54fca7c5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e557a8572c6ba44d637972cd1634e90b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e56f9749ee0825483aa7e1c3d9655a0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e786ab05f3392a08b1070dd653b04b2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b6292f3b0a8991609434558fb91b17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f88534e8173e7ea3c6b2d2a350f289c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb90efc93009b4d425b9ec333ed4b481"

The active site region of SARS CoVMpro is divided into 8 subsites. Understanding the binding mode of SARS CoVMpro with a specific substrate is useful and contributes to structural-based drug design. The purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the SARS CoVMpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the S3 subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. RESULTS: The one turn α-helix chain (residues 47–54) of the SARS CoVMpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S3 subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of Glu47. During MD simulations, Glu47 of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the P3Lys of the octapeptide. CONCLUSION: MD simulations were carried out on the SARS CoVMpro-octapeptide complex. The hypothesis proposed that Glu47 of SARS CoVMpro is an important residue in the S3 subsite and is involved in binding with P3Lys of the octapeptide.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/132b08ceea7401de1e91d8eed402e225, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/254148f0b6022f53b6cfe5a1f8f2e863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a4f365beb26bf8616318d3b1efd3f31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d1b0b73d45a1a95a03f7ba300a56063, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/544b27ebbbfce43c72d20da9b5fd6945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6391da71cfa12ff79df73643e88e1991, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/659a57b50a1d39ff8d916bd83441b058, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dfd71fcc5b038868151597202dc4ec2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e78ff0d59be1586ef7c956672748b17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f9e26b83ebf4fc27cf277bc5446568a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c57d6d70e1364ef9b4dd6c917e102cde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccb344b72a3c6f2eccab70887831a4e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d87402d62a83d670eddd7372872a7563"

TRALI is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and specific therapies are unavailable. Neutrophils are recognized as the major pathogenic cells, whereas T regulatory cells and dendritic cells appear to be important for protection against TRALI. The pathogenesis, however, is complex and incompletely understood. It is frequently postulated that the complement system plays an important role in the TRALI pathogenesis. In this article, we assess the evidence regarding the involvement of complement in TRALI from both human and animal studies. We hypothesize about the potential connection between the complement system and neutrophils in TRALI. Additionally, we draw parallels between TRALI and other acute pulmonary disorders of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome regarding the involvement of complement. We conclude that, even though a role for complement in the TRALI pathogenesis seems plausible, studies investigating the role of complement in TRALI are remarkably limited in number and also present conflicting findings. Different types of TRALI animal models, diverse experimental conditions, and the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota may perhaps all be factors which contribute to these discrepancies. More systematic studies are warranted to shed light on the contribution of the complement cascade in TRALI. The underlying clinical condition of the patient, which influences the susceptibility to TRALI, as well as the transfusion factor (antibody-mediated vs non–antibody-mediated), will be important to take into consideration when researching the contribution of complement. This should significantly increase our understanding of the role of complement in TRALI and may potentially result in promising new treatment strategies.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2866730ecd75f20277ee2c25b87ea846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a25ee36de9f02157322e8d005a66534, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58343449910f4355f00a1d589b11349b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60e57b06279189bf5a27613fd4dd4768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61f811a374ed7ff4bda5182ac146ddec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/667cc38421e77e059cb0280f881b8342, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68439a10c36d02e5bb1c2f8cfc69fd9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d9d0bfd1164003a6d7219ffd986e1b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75826e0e7d0d4a5b8bb8393e7a3bf4bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c740d72e5e1231f93b6f2d532ba6e57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/818df9201185ad0e4a0c99d7602e83ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8da136b6162ab7e7b85867a24c9adb74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f4ca755faa2b073cc8037db43aa4b4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91074193530729df7f80bb99550908e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92861929398f032f2c28c8a74704af1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/989942be95b7ece822f94d066ac14912, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a67c7783fcdb75fbdc48e5d28316beff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa85ffead46be4285165e493590fbeeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab535e7902297fa7fed761037efd3742, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b54838b27dfddd53750d3329fd70313a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd3aa2d2150d34f487f4809ba230148b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd538e5424dcc2a8afdc0d021588c9a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bed38aa3a451c095e2258306044b3261, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c50a608dd77f5d1a9ad624990f7ae53b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cefc8369bc78bc5cb64ab2553dee9d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf9787be52634dcc5f9c8ec360e049fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0371dc6d502cbe524c04ec2894d6f42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d18af6a9a63a77436075527edb8ec0e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d346f5118ae2a80b4b4a7681c5194ee1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4b325d81adbdd1604a6f45f5fb7efe0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7de9ebd5df7cdb5e439275f0f42b751, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db7413d2080ebcc8bf6c7c6730fefa74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc79da7f01fa4bf4d229dae08390d011, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e249e347d41417f422352e6cf15d9eb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e34941811f37a0f192d26a4f7ddc3ed9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e61c0b6b50361417c4acf048a804affa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7657aa5c11a1b9eee82133ab3efd18f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9946aba38fad02435979071d501e0b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebeea07064a0756581d4dfd49e0d5dab"

Varicella is a primary infection that spreads rapidly in epidemics while zoster is a secondary infection that occurs sporadically as a result of the reactivation of previously acquired VZV. Reactivation is made possible by the establishment of latency during the initial episode of varicella. The signature lesions of both varicella and zoster are cutaneous vesicles, which are filled with a clear fluid that is rich in infectious viral particles. It has been postulated that the skin is the critical organ in which both host-to-host transmission of VZV and the infection of neurons to establish latency occur. This hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR(ci)) interacts with VZV in virtually all infected cells, except those of the suprabasal epidermis, in a way that prevents the release of infectious viral particles. Specifically, the virus is diverted in an MPR(ci)-dependent manner from the secretory pathway to late endosomes where VZV is degraded. Because nonepidermal cells are thus prevented from releasing infectious VZV, a slow process, possibly involving fusion of infected cells with their neighbors, becomes the means by which VZV is disseminated. In the epidermis, however, the maturation of keratinocytes to give rise to corneocytes in the suprabasal epidermis is associated uniquely with a downregulation of the MPR(ci). As a result, the diversion of VZV to late endosomes does not occur in the suprabasal epidermis where vesicular lesions occur. The formation of the waterproof, chemically resistant barrier of the epidermis, however, requires that constitutive secretion outlast the downregulation of the endosomal pathway. Infectious VZV is therefore secreted by default, accounting for the presence of infectious virions in vesicular fluid. Sloughing of corneocytes, aided by scratching, then aerosolizes the virus, which can float with dust to be inhaled by susceptible hosts. Infectious virions also bathe the terminals of those sensory neurons that innervate the epidermis. These terminals become infected with VZV and provide a route, retrograde transport, which can conduct VZV to cranial nerve (CNG), dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and enteric ganglia (EG) to establish latency. Reactivation returns VZV to the skin, now via anterograde transport in axons, to cause the lesions of zoster. Evidence in support of these hypotheses includes observations of the VZV-infected human epidermis and studies of guinea pig neurons in an in vitro model system.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0625cb83aeefbd540d73ba0809fcef5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ab0018b2c124d323e7e7728d32f859f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fc2f85d9d0a31247776330ab67d87a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11b319763e97406b2b1bf2ea12c8713c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11d67d55162e3ea9842fd3e9910402d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1db302d4fbd74c274525e20a84d32c71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c61010958e895e8666bb8fa7f6581af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c797cad7e18d9277e0205587fc219c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f62eb162374f28d41e4dcaae28f2227, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31c7036f60df05dde04592a326384eb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33cfd9c02660dcc6225e03aca29d5098, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/362addbe82fe44e5c6cb3324aaa2f654, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/387755a054738db96fa4c9c72e3c192e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fb5486eb5ae99c59bbc5523ac69a10f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44bb80984acacb85dc9a055a094a1d81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44e0c75bee59c86755681fc24ab0ece1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47211874d1676936b5db42ce1c610d3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47cb231371af8add2db9f1f65e270106, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/486b5402810d2d7d0d41cbdc279d15d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ef8e47426b1dfee2a2dc73a456ef389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fed1cda73d9f67b5cfec2fdcc9b1e42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/523ea8d4b466b4cb739df014adcc9884, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/586ea734ead6643d0f55a2ccff954ecc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/627c4bd2a950f7b1db9c834f030692a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/629a643a377332423977e23e0952d278, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64af6c90a843d94897d220c9f7b6d9da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67cefe97de23e3e7ba822297c15cbc90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688e0bcc9a48ff29e423b8ff11767570, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d168948ae149e5b231f826da9ccea7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c4d6f3a148d1dcd748f6aaebdb00edf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dcc79868c67be8cdf8746c0dd97b9a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fbe128b1cfff96996d715b5dac01a64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80fa8cb844aeb43a7c1f6a18a1cc4f22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83464a0def2689d6efb3c7abeb067b54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83c61341a19cec20d65839dab70ceda8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a0fefaf443d12d23089c0d22262de36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f1f81e287301a2bf5e8334ce4abd88a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ff9fff96c2bc7b8c7732e751ed0b817, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0b3e4388d81de8f55539f4d64caf7e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0e3f3190496d5929314a7aecf90cad3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4535a5406b8f3564fc2888043c427c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa0f632fa0edb649b9485158d17e9c85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af52fe1a9a475fb9098a70c104ff5e73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0f119643046b49af4ee93e7a993b456, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3c3272b19735e0530273adaf0f1f6aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6a7b8093d26358363068c160794d902, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b970c5dcd6c73ccdc61287d61b48c38e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd699c59145ddf5ddb102052d54bb68d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd7f714e59bef5fc7707440863c1f64a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf611ed1a5159deddf733272a2d00d93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0a2630fd73dec0cd0f7ccfc59c7eaf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c31fd7ae0f3c4eeeb896cdfd6c8c8568, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c53085b8118be3c59b30724e940aea44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbf447105ab4ba9f8dea10c1d63a04be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e143057f06c788465b9e77fa9e8b2f2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1f14ad23aa63f50cfd637e50b03c7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e20d7c72598f638a48a11a327296280a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2f8c698570f522b3aa2e9c18fc897d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e309168b256823a26df1beb1ed0a0d03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e55e7434b0576251b83d77decfd4dda4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f592cb5e1ed4020e086c4ae8f23c4c5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f66f092a5ab0994df1305ab5838c8183, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe6b4e8b4301d5ee031feae768ca6709"

The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, long-incubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN. Studies conducted over the past decade have provided particularly strong arguments that BEN and UUC are caused by chronic poisoning with aristolochic acids (AAs). In light of these later studies, one can raise the question whether AAs could be responsible for previously and currently widespread unrecognized global renal disease and UUC.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04cca43b0c1158d6d3c63f5afdf60d35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15d77f0f9cc416526445956f803ab82c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a36ed96f679b54c4d12008d618793ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aa8d19f9101f830ff673e43ea4e38ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e1b234af57598ea86cbfcd627b19161, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ffd3f2e72e711c9dd389f28791308b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/288782ace88b8cce0c2ea2bcffc922b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/376cf8887d1ef87f5d5eaa22c31f38e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4684fe144ffc23eedaddcabf74a532f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47b6774d3598c441dd25509bf4c9dcfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/484dfbe47922a1dfe91e5d202e053c67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48dc666f8f1a609860e4de68bb2775f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49f652f0e316a003e3f6a84d6a6f423f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/553ad227baced68bf66d5e0da98a2036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6932e0a848c083338e5e78c850c72cfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dfd42cb006554a1300b374b15774943, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d6054c6376c42c7d219bd7ac9a6da15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eead6999dede446b8f2133f558f986c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fcf8cc05685e2d63305b205275f3ba6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a06267d599d11605a6b359d4420b025a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5330f15841467a8faf3ae09ea5c00b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa249ecbd84dcd6af19895806771aa5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aefdbd41aa6b0d3e8f05d349e860ed39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b85a6618dd6cdd3db3cbea080a592f0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c021d314bf7a599cdadcd9463f9597cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c13e12dfad2f5d0b5c7ab0fcf1aece4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c47ec160975badc32b64bf27733506f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0e5b6bb68e2e430a79e75cf3fd3de25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e117d8c516516603343fdff1b48856ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9bd3b32dcc3b6262bc1f04c19d1dc13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a6634a76793e41c2369553e67fef21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4dbc7adfbc95d45136dbbd84eaaf472, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbc36aff43d5a0c3a6960b86ab2b1203"

Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells. Furthermore simulation of this mechanism in vitro might provide an interesting new therapeutic approach against microorganisms.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00e6c335ed5ef586537039f988f21ba0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/046cb6c88d24b857d582a679d4ed574b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05fddd8432e383ca772d8a5af551fed1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20eb68daa704122cd8bcdf721a61f0c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20ef5b7ae2a636d96319f8286e035aef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2630e969d4e65ba259ddee1d7df4e18e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/371e9882a554a66d3eaf1a7ce5e35841, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ab8fbb44e32afb0f08c36ac09f62bb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/447c0cd7dc7ad4ce68ed6f67e067cd7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ac2c4427486804883fe8d8bd7205a97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4deb6d31bd374475e5febbbce14c129b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/556f57afa05afb51635b931809b66cf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55725ef835006b381b8c3b4a0f4ac35d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58024aee6acac9a6c24a2d0d47d55779, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61e9e8451a63e255dd8fc9910f1b5fae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c98cb0dc3e16f292776fc7e2493377c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d4470c8ac9e4c1ddc56412280cddb09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85861298eab572178edd38ed64729b33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85c057ef4db78580378a2980a440f771, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8773d17d73bef9a8d95d5954d61d6310, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/880bbcec7e23873397a6f5a1befbecc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/896ac1fdce91b0d449d96bfa7eea1602, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd90d020094e37e16a93653e36cb823, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d1283f8d3cd5c23922cb727e51f305e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90d79d4a0015b80050347e429339b344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9429a7514bc8e8ee540274214c7493a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95b0efbf81324dfbe6c0e56bcf1dd3c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9701af55b1688d2e696557bd0bb548da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9755a6e76116d35f7aafc90de1f1e655, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/994ab12d0a83ab4cfbde83facba4953f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b15969a607eb5aca3145d7d194b071d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4a44387f9bcce72f756ef82dd586900, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6705254f13456c29d160b440e991a3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aad86d13d0b64910535c0b8f689b41a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad7bf5e50139c0f67c1ff5153265a1be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b561d060dc9e3458a7e0ce9c8bd3cba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c080c765032ed194490227613c8fce0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c09d14ed48f81380d20986be9cb62e20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d6227205899ecb20d5baba20a87858, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cde92013cbd40f74c2852c13974422a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce8e0630f5c8211cb5ec9651577ab7ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcabab47237db3841594e05e8868b0a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df0bb904d9d5b5da163bd510ee11a692, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e78a8d14faa16316048382947615f34a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb394769d6ea25123c7f40cace80afb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f159716819d84e17599131841237d30a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f30c2665831902b3c3326fe4ab82bc19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f885d82deaa7dc2fd047f2b74f1153b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9437fa21c3ada08111362e3cc99e3fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf275d8b92c942fb0dc8ae81a5de5bb"

Another study2 included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23·7%), diabetes mellitus (16·2%), coronary heart diseases (5·8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2·3%). In a third study,3 of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these three studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study. Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels.4 The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs).4 Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2.5 ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19. • View related content for this article If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism. We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on Feb 28, 2020, we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.",""

Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg “window stage”, active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. METHODS: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used. The “sandwich” therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated. FINDINGS: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally. When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered. A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these “sandwich”-treated mice. Efficient intrahepatic anti-HBV immune responses were also observed in these mice, including the formation of aggregates of myeloid cells with CD8(+)T cells and increased TNF-α, granzyme B production. INTERPRETATION: The “sandwich” combination therapy not only efficiently decreased HBsAg and HBV DNA levels but also induced effective cellular and humoral immunity, which may result in functional cure of CHB.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0324c9d15a02f781865ed70e43a1b999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0acdb236d66496e507927c9588ef6546, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b57346ec18e50370a202e41fa5cdc00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/133491cf26d8eb69893ba6757ded6d44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/171255cf1eeacdcc9ffabd768076d686, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a048031b512934f56ce393717cc4e92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a3f7903393cb0474dd68959a03a2931, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c5df6b4cf3be0240b4ce335cb4c4ed5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fd8c5e0847afeedefd7a18eb7ed28fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/200825305a07204ce2bd9928ad28ac2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/288c17f8f856fe997f13760dac4c4290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b3a023f473ac535c6c48acb326aa404, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b5853530c319b56fbafef0e09f169c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b5e66ba5a63e0a27d53dd5315b7cfa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fc851f6029e5a8f2c83576d6a902f63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34fe8c10cb356e7d88444ffbc3493ea9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/364a0f6bd14b9be35306ccb91e38e04e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ee9801f630efba7d7b71888ab8cd8ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4212f2a6d6f081c641d885c6e7bf4a70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4906ba419195ad69689b78079c4a4648, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ec7cd3eef48ffd6545f467777ca9fc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fd4f92f58d48190c5e850292648b9fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cb2ddf0f3c2972c0e387a9fcf8aaa0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ce9e8c587738c39a0c596afa88f6adb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b3e92551fbb4eef961b7f580797e36d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86268553aacae59b1a593ffe1da48565, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8844dd178782e717d234350158f7716f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96e560bf67379fd5e06162695d3fcb79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ac69236375990d6387d80ebb3234e92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a32bd9e51ad8678c817757cee1062552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab775ff731e930748559e7310bc4dc90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af16213fec4ceecf4cb134c26312de69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afab1b3b220eab70967d669db72972bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b117ed41905d001226e7db205af570a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b63fbbf8d8681e01d7af6e1d81d9fefb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b66c0967d9bc79ea7d6f3a935f7d7443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6ddd9fa9069aa16398831c39d593762, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcc696a0f2699e613ca7cf23911a0d89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd8fee51ee452feb39e887eb64441c14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6b9ce16ed04b5a1a560e0a05adf3b2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfd5414cccaa85d5c45c7320d6dd0686, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d08307af66f420b1f15b8648f3f471f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8161cc9cc79705e0f9e415d4b01e52e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddc6e8821319b337adbceb40db2bcc05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e74aaf87a82840065c4c31f5696052a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b31ed3af870d9cdfdb82aa48e7964a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f35e412b74e064192f26946d49d89d36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7823505daf150d2e7cf59c1521eaf84"

In the case of the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of SARS-CoV infection in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease. To elucidate the biogeographic origin of SARS-CoV and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence, we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout Thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences. To this end, RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae was targeted by RT-PCR in non-invasive samples from bats collected in Thailand. Two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species: one Betacoronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus and one Alphacoronavirus in Hipposideros armiger. Interestingly, these viruses from South-East Asia are related to those previously detected in Africa (Betacoronavirus-b) or in Europe (Alphacoronavirus & Betacoronavirus-b). These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human. All reported Betacoronaviruses-b (SARS-CoV group) of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts, which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of Betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families. Moreover, despite its probable pathogenicity, we found that a Betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony. These findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence. The host’s phylogeny, biogeography and behaviour, combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence. Elucidating the common ancestor of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of SARS-CoV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/006ed6ff43240cd8f1d064d6cd57f330, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/008fc42c1007763fd72650758be97d17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0611079f9e06a97bc6276e2fec27be19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/064409dc69a38205d476e1110161d11a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06927e46d91aae925e76665e4ba84584, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0715c54bfbd0cadf5a5adece6852ef6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/077be536370e41494d01c7f31d2a6cc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0885758c512597c75aa417b5640b8d24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08e2d27e2795af22aa3715c7da381b00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c9f68c2e9641a17258cdd22d669c75d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ea5b044bcdc21b05160005c222483ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f30f7c95d7af96ce103cfa261b0288b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10baa057dfe9c6d113f1321af4de38f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18c1940f52fe922f7704f4e3b03ffeb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a5b58d104c5579a8c2ee00e5b87dc98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1be7c112156cb68a397d194b30a2f527, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/220add0a4a46b36800640ca45721e2ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27a578f767d59c2fb1931360e7874c66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d37b94dbfa4fc43cf6b9aca9909a219, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f8bea414d0f4beb37617cd8db8c4c65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41dcdc0f294bd6684fdb16fdc745ac21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42cb9b959e24e37f75c4290ee5d0779f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44a68f371ee41cca0297a468b70e4066, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49ae01d1afd2135e3d5292b910b1f72d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54cef33a54ae8cd2a96d94030fdc0c92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59e3589ff7b90d006cd6f0cff7d43bff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c662309619fc0a195c21e6b104eba62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ed64c705ac70c9f0ed2877be4036ca7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fac9d56b3bdd9a098abc087d12f51b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74e192790f09cf0c0a7925d99c67c509, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f11c39b77c6d817fed3a22a30837385, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/822e6beaba7e3cd42e31768c2422c87e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85899ac9ece9ace476add3bf64b37e8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89953b6828f249319cb91ed09c67c4dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e1a904d6ae689550d2c0d8fd8699613, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94933e5d9a2e9bf13035a77718b9edcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b881f18ce0ad6567b2abbc552dd4951, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6203ed92d9220cb74b1fad0181004cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7925ae2eb40ea8c76f705904c94b589, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6fddd602b1dc9eec746a202945dcc8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7af3f4d19114c8f688c40e8afbd546e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c00970e5e5b97081b0600fa9e4954a3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2728aced7f82b7fb03fa063b9f5a934, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c30f149c1519b55dbb83d965c560fef0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4545a2d40652ae713b172f0023e7f9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c74de216f5b3e9ae3dda346d5df7281a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cab8033308c7e290fcb46cf423ee6ade, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b6706c76ba4b2daa455265916beaf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d40a2ae222d338b66000d1f44dd33226, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7e8aace241163b57d2c2cc5291726ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da9c2cff5d389f7e533b2e74cc3f4d8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbb61e8fe0dd35e95a2a68a1b028647a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd1dbe988affc9d07c96d7ca44572283, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfe9aa553a159880128bf8789e7e0f02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e107fa34dac2738ce5d4c0028363046d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21e9b93d71baec03b91a6c4f9a7e7a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e38e02c2f3c92f0cee8b983d0e4ab5ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e549d90029fac6b83689a83b92dea334, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0bc2c42b188a954ca59af5f48c0b102, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3af2846fd55610869491892530e9db0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f791d9aec54046c165a0153b5a0e043a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa80df28180e5913b15527390ede60a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff5922267f1680d9e146d093bdfa9510"

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence on the viral messenger RNA and is stimulated by a specific structure, downstream of the shift site. While in group M, the most abundant HIV-1 group, the frameshift stimulatory signal is an extended bulged stem-loop, we show here, using a combination of mutagenesis and probing studies, that it is a pseudoknot in group O. The mutagenesis and probing studies coupled to an in silico analysis show that group O pseudoknot is a hairpin-type pseudoknot with two coaxially stacked stems of eight base-pairs (stem 1 and stem 2), connected by single-stranded loops of 2nt (loop 1) and 20nt (loop 2). Mutations impairing formation of stem 1 or stem 2 of the pseudoknot reduce frameshift efficiency, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of these stems restore the frameshift efficiency to near wild-type level. The difference between the frameshift stimulatory signal of group O and group M supports the hypothesis that these groups originate from a different monkey to human transmission.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1435aed718c06bb9a41df530dd924b0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/189ea27e4b7fffa39619d2d5437b962c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e4e0eb915b3639bd84bd797e94e6e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24fb62530b02234ee9d02ebfffc7dc02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/252868530d400e522ab0964f5d21fe80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25993f2cafb1f20332d0528bf6006df0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28bbcf230f8b2a9ae2cf8e5b107d311d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2da84d37ad4e4436dd4886136eddc8e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d1bb0f0f9b429c5d73018ad8487754f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b60728eeba8218424d8563a2eaded94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c397e2c21cb48724224d6c79fbe675b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66f4d4abd0941e097b781f63f9a84d96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cc52858813f5aeedfa164c8ae899053, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/704974491168608d44226d0590fe25be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/741c78b29fb7f6f0ad2c10d3e88a4321, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/819c2555a74de8bd940b3b593373404a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96e568b5255cb83f5d7dd784540641f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d23505185a6596fe9f157fc0c3c4416b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee9315039587bcd1630dfdc42c680457, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0964015f674486c556d0c66a859f97a"

In addition, the mechanisms causing these perturbations have not been fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to assess acid–base changes in puppies suffering from CPV enteritis, using a modified strong ion model (SIM). The hypothesis of the study was that severe acid–base disturbances would be present and that the SIM would provide insights into pathological mechanisms, which have not been fully appreciated by the Henderson–Hasselbalch model. The study analysed retrospective data, obtained from 42 puppies with confirmed CPV enteritis and 10 healthy control dogs. The CPV-enteritis group had been allocated a clinical score, to allow classification of the data according to clinical severity. The effects of changes in free water, chloride, l-lactate, albumin and phosphate were calculated, using a modification of the base excess algorithm. When the data were summated for each patient, and correlated to each individual component, the most important contributor to the metabolic acid–base changes, according to the SIM, was chloride (P <0.001). Severely-affected animals tended to demonstrate hypochloraemic alkalosis, whereas mildly-affected puppies had a hyperchloraemic acidosis (P =0.007). In conclusion, the acid–base disturbances in CPV enteritis are multifactorial and complex, with the SIM providing information in terms of the origin of these changes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/577985daba5de4b0ce2f327f4659cd1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7264698c1bbfe0b068b8035361239cfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8516a882674a44dd1908717676e082ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e74ee1f068d20a2e2d18a0f853d2926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8c58469991bb6e918254f61eef61b0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd1ad687d605362261143ebb64901df7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9368ece17425c5d2e16db3663918e46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa4d9a7d7889281ff79af489a9603340"

Based on experimental infections with the North American and S large-DEL types, we also hypothesized that PEDV virulence may be linked to the S1 subunit of the S protein. To test this hypothesis, we have now assayed in gnotobiotic piglets various recombinant PEDVs generated by reverse genetics. Piglets inoculated with CV777 maintained in National Institute of Animal Health, along with piglets infected with a recombinant form of the same virus, developed subclinical to mild diarrhea. In contrast, severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, astasia, and high mortality were observed in piglets inoculated with recombinant strains in which the S gene was partially or fully replaced with corresponding sequences from the highly virulent Japanese PEDV isolate OKN-1/JPN/2013. Indeed, symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the OKN-1/JPN/2013, and were especially pronounced in younger piglets. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the S1 subunit of the S protein is an important determinant of PEDV virulence, and advance development of new vaccine candidate.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02dccc2a5b2e84ee27559747e779c198, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06236d416d36cf0709bd71b2babdf6d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a32d0ba2a714c0a7dbcfe88bcfdddff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24e1d60e056bd4858ae0c1c626c89f2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28b3abc8bb8b1eb806ba730298c984df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28f54eafbac6d5623783f682a1518e12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/309cafdd8a3e5198b4a193eac2d4d6ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/440bd5058f98c69cbe7c29d1c15baf42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c10eb6224c2c4f0279b81559ba2f0cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d210b14eaf8fee90651dc592550b336, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59e2962dde765d6333a9815855dba159, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a518ddae9a07da1eac6e7abc6ee0e16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d7b1fad28a0dcd40b057544329d935, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82fdca3eedc10544c892d48175e11eb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83743c1b667ea7ade0ddf2123e3ad043, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ed3a2cb81b80e21b6e02c3466b9222d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/917dc27ecb30b90bb3a9ce9c17328d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/987476b92c563629a0d0868e9d50e65e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9be83c6de213fdedd564c7647a139478, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8feaeb40979ddfffe95d2f02f4989ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a979b37f55852d0d28f2b2c4b92b8935, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b192dd47704abdf2704331ad05f80a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b70083f6c1787f1ee17a853617344eaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29b9cdbf0953ea7baf84eaa9c32a428, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca4da30bfebac8c7b7985c3090bf43a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5d07ffea298d92d1b69836b84e068cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfaac32cdf735550160dfb5bca417410, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e081fa5c100db59ec596f314ab357341, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f185b5c7e01a6af70d60c85674fee02c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6cc504317136084f51505d8cb8782d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8a5455ac3e8b4c41f5140e64f24bd3c"

Some of the H5N1 and H9N2 virus subtypes induce markedly elevated cytokine levels when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. We previously showed that H5N1/97 hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the detailed mechanisms of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha hyperinduction following influenza virus infections are not known. Negative feedback regulations of cytokine expression play important roles in avoiding overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection. We investigated the roles of protein phosphatases including MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) in modulating p38MAPK activation and downstream TNF-alpha expressions in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac) infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 influenza virus. We demonstrate that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced TNF-alpha production in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. H9N2/G1 induced PP2A activity in PBMac and, with the treatment of a PP2A inhibitor, p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha production were further increased in the virus-infected macrophages. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce the expression of PP2A indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK in virus-infected PBMac. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages. Our results may provide new insights into the control of cytokine dysregulation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14c85eb0c8aee7b57cd908689d4f2a09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18b3901cdcec44c47c5f52ba6f21d5a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bc8bc69d30fb1a6246bc92a623da996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26a449c80c337e7d8b201d5523fd9c77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27863aa7377af66689427e8dc14f990b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d5970bc7cee83ff4018e7db8958dc34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/300aa5fafb71f0b0b82f25977bb36aaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39e5b5b7649788d7f55e872fb6fb10f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3aa26b13213885a2ee88a56972130228, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b6f23221dc214d031518a6df7621a6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c0a0f5718faedf348a6a27c7e32809d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cc47cab14565c5f25524fed8101b05c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/439b046f8d721d945d16fb2a926f6b1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b41f5835f6704156fe9a0a249023faf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50c1ac6a122633ce6d0d9ddb4b8aafaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5980efa9db0c70284f22227f765d8d11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e392793b3dc6278227785b379c58637, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/643c7a56b6e0039151033936a371b8b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/701b33fd3a8fcf02610160d8e33eb615, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/775b9ea62b6a106cf4e442b452c50389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b7052f4938db8d775a906586e6043ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/808068acaa87d0c92dcd8bf7691b81be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d28ec6ef54f52f72458988f3853caa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88f3d587157c2e480a8aa1152f0d5eb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8aeff3231eed867ddc49cd4fc7755496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c78e2c282b7fd71511856d8b2e0cb05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92ca753826892036022fd958d3aa2417, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93bd20c5b6dc0ce656e458eaa2c9c5a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c656cb31b7aa73b72d96c092d1618ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ca0f554dcb54c93a2a5a745007e2a47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ce7917f976be61dde9e70228e05807d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a17b81b4fc957056301069de53ec3217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a60f43ee25bdba00fe50a168a65133c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adb82bf52e6b7e64e452f3162f4163a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1ffcab3c88c940be71c3e598c43b981, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b22528632e42e3f7280fb161112ad835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8a4dc0b926bdca81887891d9c4992d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baed5d4b233cd7398b2ae531286b4a03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb189187c4db02df4a72013a38e42261, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c47f5b46b39671c78f83b2897111694c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c774e4aace2a690f1417e53552972dc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb084d05d7bcd91076fe88d2e1ae451c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc5b957dd5086e050a5174a306fd63a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d14baaf55d78210ea7d3fa7cc4519121, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9ec4b36d5b724a347e18bfdbcb6f3bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e168dc7bbe01574149c4728a7c81b0ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2b46f0874d1b5f1eebf609d7b8c8014, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7d7c58dddc35d3a76111e94ac663b52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eeb8d7fcee3294ee6cab99b51181189a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3cc6e01d0b6c820b3ed5d42bc27280a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcce784e84a116d567c95320514c31d9"

ACE2 cleaves single-terminal residues from several bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II. However, few of its substrates in the respiratory tract have been identified, and the mechanism underlying the role of ACE2 in inflammatory lung disease has not been fully characterized. In an effort to identify biological targets of ACE2 in the lung, we tested its effects on des-Arg(9) bradykinin (DABK) in airway epithelial cells on the basis of the hypothesis that DABK is a biological substrate of ACE2 in the lung and ACE2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute lung inflammation partly through modulating DABK/bradykinin receptor B1 (BKB1R) axis signaling. We found that loss of ACE2 function in mouse lung in the setting of endotoxin inhalation led to activation of the DABK/BKB1R axis, release of proinflammatory chemokines such as C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2), C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (KC), and TNF-α from airway epithelia, increased neutrophil infiltration, and exaggerated lung inflammation and injury. These results indicate that a reduction in pulmonary ACE2 activity contributes to the pathogenesis of lung inflammation, in part because of an impaired ability to inhibit DABK/BKB1R axis-mediated signaling, resulting in more prompt onset of neutrophil infiltration and more severe inflammation in the lung. Our study identifies a biological substrate of ACE2 within the airways, as well as a potential new therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.",""

The methodology involved the use of an oscillating saw with variable saw blade frequencies and different saw blade contact loads on dry human femora. Released airborne particles were counted per diameter by a particle counter inside a closed and controlled environment. Results corroborated with the hypotheses: higher frequencies or lower contact loads resulted in higher numbers of aerosol particles produced.

The efficiency of these frameshift events determines the ratio of viral Gag to Gag-Pol proteins available for viral particle morphogenesis, and changes in ribosomal frameshift efficiencies can severely inhibit virus propagation. Since ribosomal frameshifting occurs during the elongation phase of protein translation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that agents that affect the different steps in this process may also have an impact on programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We examined the molecular mechanisms governing programmed ribosomal frameshifting by using two viruses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we present evidence that pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a single-chain ribosomal inhibitory protein that depurinates an adenine residue in the α-sarcin loop of 25S rRNA and inhibits translocation, specifically inhibits Ty1-directed +1 ribosomal frameshifting in intact yeast cells and in an in vitro assay system. Using an in vivo assay for Ty1 retrotransposition, we show that PAP specifically inhibits Ty1 retrotransposition, suggesting that Ty1 viral particle morphogenesis is inhibited in infected cells. PAP does not affect programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift efficiencies, nor does it have a noticeable impact on the ability of cells to maintain the M(1)-dependent killer virus phenotype, suggesting that −1 ribosomal frameshifting does not occur after the peptidyltransferase reaction. These results provide the first evidence that PAP has viral RNA-specific effects in vivo which may be responsible for the mechanism of its antiviral activity.",""

Computer analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristics of a class III membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence but containing three successive transmembrane α-helices in the N-terminal half, much the same as the coronavirus membrane (M) protein. The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum. The common features of the torovirus E and the coronavirus M protein support our hypothesis that an evolutionary relationship exists between these groups of intracellularly budding viruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/077001becdf596941bfe45dc703df8d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/078f6ad7a1ace427abfea7d2b6be3e63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11c4f54ebc45c75f4c406c0c544db4c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1487eb6eb7e7f2ba49e21f083b52d29a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15c7f5f30fa7f398b6b105b0809862b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/162e5725a5812bc2c5e10400000eddc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1afee8210be2bd5bf2bc017e4887a4f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a929937e3cd0b923d3e5d3bd01b1fd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30c374cf015e2b2da045ecaead2a48e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31fe946ff4e5e646d63ccd9af7349087, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/368bff91199380db8b11f406eda7cddc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a14435d5ada1fa1c1e61d1f099bead8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a716730287d825f849f2c6d1e3efddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45a18db3061f480804331a6d7da038f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b0e522a506f58149a4b8f91aaae5541, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e4c4ac0f3779bda43126fcc64727bcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/501527c5ce263d8540ccc0abaafeafff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/513a167fefed4acb3cee7d1b962d1d6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55a7f266d68e60db9c04c716a910337a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a4a71c33b2c215b40d848c6b93c12ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66447e7373ff1b7ae66198b49deb790d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67999678c1de81acadff037165a519a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67a99c4333cb9be79808e63079c647ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/687c4e008cf3f9d452e8471d870283f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b9fbc7910dbc653e19c61a0aa475f12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8637f61b2d0d445358532d7ff70f935d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f0894802dcb709d2ac849ed4855189f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b00131c28fb398454b7a98e4a4c9f96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e24a6eaa6f8b0b7e1299195cfa6eb95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8248563c017c83bbc30e8511ee345f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba766a4107b9537bdc2207d2dba85d7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b798e0d7ce3ab243848f30909ac5ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4aac32da0e48712893255c9c14a4768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5d26c789d38c53104236a3c3764f939, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e623622f513d8eb34688ce4c2295a462, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b4c8e313260d733aea4e618fcc96fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb35cb1037e163cc70d9a3c52ff493c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c1bd1e21ae1effabdc9f2ed2bb6900, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c5291a00c8838f06d235f2876d639a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcc8d79d0d981222108409b9d3120c25"

We have found a novel anti-inflammatory pathway that is initiated by the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), interacting with Fcγ receptor (FcγR) on monocytes. This pathway is protective in animal models of endotoxin shock. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the FcγR might contribute to monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma. METHODS: We conducted an observational study on a prospectively identified cohort of adult patients with convenience enrollment admitted after severe trauma. We enrolled 66 patients and collected blood samples at enrollment and again at 48 and 72 hrs. Patients were followed through their hospital stay and any septic events before 14 days were recorded. Cytokine and CRP levels were determined in the plasma from all three blood draws. Additionally, DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for the 131 H/R FcγRIIa polymorphism that strongly affects the binding of IgG and CRP to this receptor. RESULTS: Elevated levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 MCP-1 as well as CRP were associated with reduced time to post-traumatic sepsis in Cox regression analysis. Expression of monocyte HLA-DR below 45% on patient monocytes was also associated with sepsis (HR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.45-6.93). Genetic analysis found that individuals with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP poorly were also more likely to have decreased monocyte HLA-DR and post-traumatic sepsis. In vitro studies showed that CRP could attenuate monocyte deactivation in volunteers with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a common genetic variation in the FcγRIIa receptor may contribute to infectious susceptibility in trauma patients. In vitro experiments suggest that this association is related to the inability of CRP to bind to this FcγRIIa receptor variant.

Relevant theoretical frameworks remain nascent. PURPOSE: To model associations between trust in information, perceived hygiene effectiveness, knowledge about the causes of influenza, perceived susceptibility and worry, and personal hygiene practices (PHPs) associated with influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional household telephone surveys on avian influenza A/H5N1 (2006) and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) gathered comparable data on trust in formal and informal sources of influenza information, influenza-related knowledge, perceived hygiene effectiveness, worry, perceived susceptibility, and PHPs. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed domain content while confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the extracted factors. The hypothesized model, compiled from different theoretical frameworks, was optimized with structural equation modelling using the A/H5N1 data. The optimized model was then tested against the A/H1N1 dataset. RESULTS: The model was robust across datasets though corresponding path weights differed. Trust in formal information was positively associated with perceived hygiene effectiveness which was positively associated with PHPs in both datasets. Trust in formal information was positively associated with influenza worry in A/H5N1 data, and with knowledge of influenza cause in A/H1N1 data, both variables being positively associated with PHPs. Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry in both datasets. Independent of information trust, perceived influenza susceptibility associated with influenza worry. Worry associated with PHPs in A/H5N1 data only. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of influenza cause and perceived PHP effectiveness were associated with PHPs. Improving trust in formal information should increase PHPs. Worry was significantly associated with PHPs in A/H5N1.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/313707ca42faed8fd61dbd95cc8c758f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c2a541d61ab138c444eb3e54b74cc54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/650021f19af8da0bdc35d7ce58649c38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/675e770ea9fb13ffef4b7b116eb82213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c2e434c35fe23356654514c3f7705a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913ceded4b60425ae6b6d1f080eaeee3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b04dcef3b619b825e5aa7825383cba67"

COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify COVID-19 as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves high levels of classification accuracy and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5,000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.",""

Filovirus infection requires fusion of the host cell and virus membranes, a process that is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). GP contains two subunits, the surface subunit (GP1), which is responsible for cell attachment, and the transmembrane subunit (GP2), which catalyzes membrane fusion. The GP2 ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions, N-terminal and C-terminal (NHR and CHR, respectively) that adopt a six-helix bundle during the fusion process. The refolding of this six-helix bundle provides the thermodynamic driving force to overcome barriers associated with membrane fusion. Here we report the crystal structure of the MARV GP2 core domain in its post-fusion (six-helix bundle) conformation at 1.9 Å resolution. The MARV GP2 core domain backbone conformation is virtually identical to that of EBOV GP2 (reported previously), and consists of a central NHR core trimeric coiled-coil packed against peripheral CHR α-helices and an intervening loop/helix-turn-helix segment. We previously reported that the stability of the MARV GP2 post-fusion structure is highly pH-dependent, with increasing stability at lower pH [Harrison, J.S.; Koellhoffer, J. K.; Chandran, K.; and Lai, J. R. Biochemistry, 2012, 51, 2515–2525]. We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the post-fusion six helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately matured endosomes. In this report, a structural rationale for this pH-dependent stability is described, and involves a high-density array of core and surface acidic side chains at the midsection of the structure, termed the ‘anion stripe.’ In addition, many surface-exposed salt bridges likely contribute to stabilizing the post-fusion structure at low pH. These results provide structural insights into the mechanism of MARV GP2-mediated membrane fusion.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03af37c23288072e5f577079d6338913, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/073de23247c2a5c08d5844a2bc08f9dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0aef080d74958e3be3ece77eaf8dd731, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13d0b69e9a0c3d4d7d671b627330e926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1874fa3781b382c213ea6c6b1ac8a708, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f395a69708f51041e69878f2f9cb905, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2017751a716deabd23790b7ea48fa986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/270c4bcaebdc867ae2992cbed7a220b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28ee9993b44c951d6a105e618382751c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e3a77886cb9f30f44b9abba0c66694e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/364235a47ac0e8b075b552d00d6bb409, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e862c3dec337e4e224a48f987452b89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46034f019da89dbdee6a3beae5c9c390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cc681f14508b7dd1c8426dcbb61e900, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63243b1e7629610022ab93cc893b200e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/634a33b28c7e30ba760538d25467d980, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/659c0b23ca7548b59d29716d7d23fb3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6862032ac123b18fac7dfa8a24b41087, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7854b9f98f2d46f182a6bc4c1e84079f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b38125e8115a71111b9d256fc07fb33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a95c71a9edb307f79b14ac6845d7d40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f6687fc70bb4f45c5fec393198cc8ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/933083bc374f5f19d0214e35218992be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97987f1a594263796fc2bb6635ef8ff3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e02695cf38174abfa56e68b1ce0451f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a188e2cb17335a782c9421a8a3a6aebb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adb50eb8acde3b7883654ae3f516b4c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0b696ed36f67f059b1c445ea9930163, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b11ec8d456903d9ac659168ff695df3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2980c1268147c886b40949209535ffe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b848c526be7a50b471e8e583e02dbc86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c8c1849c565fc1e320cefa069a64fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9d019b7b3dd74a4cc0dfadf508924ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba8c584e2d3841754c7c71219ad2babe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfcb8c496e973f33fc244dcc6b957426, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce9a86d0959a4bea5f7a809021dd09d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d01ea40dd79d369f9c2aacaa04e2dfba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7a3672a495ea2dc48d7f9231b03837a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9f7b4c3214012608b0245d1a5647c2d"

We hypothesized that the most relevant cellular proteases in this process are those closely linked to host cell receptors. The primary receptor for the human severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS) CoV is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 immunoprecipitation captured transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), a known human airway and alveolar protease. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 colocalized on cell surfaces and enhanced the cell entry of both SARS S-pseudotyped HIV and authentic SARS-CoV.

Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation has been established (S. Beushausenet al.(1987).J. Virol.61, 3795–3803). An inducer which accelerates maturation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) also upregulates the expression of the regulatory subunit, R1 of PK1. Since (i) early block preventing infection of mature oligodendrocytes can be bypassed when transfection with genomic RNA is used and (ii) inhibitors of PKs counteract the dbcAMP effect, so as to alleviate the inhibition of JHMV, enhanced expression of R1 appeared to be connected with virus restriction. This idea was confirmed following upregulation of the R1 gene in fully permissive L-2 cells. There was a connection between an effect due to R1 and dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein N by an endosomal phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase) having the properties of types 1 or 2A enzyme which occurs during penetration of inoculum virions. An inhibitionin vitro(cell free) of N dephosphorylation by R1 together with evidence thatin vivo(cell culture) overexpression of R1 inhibited the endosomal PPPase as well as replication of JHMV supports the hypothesis that uncoating of the JHMV inoculum occurs after dephosphorylation, a step obligatory for dissociation of the N protein from the genome. Thus inhibition by R prevents uncoating and thereby interferes with the commencement of replication. These observations intimate the existence of a novel mechanism controlling a virus infection of specific cell target(s) undergoing a process of differentiation and maturation in the central nervous system.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11f10b7fa9a4dedfff049b011e44d136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1433f9452abff35cb89aed6f7d168515, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21f2916330dd2e3a074898770bc6a20d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a7bb2bc5dac5eb027dec988b68f4d5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cae3a0254f3e9ec49a152359de47159, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a8bfc06a1b9a3b0cfe2b8b6dc24fd7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47af249e8691114d9af6a86ba6a24f51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/566771595e8911edd2dfd9374dc526c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c9920892c23ce2a1bc307f3acb29368, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d50fa19a0d31c222ef3305b8e5312c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61d6359b8e38b12577a23dabf5e3a42d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bebed16a9cacdc8073b41c12eceea22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70b1ba2a1906a387945cac5f075c3326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a7b71a27eb839f523e29e288dd4bd7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80f44b7ebd781ffc1c1a8bbe2a0bbc2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82f55d0c55b995cabdc0a559471ccbb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84414a7d6b3ef2f32e307dbfbce7922c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fbd332b6ed099f9673ee90edfa138ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9005bb420b710abbc61ce9a3bfd76b14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98343d7b8bad9c6405e4516769acb9cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aaf4959923ab3b8fe333134a2ff7b469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abdd80cbf1099c19ec60d66e8c2541f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d17a21fda2ba41a2eec3b3676281f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5dbdf8bf55a0ed924df549dd7356857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cad1e81d953a11f0386225f3cf8680af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8881c0aacd5ed89843ada2504e6a9df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2b030b5673574399ed12a74b8fb10cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e419a7412355405a779aaa6a37b82000, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e72cf2e2af0e4f9f455469d1793f6eec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb7b3a4c9c2095bfb7502b7e849bbb6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fce915e2ba189555c338208fd1cc261a"

Therefore, identification of factors in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that are associated with cancer progression may represent novel therapeutic targets. Recent studies have highlighted a previously unappreciated role for the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on T cells and their effects on cell survival and proliferation. TLRs can bind exogenous molecules derived from pathogens as well as endogenous self-ligands released from damaged cells. Recent reports demonstrate that TLR engagement on primary mouse or human T cells enhances proliferation and/or cell survival. The mechanisms by which TLR stimulation on T cells influences these parameters and the different T-cell subsets that are affected by TLR stimulation are currently under investigation. Furthermore, neither the biological importance of stimulating TLRs on neoplastic T cells nor the prevalence of TLR expression in T-cell malignancies have yet to be characterized. Based on published reports and compelling preliminary data, we propose that the activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway in neoplastic T cells contributes to disease progression by reducing cell death and enhancing cell division. In this article, we present both theoretical arguments and experimental data in support of this hypothesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f6996181f26dc8d12575db287d4a164, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14aadd2cf42835af7878b1cf66578492, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15431d6b7191547d2adfa215693bb70c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dff72d8ff6fc0b9e64d2b5da61e48c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1edafbe78a8c9a4c36281f4a0a1cb050, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d0bc217249f1cdfcd9ac647f4dcb496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3662dbbf5ebf156adeb98795a3b1e4cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a69d4b2ac8c8b307a6423d79cd11514, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/477aac2d5c7eaf17e5ea9cd595bc1e51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ccf4d568ef3edaa9a69b1ec16996f33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52081b744a6eb640a14930d495539a61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55e21ef7a16b38e3e32e46ef2d6c6986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57e3dc37cf8b7dbc30c7846b6acab046, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59943c2c6d915b13b39fd4e559025ef3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59c3d13fce75dec28f534463ae9d91e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7488c807fd0252227879a045acad5504, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e8093b6d35a49c21f687c12df938105, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a3e1e2ba920e2e327bc5d2d0d370428, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9de23b4702088a0da95555a0c52c6467, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adb5fec2f404a2def9f8788329ef7186, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aee6a62c70f0d9de0761274706da0677, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d670730ba22f54c5e6a70048d1299733, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e264668ae5a0d1cef4faa4e48759231a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5802fbb094cab2219cd938dc4e6e3e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebe27db09340cce4c4c69296c4461ba2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f092a31e4f17c833eca2915c278e48ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4789f2659a19fd51db0c006b782507e"

Among these, several 5′-O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2′-deoxyriboside (e.g., 5′-O-benzoyl, 5′-O-p-methoxybenzoyl, and 5′-O-benzyl analogues) were found to exhibit effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, the 5′-O-benzoyl analogue exhibited the highest potency with an EC50 of 6.1μM in a cell-based HCV replicon assay. Since the 5′-O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2′-deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC50 =47.2μM), masking of the 5′-hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for the 5′-O-masked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5′-O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06bb9bd465daaa59c65672b05f430bb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b59579c2aa74b2e6b43930946218c63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17213995b9394ee4be4c4c0b63c5ca05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d4e5237cf416586fcb78db074596b31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/252a1e3f763a161b7ee8fe4594401797, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28a1238c3818c907d0d064e4f4c9aa52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b5d55c576929c2a704b9598e89afd6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dd81df093bfa05a9e4917533f8158f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/357cf35ff8466aeee220f5f5b791aa98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46f2bf3cb900d346c30ff96e6dc9c554, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5385a4c42b2e341284564be64c2815a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b7896827ec0b711ec8749822c598014, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63a5b875db6c72f2998d0a41b45bd41e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77fdb7909562357dbeef2af97762ed0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d26884a97f13b2a2b8745250a9b4433, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92403f681860a06b5855593606fb0ef2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9af83d6b5737cc67fb9a1d87015ad876, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acff846dd752df4cb8acb4f6c47a3d00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2f71e8d07a00d4fd2888e3c15a0dbc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de3a2e2b5503101dd8de1c2a3777dade, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e05107dbb0326949cd4528551c0bf1cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3e308615d85416064250f2e9837af5b"

In CD4(+) T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cell-specific Oct1 loss on autoimmune- and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. RESULTS: Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4(+) T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our findings uncover a significant difference between the effect of Oct1 loss on autoimmune and anti-pathogen responses, which potentially could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

We conducted an investigation to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify the disease nature, mode of transmission and risk factors. METHODS: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed case-patients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (± 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. RESULTS: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (OR(M-H) = ∞; 95%CI = 3.7-∞); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (OR(M-H) = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27% (3/11) of cases vs. 14% (11/81) of controls used indomethacin prior to disease onset (OR(M-H) = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36). None of the blood samples were positive for any of the VHFs. CONCLUSION: This reported cluster of hematemesis illness was due to predisposing conditions and use of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). Health education should be conducted on the danger of NSAIDs misuse, especially in persons with pre-disposing conditions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bfeaaec1dfc85783d2d0ee9b3e56069, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/102e79aa38fd05e613522181c090a868, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11576eee8f3e7f039cfe67c5facb9741, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19328292bf4a5b06acf61492ae427db5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26966cf3a39c852cd2446947fe9cf213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27bc453c8b47583d35d88128c9c92aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/417ea5bc71ba6df29493ad9b62a63322, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b308f3bc511e93f7ac11acb5f7ef977, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ca7457fed314455a28d9ea259011a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f4fb5882467160aba3c76783f114f0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53d622f007c73f42ca4e40644178f0f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b5373e0d6a47525cb07d6f6e053aa9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f6ad0c2872159deb7002a83c9473646, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6558f90bc6a115b11428521629b05a1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bddd8061ab734024c74e010ba74fab4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d6ddbb8d0ed4967cb00cbe94db513c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f6514e43e29e3762b15364c78408ce7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4720ccd1659b6ce0781e0ee90ec907a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a72aca5c1d6bf110a0512c2ac6894244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7c866b83e2c524c974873a82d0eec42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3861a85eef59be48b8d153893cfbbe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc08843269aee9155f76940fab1b94ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcea76fe03f7150b7a1882453a4858d6"

Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference can be performed to estimate the parameters in a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, which is a stochastic model for describing a single outbreak of an infectious disease. The package is thus one step towards statistical software supporting parameter estimation, calculation of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for transmission models.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d5e952d121bd32cabd7826063bb340a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2927941315c1413d01a1eb99e6aa23b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a0b548dae12132527642216e5f91612, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/965b121ea123b64e6f7ffed23ea5eaea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a72b4b1836f0240d50951ece7f8d527a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af5c1a8b60c4e57f9b03dd03f6dbbf87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c05501956cb433f9912aee3b31042666, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c28e4219a9ced9d3a2089e006b8c457f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb9c7a61497db7d55467135af980ff7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2307b122f60f542f9eae2a776f62bda"

The disease can be very debilitating with vision loss, motor and sensory disturbances, and cognitive impairment. The clinical course may present as a relapsing‐remitting disease course, a progressive disease course, or a combination thereof. The etiology of MS is unknown. Though many viruses have been shown to be associated with MS, no one virus has ever been demonstrated to be the cause of MS. In addition, MS is thought to have an autoimmune component. Molecular mimicry is one hypothesis put forth which could reconcile the diverse pathology and etiology of MS. Molecular mimicry occurs when peptides from pathogens share sequence or structural similarities with self‐antigens. Infection with various pathogens, each with its individual molecular mimic to a CNS antigen, may explain the inability of investigators to link one specific virus to MS. Molecular mimicry may be mediated through human leukocyte antigen class I‐ and class II‐restricted T cells and antibodies, which may explain the diversity in phenotype. Aspects of molecular mimicry will be discussed in relation to each of these immune system components. Examples of various molecular mimics will be discussed with a particular focus on the CNS and MS. Molecular mimicry alone may not be able to induce disease; priming of the immune system by infection with a pathogen that carries a molecular mimic to self may have to be followed by a later nonspecific immunologic challenge in order for disease to be initiated. Recent research into this priming and triggering of disease will be discussed in relation to an animal model for MS.",""

We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species φ6 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between φ6 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT–φ6 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edge-attached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17395a8a5230a42b13e489e5f1d21173, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a54e7afe2c0322c27e9f6eaf34db57e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/236445996935c24f09bb70e9a84ff6d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28c2d38782bb369bcc7a26fb8958b188, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29dccbd19edc058f64b602288284cbef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52ab9bed59d01fbbb48d9e21ca2d8f2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59478c1317703433983dd377d67fb999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a5bd4665d82a5471ae0bdfe54421d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/600790584fcf9bfd64b5a9d116453169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60823a1027a8f5b5834568a11bd8ca06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6135eed48ce7d9679ca9c3b5d1f7fc91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65d871fe3564b40dd10f0af2fef88e97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66825070f19beee2864c935b4072038b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68d61c804da0f015e8f9383d4572a33b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ce1cf2a9a98900e65e4df424c540aed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a77b73b72c6f75f0fc7aba09920c2ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b4785be1be5d25eaf241b778c994370, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fec14c953579997b673a6b2436e41b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83ddd7eb009583f89efaeecf4e9b014d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a55d6a88d0ca2cdabb1e84eb54fed82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9faea96e17e2625956b64b15c713a92d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4fd315b5d2352eb38b1cc3518b902bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad3f8ba4488f61ce7d86d12ed0789186, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b586ab7ed2e6c69b68b90cb9547a4073, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc47a963bc7f159dc503e4c45714bee9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd31d3237466d7f8ddc9cfbbb36444d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c249d3f40e04c12d6532c8fda3251d12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd0f96a894dbe3043b0d3905faa7b099, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce46f9bc35f24517655034475d7b5b79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7da3c82961317b119cdceddd024915a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1d078d91b2e79d813a8aaf8ce94c011, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8a5e541e5a2ea44fcec5d03beaa4a47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb598216b26b58cb74bd86c69625d334"

We have identified a similar sequence in the N-terminal region of NS5A of hepaciviruses that was recently shown to form an amphipathic α-helix. The conservation of the N-terminal region in two apparently unrelated proteins of two different RNA virus families suggested that this helix might represent an independent module. To test this hypothesis, we constructed chimeric poliovirus (PV) genomes in which the sequence encoding the N-terminal 2C amphipathic helix was replaced by orthologous sequences from other picornaviral genomes or a similar sequence from NS5A of HCV. Effects of the mutations were assessed by measuring the accumulation of viable virus and viral RNA in HeLa cells after transfection, examining membrane morphology in cells expressing chimeric proteins and by in vitro analysis of RNA translation, protein processing and negative strand RNA synthesis in HeLa cell extracts. The chimeras manifested a wide range of growth and RNA synthesis phenotypes. The results are compatible with our hypothesis, although they demonstrate that helix exchangeability may be restricted due to requirements for interactions with other viral components involved in virus replication.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/052a41d3425ee08a50eb5a275ec5a95b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f9c684bde5daad8d3ea6fb2432c46ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18873f0d97915add3523da6dd1f922b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18875f1e4d313e39c5ae9b271deb4be2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d3add7b33c9acb9fe1dd56f37fe9f65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/248a105129ed0729240c3e3f8e98d983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3af9411f44de89a492945d9e184cfc48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42682d0960136fd25038b1ccddbfb6e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4926fd4ad0717931f0b0b76a46a917d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a5cbcc58d97960e2667cc304956110b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d27780e7ba5050470a689d8d173b996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cda728814f71fec8c3b084ef1d74206, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60e23e59434b3f2e0a6fe44457325085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62c95fc5780449f487f25706268d421f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67018673126fe2a88feb18f1a6a0b810, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70e9406c3f058a682ba97e641e8b5960, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e668945a5ae1016c09a587056dc625, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7af07bbb97e9208d2c1ea74fa65b8584, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ba4b7ddd2d7fd6eab27809cdd7f300f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f5e98de7a4ab2ae70f02fa907395add, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a1cad8d0938ad2d3fc7d06d30b1472, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89ed0b23ed529ce033e24657e1d751a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a0655df9070da0e287090f3baa68a96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91202d3ac22b2961045faa1e50f04fc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9de4d22b101b7aa31c80f139710c10ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0e3a9d5ef3299990054dad1442db05a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8d6c594e6196ac66793fe8d2ca11cf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6fba2b521123fff7801cd36f1fa0018, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b70df3a4eb2ae9e5851e5ca0980837d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7ebdcf1f8fd0c71d43077511ffc06ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdb2515f7f76ba4d7d9700de16f69496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf7f49852d8a16ac62841096af898901, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4acae6f18151469b38f1e195c58a29b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c726887eba3469811d7ee6dcace30ef0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc647b1a5671b57a517bc9132e3da21d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd7e280e21670d5d3662fa55da4c3948, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce4c5030182653b64c3782dc5dd2a544, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3a74fac3367dfa50de1bfa73e275258, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbf48b9f7e404fd94af48926ea7b8e21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df3f511c07896acdf7a70afaf255b04c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edac4aa6b3ab430f102dc7b3bdeea0d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efc772456a83a99168ea98cf2926ad19"

Coronaviruses induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), but the role of DMVs in replication and virus fitness remains unclear. Coronaviruses encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), three of which, nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are necessary and sufficient for DMV formation. It has been shown previously that mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 loop 1 that alter nsp4 glycosylation are associated with disrupted DMV formation and result in changes in virus replication and RNA synthesis. However, it is not known whether DMV morphology or another function of nsp4 glycosylation is responsible for effects on virus replication. In this study, we tested whether mutations across nsp4, both alone and in combination with mutations that abolish nsp4 glycosylation, affected DMV formation, replication, and fitness. Residues in nsp4 distinct from glycosylation sites, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal loop 1, independently disrupted both the number and morphology of DMVs and exacerbated DMV changes associated with loss of glycosylation. Mutations that altered DMV morphology but not glycosylation did not affect virus fitness while viruses lacking nsp4 glycosylation exhibited a loss in fitness. The results support the hypothesis that DMV morphology and numbers are not key determinants of virus fitness. The results also suggest that nsp4 glycosylation serves roles in replication in addition to the organization and stability of MHV-induced double-membrane vesicles. IMPORTANCE All positive-sense RNA viruses modify host cytoplasmic membranes for viral replication complex formation. Thus, defining the mechanisms of virus-induced membrane modifications is essential for both understanding virus replication and development of novel approaches to virus inhibition. Coronavirus-induced membrane changes include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes. Three viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, are known to be required for DMV formation. It is unknown how these proteins induce membrane modification or which regions of the proteins are involved in DMV formation and stability. In this study, we show that mutations across nsp4 delay virus replication and disrupt DMV formation and that loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial fitness cost. These results support a critical role for nsp4 in DMV formation and virus fitness.",""

From a metabolic point of view, adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an essential protein in the regulation of the total intracellular and extracellular adenosine in a tissue. In addition to its cytosolic localization, ADA is also expressed as an ecto-enzyme on the surface of different cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26) and some ARs act as binding proteins for extracellular ADA in humans. Since CD26 and ARs interact with ADA at opposite sites, we have investigated if ADA can function as a cell-to-cell communication molecule by bridging the anchoring molecules CD26 and A(2A)R present on the surfaces of the interacting cells. By combining site-directed mutagenesis of ADA amino acids involved in binding to A(2A)R and a modification of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique that allows detection of interactions between two proteins expressed in different cell populations with low steric hindrance (NanoBRET), we show direct evidence of the specific formation of trimeric complexes CD26-ADA-A(2A)R involving two cells. By dynamic mass redistribution assays and ligand binding experiments, we also demonstrate that A(2A)R-NanoLuc fusion proteins are functional. The existence of this ternary complex is in good agreement with the hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells (expressing CD26) and dendritic cells (expressing A(2A)R). This is a new metabolic function for ecto-ADA that, being a single chain protein, it has been considered as an example of moonlighting protein, because it performs more than one functional role (as a catalyst, a costimulator, an allosteric modulator and a cell-to-cell connector) without partitioning these functions in different subunits.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/109ae41ad0ea82eb6cbfa11a850cc7de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17b1c60e89ae57cafe26d6af8546db09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1915864e17a574cf399f6bea6326c3e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b69c3a4ea02b82c066290c1ed069f79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f17c5263d78780e7fc22c505ba31408, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44bfb11a5a5592a86585dfb8241b4c54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/450ae922e7d43755612f35194b7e1c50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ec8656de4c4001edb36d47b25be7a55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5437948fc3774453ff7c09cf2852e704, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54c5eac8ec3b30c85a994674b88df7a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/595dce7fa8226c8d7a08b43e889c4915, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c24b55fd4ce95a5e61115859480b50a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62b0bb42fc42816cb8f100d7dd774e3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e236bcdf21b9daa1e78c3aaebe036c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8aa401d2915b84cb5d18d977a0c9f44c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91109391fb37eafbc885e05baee43cc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f095ed5bd916bbd9838468fb564174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96e98a95503371cd0b1865ed8bc859ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9789698dd2c0d7706969bf45407c1d0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4686fcf39c9819fafeb54792e5f6f58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af125f89d7b78bc73176c87c36ee3bba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afa6d18f73ba6df852c0a7a8a52bcfbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b30bda6cd461f65eed959de771a779a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b76f7e249b86353e021154776180d0b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b57618d56c789823467af02c775827, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c730c9ef33eee542bffc05b260e16fa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cab66c4d36ae431ba4e475ec06f9a4cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce0efb4928d68535dc4087c4b23947b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce29529dda7af2bb457afcb4519d256b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6e342c10d18a9a2bbb79a2b00979663, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0f75a99ca6c3049cdca329fc893de33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4e397b701d9c1681a045e138459b464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5a7c4c06bf7445cea89373508becab9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb77f213897d1b3daed6b77ff6b53447, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb8630278f9bd80c6fee0263f765e3a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eec9ed885cc1a950c45084bb1e5e1069, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9ea6417a3b796ed86861eb67e974c9f"

They are key sensors for a number of infectious agents, some of which are oncogenic, and they launch an immune response against them, normally promoting their eradication. Inherited variations in genes encoding these receptors and proteins and their signaling pathways may affect their function, possibly modulating cancer risk and features of cancer progression. There are numerous studies investigating the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms within or near genes encoding Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors, cancer risk, and features of cancer progression. However, there is an almost total absence of articles analyzing the correlation between polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors and cancer risk or progression. Nevertheless, there is some evidence supporting the hypothesis that inherited C-type lectin receptor and RIG-I-like receptor variants can be associated with increased cancer risk. Certain C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns of potentially oncogenic infectious agents, and certain polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors may have functional consequences at the molecular level that can lead to association of such single nucleotide polymorphisms with risk or progression of some diseases that may modulate cancer risk, so these gene polymorphisms may affect cancer risk indirectly. Polymorphisms of genes encoding C-type lectin receptors and RIG-I-like receptors thereby may be correlated with a risk of lung, oral, esophageal, gastric, colorectal, and liver cancer, as well as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, glioblastoma, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma.

It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. RESULTS: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a “weight” using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.

Thus, chloroquine has found applications in autoimmune diseases where it apparently facilitates apoptosis of abnormally persistent T-cell clones. The mode of action of chloroquine in prevention of malaria is not known, but it may be to minimize replication of the parasite in the liver cells, which occurs before invasion of the erythrocytes, by facilitating premature apoptosis of the infected host cells. After introduction of chloroquine in the 1950s world-wide for prophylactic use, chloroquine-resistant malaria emerged. Here it is hypothesized that concurrent with emergence of chloroquine-resistant malaria (presumably with enhanced anti-apoptotic capabilities), other intracellular parasites have evolved to enhance their ability to prevent apoptosis in host cells. Two examples of viral diseases that have emerged from areas of high incidence of chloroquine-resistant malaria are AIDS from HIV and SARS from coronavirus. The hypothesis holds that prophylactic exposure to pro-apoptotic chloroquine drugs caused natural selection for strains of viruses and other parasites that have enhanced anti-apoptotic abilities. When transmitted to host organisms that are not under the influence of the pro-apoptotic drug, the new “anti-apoptotic” strains may cause unexpected diseases. In the case of SARS, the coronavirus appears to have accessed a new niche where it proves to be lethal to its host. In the case of AIDS, the HIV (which has had a long-term symbiotic relationship with primates) has run amuck because the infected cells are now substantially more tolerant to the toxins (i.e., resistant to apoptosis) that they secrete than the uninfected bystander cells, which are not unusually resistant to apoptosis. A corollary to the hypothesis is that if the level of resistance to apoptosis in the infected cells were no higher than the level of resistance in the bystander cells, then the infected cells would preferentially kill themselves through apoptosis. It appears that in the case of HIV, the increased resistance to apoptosis is provided by expression of Bcl-2 and suppression of p53. Hence, drugs that suppresses Bcl-2 or restore p53 function might be effective in restoring the parity of resistance to apoptosis between infected and uninfected cells. Currently, an antisense drug targeting Bcl-2 (G3139/GenasenseTM, Genta, Inc.) is in late-stage cancer trials and may be on the market for those indications in months. It would be interesting to try these drugs against various intracellular parasites including HIV. This approach to prevent or eliminate active infections might be particularly attractive against a range of parasites (virus, bacteria, protozoa, fungus) when safe and effective vaccines are not available.",""

We hypothesized that the severity of nasopharyngeal cellular injury during URI, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPSs), is related to AOM complication. METHODS: LDH concentrations were determined in NPS samples (n = 594) that were collected at the initial visit for URI from 183 children who were followed for the development of AOM. A subset of NPS samples (n = 134) was analyzed for interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α concentrations. RESULTS: AOM complication was independently predicted by LDH concentrations (median mU/ml with AOM = 2,438 vs. without AOM = 1,573stimate = 0.276; P = 0.02). LDH effect on AOM development was highest during the first 4 d of URI. LDH concentrations were higher in URIs due to adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and rhinoviruses as compared with virus-negative samples (P < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between concentrations of LDH and all cytokines (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: LDH concentrations in NPS are positively associated with AOM risk, suggesting that the severity of nasopharyngeal inflammatory injury during URI contributes to the development of AOM and that reduction of inflammatory injury may reduce the risk for AOM.",""

In vivo immuno-histochemical studies of the liver from infected mice have demonstrated that mechanisms other than direct viral injury are in operation. To examine potential mechanisms, the interaction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Kupffer cells with MHV 3 was studied. We first observed a dramatic inhibition in viral replication in LPS-treated Kupffer cells explanted from A/J resistant mice. Second, we demonstrated that MHV 3 induced a dose-dependent interleukin 1 (IL-1) activity in the supernatants of infected Kupffer cells of both strains. These results led us finally to examine the antigen-proceesing function of the Kupffer cellsof both strains of mice. No striking differences were observed in the ability of Kupffer cells from resistant or sensitive mice to collaborate with immunocompetent lymphocytes. Our data suggest that Kupffer cells play a double role which is crucial in the pathogenesis of MHV 3-induced hepatitis. First, they act directly as the genetically determined sensitivity of mice to MHV 3 infection is correlated with the efficiency of the antiviral activity induced in Kupffer cells by LPS. Second, they act indirectly through the synthesis of different amounts of IL-1 induced by MHV 3. This hypothesis is further borne out by the effects of indomethacin treatment on the course of MHV 3 infection in A/J resistant mice in vivo.",""

To identify differences between antiviral mechanisms in humans and bats, we sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the genome of Rousettus aegyptiacus, a natural reservoir of Marburg virus and the only known reservoir for any filovirus. We found an expanded and diversified KLRC/KLRD family of natural killer cell receptors, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, which dramatically differ from their functional counterparts in other mammals. Such concerted evolution of key components of bat immunity is strongly suggestive of novel modes of antiviral defense. An evaluation of the theoretical function of these genes suggests that an inhibitory immune state may exist in bats. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that tolerance of viral infection, rather than enhanced potency of antiviral defenses, may be a key mechanism by which bats asymptomatically host viruses that are pathogenic in humans.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cb917047b5c9351aa57b192ab6e1f44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e4f5e712490de21923fae317da0ad6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/473b9480e4c6eece68d392bad5640350, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5529dafad07ff8765bf9a960a11cdbfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eb789cc5835fc84667729efe9d28a7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a18047c06809f4541edd98193f67939b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1285def6488fdeddd4a6854b36bfc82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb48b7e965860dea95fe51bb5b08ef89"

We used a genome resequencing approach to resolve the evolutionary history of an important microbial pathogen, the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has been implicated in amphibian declines worldwide. We sequenced the genomes of 29 isolates of Bd from around the world, with an emphasis on North, Central, and South America because of the devastating effect that Bd has had on amphibian populations in the New World. We found a substantial amount of evolutionary complexity in Bd with deep phylogenetic diversity that predates observed global amphibian declines. By investigating the entire genome, we found that even the most recently evolved Bd clade (termed the global panzootic lineage) contained more genetic variation than previously reported. We also found dramatic differences among isolates and among genomic regions in chromosomal copy number and patterns of heterozygosity, suggesting complex and heterogeneous genome dynamics. Finally, we report evidence for selection acting on the Bd genome, supporting the hypothesis that protease genes are important in evolutionary transitions in this group. Bd is considered an emerging pathogen because of its recent effects on amphibians, but our data indicate that it has a complex evolutionary history that predates recent disease outbreaks. Therefore, it is important to consider the contemporary effects of Bd in a broader evolutionary context and identify specific mechanisms that may have led to shifts in virulence in this system.",""

We previously demonstrated that the IFN-γ response at the signaling and gene expression levels is temporally extended in primary mouse hippocampal neurons, as compared to the transient response of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). We hypothesize that the protracted kinetics of STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN-γ-treated neurons are due to extended receptor activation and/or delayed STAT1 dephosphorylation in the nucleus. Here, we show that in response to IFN-γ, the Janus kinases (JAK1/JAK2) associated with the neuronal IFN-γ receptor complex remain active for an extended period as compared to MEF. Experimental inactivation of JAK1/JAK2 in neurons after IFN-γ treatment did not reverse the extended STAT1 phosphorylation phenotype. These results suggest that the extended kinetics of neuronal IFN-γ signaling are a product of distinct negative feedback mechanisms operating at both the receptor and within the nucleus.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f5aef6084cae335d76844d57a934ea5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2067ee585d263dcb61f0c5fecac675d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2975964ccf05136ce8fc0a247f7abd59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a87ea617e4ba9c6010320fda65c4285, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e10852259da29feda1f65fd61b4fc48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3613a5ee5d829f5820e2d89d7a69b70f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4da5fff868a7852dcb2feb1f4e96071f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f11e07648ddf900becd79d9b2ca23db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/522f98849479f27996a67d2d54099df1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5238480bd5a9b776372ddecc19270c91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5400e7d015335fff1c37c3cb19cc9a33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5444b7d2b49ef5957964e06b3470d6d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c8a73e30eb15ba6baa7ce46f6c1f88f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7616ec0868e75eeb42f33b80b40ff4c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78c168d2230912c95b692f7218da21fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ba901af8c6998f0234be55fda2d47aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/805c9da07d0ae316bb97f9ebc28733d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8645bfde3eee4efaa1a092dc5991dff4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dbfea4c5b3a0341b9efd1ec74d428ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90abb45720a449509164174b41433dfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9365b830e34d0c2e8550fdc9057afc43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a254e253b026c29da1034d3e30f04760, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9c17399f001d0d0549ece069e3eca08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abc81b41cd8eb9bceed8801b8e92a324, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac44735d650b12d915f6cb16c93d1ad8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b69b3fa255ff8b959cc7a17541606f0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c78b56970cd132813f80f1487d3cedc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb27d8e3a0b64f5fade331cb4cf5e2ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7fd33fb8ca954061443cdbacce4c649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8879394149a7295869391d5627767ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dab5e168ba9c3c9bd5672a66903708b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e458a95acffccdb557ecf11823713a04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6a9b3e46feb3fcf01d9d916a32a0750, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb9dd57072bc19798e5c2232814bfa15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f117051d01c4647f72a9003e3a5a440e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f63994c56dfd8cc91d3c4d9cd2852823, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d39f6eaeadc8d8847699fef783a755, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff98cdc50bc07d433e90fde53c435dc2"

In contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses where recombination events are frequent, the evolutionary dynamic within the MTBFG was believed to be essentially clonal. This assumption was challenged with the recent report of several homologous recombinations within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). We performed a thorough analysis of publicly available genomes in this group and found no compelling evidence for the previously identified recombinations. However, our results show for the first time that demonstrable recombination (i.e., with large statistical support and strong phylogenetic evidences) has occurred in the MTBFG, more specifically within the Louping ill virus lineage. Putative parents, recombinant strains and breakpoints were further tested for statistical significance using phylogenetic methods. We investigated the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a Bayesian framework. The recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of 282 to 76 years before the present. By unravelling the temporal setting of the event, we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account for the observed recombination.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/038015c164c5b20cbad64d32cec3ab12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/121e1355c1e8dd11b168fa8e23a13a1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22db7e40edd5611f2ee6321ceba9be53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c358c4582bfd83cd6ebcfae3dea7655, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35c44d9c6683f9d9dcf524b61fe757d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cdf8dc26dacaba96ebe2cb82a8e8ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/443eb9c054c06894fa7c1abd8699251a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/487c75e2f3131180a03cc6bede9ae180, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/502cf8302f9050b6d999f9876b432363, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ce6a0f53b158ad61f4324d6e0ea6781, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/769a6c7ae06ae55e75ba7625ab450d1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8629efb716f37da4949623293e4c9d91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86cf8d83f94be4d217659a27d70daa20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a58c4502964e6b65dc0785d1843b7b2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c40f650bbfd8977332c91ce235d1bc33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4be94f561fe23087ce1c303c24b85d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c67d89c45daf0e1dd6d31251c49d94b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbcd590c4de4e87ce948fe4b77181750, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6419dc06f880daab4f9d5dbd9ebbba3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d78970935fb1befc46cab5d9bf515e52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e37dccbb19c6dca7927a9b5603b55ec5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e65582866706aed98eaf8854ec9fe25f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed4a5db7314693b3689e44cabaf3b7cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef19c3722b7c3735c704c234275c9e93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faed8ceea8dbe3507476f9ee1505b659"

To investigate the ability of PV to persist in the spinal cord after the onset of paralysis, we exploited a mouse model in which most animals inoculated with a mouse-adapted mutant survived after the onset of paralysis. Light microscopy and ultrastructural immunohistochemical studies and reverse transcription followed by nested PCR performed on spinal cord from paralyzed mice demonstrated that PV persisted in the mouse spinal cord for at least 12 months after the onset of paralysis.

But these therapies are very often of limited efficacy or have severe side effects. Therefore there is great interest in developing new efficacious and safe antiviral compounds e.g. based on the identification of compounds of herbal origin. Hypothesis Since an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill. shows antiviral activity against viruses causing infections of the upper respiratory tract in vitro we hypothesised that a product containing it such as Biaron C® could have an antiviral activity too. Study design Antiviral activity of Bioaron C®, an herbal medicinal product consisting of an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill., Vitamin C, and Aronia melanocarpa Elliot. succus, added as an excipient, was tested in vitro against a broad panel of viruses involved in upper respiratory tract infections. Methods These studies included human adenovirus and several RNA viruses and were performed either with plaque reduction assays or with tests for the detection of a virus-caused cytopathic effect. Results Our studies demonstrated an impressive activity of Bioaron C® against members of the orthomyxoviridae – influenza A and influenza B viruses. Replication of both analysed influenza A virus strains – H1N1 and H3N2 – as well as replication of two analysed influenza B viruses – strains Yamagatal and Beiying – was significantly reduced after addition of Bioaron C® to the infected cell cultures. In contrast antiviral activity of Bioaron C® against other RNA viruses showed a heterogeneous pattern. Bioaron C® inhibited the replication of human rhinovirus and coxsackievirus, both viruses belonging to the family of picornaviridae and both representing non-enveloped RNA viruses. In vitro infections with respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus, both belonging to the paramyxoviridae, were only poorly blocked by the test substance. No antiviral activity of Bioaron C® was detected against adenovirus – a non-enveloped DNA virus. Conclusions These results represent the first proof of a selective antiviral activity of Bioaron C® against influenza viruses and create basis for further analyses of type and molecular mechanisms of the antiviral activity of this herbal medicine.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0aee2f6ae65c55469e8a78bd510c388c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/157290965363d9ce8a25bbd2d792a88e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/161398c1139c72f1b503d89123d60b27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fd83c5feb4247b9a2500b0facb5a553, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2168371807d974f0871363c3c16fd46a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22390a7caa9cbd9494627affb7917d7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22f0112759faae9c436f067ac8a13149, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23c02528decdd91d265bf640788a5512, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f6840a379c7196614991a953f766ede, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37520b3be5534510a1200785f1dd01a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d3481ed9fc06c798b4c229ceae66e16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ddcc304681528eec321eeaec99eec34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47c70d8e17ef49358e6631367859ee9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4af60c192d43e18760ef2cf4f57884ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c7826a5263bdd4c3747e3361bc050a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f70a11773bc8ba02eea070fad6b62bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51754fc93c23a7e693070ee47980271a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/564f7863b1e2bdedf1599a3315b93156, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688887b0c2e1a25cc833fc16c6d91d14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ac6848b1a728552712d485972379a45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d94c87a6ef20d065f7b18c2389f58b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e81499a976dbd09d0c843587d54142f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ef4b873d8cf4c51d362e7243874e5f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72378000ee94f9d28691f17a27dc1038, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78a7c6288e5fdb1eebcbe20df512683e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dee28ab8d4913c43bf41fafb571c4b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ab832c92b9ea21a598156657f523931, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c2dca32781cf0521976ded0b368dd20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/911f8e4e0350b2ad5b6ee0c90efc8a12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ca624d89529419b35accd3f1cbe3c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a20d75e77613b7814208d5b5830dd8d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a31076036e27abef96c1b952c2ac7633, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a46c4750b3af1591ed4f0d22254682d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a49d223022ba4a8c7316e49e0a4fbf9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5b6b177817224d49406c5f2655a0a0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af6b7eb5b9a582cec8aadf5927a9368c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b36ed60f68c7ad0e16251bf667f0afb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3bdae51f2dbb18d8fff48e8fab06847, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/befcdba3ce6b7ef3b1418b58e613663e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c444d04e1746ddce6ef9fa437ae1e0ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d873bceaf4ac45d4d7ddcee0359ade83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d91235c8413de640efd0e44520a6d771, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da705f7ebda1abd38b4b43fbfa5bbddd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd2310641cec539944c1feb07922e505, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7087adc0024bdf0e3c09b55bd3e1091, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb97c39bd82ecb88437e879f165b9e59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb8e1a36666ca561c8b9e1904a3e0f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f33e37033d956d7ffcaa02592a17290c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5cdcd1617c8cf923c90cd86532271be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f86b28cbf8dcd990bcdfba397710f1cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9ae43434edd261b188e84a5e02a92a2"

The absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease. Previous work has suggested that SJL/J mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC, leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis. We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-γ injections. Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, α-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-γ. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-γ, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with α-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with α-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis. Thus, autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c0d0cf4d5987b08a8607e270a64e940, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ca9210dd6702ea91a62ea9a5c7c56b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e484327692798715b0ce1e6b599c712, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a91a8a3a6f1ea53c93863f32c54564e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b5790547e025444bdfb095b90617962, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f742916278030fd20273c5a8dfa7b52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33f46be454754ac598adab41a1f431ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/375de53d944636eef731b9d8d8b81f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c2a1f46a95a63fd094a235df51381c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40e6320b6fbf6c5bf65cdf2702cb81fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d76d0b0e474f58337e9c18d0c8c6e88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/519799b8ed88e7d422f3b3eb1db7a96b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52fc4d9fb029fc69af47b73c35fe5914, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c28de3a236fff9e2c4399b7b988b9ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cebfefb06560dc6cdb554a456b56f01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cf5c98662b086cceaccbca48357d497, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ea13f89bf49351036693a23a88e321c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6306a4848b6ff1a76729b85d5e6036a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a5c3d274ab4afeefc7ff93467fcfefb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d87d5228d45121b0a457a69fc170803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7648bca88d19472f3cf8148640168fda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ac3e559eae9f083fa7c8d50b2881e05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e9cd15073b03a310a1188d97b20afd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/884295de9558a033640291e6399ddfbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c136408718a78dba31a657eff176e3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c88fc04b7ebf265a96eb07188b8f675, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90a3dae92226b1e29e280aafa2fc1c17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f8b733d1c1959c7ccc9ca7c3f782f94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2d37cea2bcadd7d433fea7f65ede5a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a33ff384743fddcefbbb586f67238b1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9004dfa527526d84fe0f61e44245350, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b68fd847ad99a874febbcc277ff9776f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c129295baff8247da9bc584a3e3ea3c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4b91d974a5c79689702c2bbe0e48179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c557df4db0d8c662cdd399eb1ae428c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1288bf570747ed2042d2e3f7c1f3fc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/def72c163c73433eaea97d3ada10403a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9c94088d222bdc48a8b1e7e620ac180, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb47a26493c6e14475f26b2ae7edf825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1861b0e6378993829ddf968f9785ba0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f60c8d37bbda394392b7a6855a931d0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7397cbaca413c01f592db4cc02bd0d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8009b28511ca69e90610ab0d5212839, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/feb58a78671c20de235d7c3014f9bdb1"

Therefore, discovering additional therapeutic options would be a valuable aid to public health. Recently, TLR4 inhibition has emerged as a possible mechanism for protection against influenza-associated lethality and acute lung injury. Based on recent data showing that rhesus macaque θ-defensins could inhibit TLR4-dependent gene expression, we tested the hypothesis that a novel θ-defensin, retrocyclin (RC)-101, could disrupt TLR4-dependent signaling and protect against viral infection. In this study, RC-101, a variant of the humanized θ-defensin RC-1, blocked TLR4-mediated gene expression in mouse and human macrophages in response to LPS, targeting both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways. In a cell-free assay, RC-101 neutralized the biologic activity of LPS at doses ranging from 0.5 to 50 EU/ml, consistent with data showing that RC-101 binds biotinylated LPS. The action of RC-101 was not limited to the TLR4 pathway because RC-101 treatment of macrophages also inhibited gene expression in response to a TLR2 agonist, Pam3CSK4, but failed to bind that biotinylated agonist. Mouse macrophages infected in vitro with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 influenza A virus (PR8) also produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene products in a TLR4-independent fashion when treated with RC-101. Finally, RC-101 decreased both the lethality and clinical severity associated with PR8 infection in mice. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that RC-101 exhibits therapeutic potential for the mitigation of influenza-related morbidity and mortality, potentially acting through TLR-dependent and TLR-independent mechanisms.",""

Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a3f921fb6b5b473f5be7a8770c1a419, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d7d7ee5a82e85a3caf4333c041f2c3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2169b8f63e35878109859d06aaa8a3f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/233c978456fce990906a05bb1ae2372a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31b03fb73358d6589869be063cafc635, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e937e830ece6717870796d4eb819816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/782faa5191712cc2ea7c8886998271a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9776de03ea3c560b749f4695d6ec5157, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a02cc309839f55cc3364a32212ed05b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b007e88d9e51811ee64fd5ea7eaa9f38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2a2ae10f6142489b25baf504dbbb21f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd52dccd7e9dae9bad13621355a68be3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a99cad1c783a03b9b98fcf3dfc41af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcb7f6eb10669473e1c9ca28e435dd19"

The prominent benefits of TFs have been well documented. Amount of research were conducted and excellent achievements were disclosed during the past years. However, as far as we know, there is no comprehensive review about TFs. Scope and approach: This review summarized the recent research progress. The activity of TFs on anti-oxidation, anti-mutagenicity, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral effect as well as the epidemiological cure were sorted. Converging pioneer literature and deduction, the underlying formation mechanism of TFs was proposed. Subsequently, acquisition of TFs was pointed out to be the fundament for further research. Accelerated by enzyme, bio-synthesis of TFs were reviewed simultaneously. At the end, employing modern analysis instrument and technology, isolations of TFs were enumerated. Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs. Meanwhile, oxidation pathway of two catechin molecules to form TFs were hypothesized. Also, ascertainment of the several therapeutic efficiency of the family members of TFs would be the next step in the future.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05cac029007b482b82967e588e33bcd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b4e537620be1e6d568df02287182caf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f898c8c68fa808199f5c1d10ee361b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f552f5d00f991e038354fedce87cc45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3af5272c562add68b1eb0da1b102061c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5feb22e3c433fe000d60c1751afd23f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6202430a0b55f298ce1f048e82dc8270, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78646ef59a8ff2b0e6e41ed023a792a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d466dff49baabe1f50fd2eb3d68c3b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/867c7cbe0cf8d3f98f1af06cd2cdef2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ebe27b28b454da5bdce4aa2bde9a854, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91e20e36935e26ccaac8978b94345f1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a3b134fc7b920d695c469cade6abc09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a87def226e386d7b242421c13da795cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3cba6a37bf4550a5688bf4423433e6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0cd6102fb30bd2d5915b8ac17d88c98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9fc5516f6f17cd739fd2a45810ba7de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea7a0d886dbc2ddfb0e40b8b72592c87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f06342b3bd239c3160181101dede620c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f39a934d1f7104f9c3681aa9aca3609b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f555337b8be7d69f5d63588eebcbf26c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7b8ec027b82c33db4509d4849a1fdf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff0abd4f953956fbe36eec5bb09f74f8"

Structural information on this crucial protein from the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which is lethally pathogenic and has caused severe respiratory diseases worldwide, is lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 at a 2.7-Å resolution and performed the relevant biochemical assays to study how NendoU activity is regulated. Although the overall structure is conserved, MERS-CoV Nsp15 shows unique and novel features compared to its homologs. Serine substitution of residue F285, which harbors an aromatic side chain that disturbs RNA binding compared with that of other homologs, increases catalytic activity. Mutations of residues residing on the oligomerization interfaces that distort hexamerization, namely, N38A, Y58A, and N157A, decrease thermostability, decrease affinity of binding with RNA, and reduce the NendoU activity of Nsp15. In contrast, mutant D39A exhibits increased activity and a higher substrate binding capacity. Importantly, Nsp8 was found to interact with both monomeric and hexameric Nsp15. The Nsp7/Nsp8 complex displays a higher binding affinity for Nsp15. Furthermore, Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex also enhance the NendoU activity of hexameric Nsp15 in vitro. Taking the findings together, this work first provides evidence on how the activity of Nsp15 may be functionally mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, RNA binding efficiency, or the possible association with other nonstructural proteins. IMPORTANCE The lethally pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) pose serious threats to humans. Endoribonuclease Nsp15 encoded by coronavirus plays an important role in viral infection and pathogenesis. This study determines the structure of MERS-CoV Nsp15 and demonstrates how the catalytic activity of this protein is potentially mediated, thereby providing structural and functional evidence for developing antiviral drugs. We also hypothesize that the primase-like protein Nsp8 and the Nsp7/Nsp8 complex may interact with Nsp15 and affect enzymatic activity. This contributes to the understanding of the association of Nsp15 with the viral replication and transcription machinery.",""

Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine strains.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/026195a02fd06232b1e6f636c9e449ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08c9c43570c52c8053c51e9c6bb6fe5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bc6ffbab773aca20fc31a0d0beab91b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27ac3863271fa746717d2b333d43a390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ae5a072e4dff6b7d7de4f414231e877, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38cddc0e29bb9d47d1d0e1b51625cd42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44751e95e013fd4bbafcce5f2d7775fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cbe08ae3306f6c7ed7f257b8b7ff1bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e5f3cdc1fd0830e5886dbd7d1bc83b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50e299168c01f25e787fd4f028030aaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5642ceb930b3aab7fb594638b42c97fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5925e27a34641eddb5730b3f83aa82fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76e9df44a81773a0e404fa422b0c8c21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/791f228501b0490eefe13dc21bf5e5d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90a66434b8365b0eb76a1daf2186bb63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/950eb70e759ccab5a6905d80e3b6c116, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7420c864dca4ff4b91672b343457d89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eecf21705a0e15ed2ce8b3b6618c2d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f73fdb502612617bb869fad9465fff41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f899ed708dea931edcb86b99e5f84a14"

Clinical, epidemiological, and virological evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses contribute to human mental diseases whose etiology remains elusive. Therefore, the investigation of the mechanisms whereby viruses persist in the CNS and disturb normal brain function represents an area of research relevant to clinical and basic neurosciences. Borna disease virus (BDV) causes CNS disease in several vertebrate species characterized by behavioral abnormalities. Based on its unique features, BDV represents the prototype of a new virus family. BDV provides an important model for the investigation of the mechanisms and consequences of viral persistence in the CNS. The BDV paradigm is amenable to study virus–cell interactions in the CNS that can lead to neurodevelopmental abnormalities, immune-mediated damage, as well as alterations in cell differentiated functions that affect brain homeostasis.

We focus on the host–pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health. These concepts and methods are applicable to a wide range of pathogens that affect humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eee573b2fa76cd5ee988764fca8e3c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d8038dab5e320e6bd9dbdd6a2be0bc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dfcc7058d8837a5f863c158bf65c29a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fce4b1bddb3617dcd1fd8de243a49c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/218de27e33b571fbf9af2a5c95ea0591, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cf1e712238c13a259762462ac8af899, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35aa92dd9ccf6a34b7a05f219cab4616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3907aee8d4cb14ddb2e7b0312c2396fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f62494da754194abd02790e46fce54c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a4f7b941fe5d79204696c61f608825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c0e28c4d50c97e31523ff381163b5f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50bb8d2b1228e8aee6234e1761c1f7f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d35335034c1027c229438474255ba04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d4cf19407ae841f510b67eed9f56538, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77fedc3083d67161e0e31c6bfb8d5aa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80dcfa764f9231462ed3ab01b9e84745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c5ff698c40e116026ed040393a146be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f2a00f3efe0e5e06ebd5717fed49f01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fa71fd953ba42534d5b0b3ff6cc09c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9399a2031483405a55be6c28210a1e13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9585c499e9608ee79bd3bd17ff80bf19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a09f9261d35279b3e2fce67e4ab5ad7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0e7c3be74c4641a8d788d8b8dcee936, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a79c817cb1d44549724478873ab95726, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a81a89750fbb2f987a0c10eb761bbb69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3217d1f2c693cb12b0b8b1433c07025, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4964e2c046083cd14d03c0676a14071, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b837158a0f418b6b83c2489ea095e91e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9a0a40730a558acb36522d3041155e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bde96ad57503ab02ec125ac52ccf16c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d161ef0715e44ad33867f3eb0a2e36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4137e16a822050a4129822f996a686d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4dc7b2511733cbc992f43963eeba718, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d68388c80db622031fc93c734ab36f75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e12805666d075af4b0c1008f38888634, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f05cb4e58bbcd50139ee30d66ace4256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb7cc14548c4f06e4c894e1abd38981f"

This study used the Illumina HT_12 microarray platform and quantitative real time PCR (QPCR) to perform mRNA expression profiling on 114 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 80 non-psychiatric controls from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). Differential expression analysis revealed altered expression of 164 genes (59 up-regulated and 105 down-regulated) in the PBMCs from patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Bioinformatic analysis indicated significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes known to be involved or associated with immune function and regulating the immune response. The differential expression of 6 genes, EIF2C2 (Ago 2), MEF2D, EVL, PI3, S100A12 and DEFA4 was confirmed by QPCR. Genome-wide expression analysis of PBMCs from individuals with schizophrenia was characterized by the alteration of genes with immune system function, supporting the hypothesis that the disorder has a significant immunological component in its etiology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/051239f6cac01f51fb83a16a646f2c44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09cf83161bbdca7355bc8b16fd50b923, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a2cb58390583ae43436754aa99d360c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ea46b306ac3446c5a055186659bca8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1230cabb3e5e56fd9854f0577303eec8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/209c1761107363a384b9e58ee25df02f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23b67d7dbc936664326b6a9bc2875482, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/322086db311bcd387ccb5a63c4a3dadf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a8a3f4ee9fd771c75ce7d3acc6fa6ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a93c57fbb9d85881364d4766b776b17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/538aacac81426199486da709810d145c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56d470b84600e1d82cc00cac5ca93569, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56ed583b546dbac6b7d43d8f9bb8e844, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b00cec818b89e24f82e33572740d05a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c39cb83d17f3cb2aa1c24e5d29eac5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/608a6de35b940c415fc38983c189de95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b42a0299d5fdedcdcf203f82aca7e35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e5311e7e865fda22f2a7bf8f60b3b29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d3e8da541652bf72bb998623623d2b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80ac1d4ae0477204d0cdf80e04fd7179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88795e5e72b477b2b6e18046e5502713, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/895d36ead0a99ca48d41becf34da52fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9431656d27f6526ee650d8d691b953b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c50a12cb6842dbfaf0097f5c809a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aca0f4082998ccb51652959e5c62d7d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aea62fa7661130fc7b87988ec6aa8e2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdd30cde871a4474d5076f8bc3b985c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d88f67124b5da624d17ea6f347d4406c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de1963cfe9032de14109a32a8b476f07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e31b8b56e999c49be7c117b8ce4f6520, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e73c7d425a3e624e93a78cbbf3c8cd21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f36d7b0cd71d2e0bbea3cc2e73c8324f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f74d9b48a673203c20746d812da84564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb8eb3931aea8c8f679c5e7a755e7e0e"

Most existing studies of herpes viruses have used small populations and postdiagnosis specimens. As part of a larger research program, we conducted a hypothesis-generating case-control study of selected herpes virus antibodies among individuals discharged from the US military with schizophrenia and pre- and postdiagnosis sera. Methods: Cases (n = 180) were servicemembers hospitalized and discharged from military service with schizophrenia. Controls, 3:1 matched on several factors, were members not discharged. The military routinely collects and stores members' serum specimens. We used microplate enzyme immunoassay to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels to 6 herpes viruses in pre- and postdiagnosis specimens. Conditional logistic regression was used, and the measure of association was the hazard ratio (HR). Results: Overall, we found a significant association between human herpes virus type 6 and schizophrenia, with an HR of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04, 1.32). Women and blacks had significant negative associations with herpes simplex virus type 2 and cytomegalovirus; among blacks, there was a significant positive association with herpes simplex virus type 1. Among men, there was a HHV-6 temporal effect with an HR of 1.41 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.96) for sera drawn 6–12 months before diagnosis. Discussion: Findings from previous studies of herpes family viruses and schizophrenia have been inconsistent. Our study is based on a larger population than most previous studies and used serum specimens collected before onset of illness. This study adds to the body of knowledge and provides testable hypotheses for follow-on studies.",""

Precision public health is a state-of-the-art concept in public health research and its application in health care. Application of information technology in field of epidemiology paves the way to its transformation to digital epidemiology. A geospatial epidemiological model was simulated to estimate the spread of Ebola virus disease after a hypothetical outbreak in India. Methods. It was a simulation study based on SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) compartmental model. Simulation was done in Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler (STEM). Epidemiological profile of Ebola virus, that transmitted throughout the Sierra Leon in 2014–2016, was fitted into the SEIR deterministic compartment model designed for India. Result. Spatiotemporal distribution of EVD exposed, infectious, and recovered population at 4-month interval represented by different figures. It is estimated that if no intervention is taken to stop the spread, within 2 years, almost half of the country will be effected by EVD and cumulative number of exposed individuals, infectious persons, and deaths will be 106947760, 30651674, and 18391005, respectively. Conclusion. Precision public health may play the key role to achieve the health related targets in the Sustainable Development Goals. Policy makers, public health specialists, and data scientists need to put their hands together to make precision public health a reality.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/021776e66b6ad49bccf578e771f816e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16587f0e55840fad0d6c8c545c0b4457, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/230f91844c90ccce47fdf99fedd3a42b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ba82e877305faf846b3f6f9087dd6ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c04cc1c61f18083a85bddefc384ee1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eb73dc87df71e1aeb3193460ea74fc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82f40ff37168bc14f2f372646c674aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8573872b9ae26f79802f904c447124a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86ae6f654914f7eddf3b5cd2951e2136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b0b8870b902fbec62e69267fa0844a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f3c55e282bdfa319df17bdb8dc7df62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3856a0bca6de5a56c666a2887c23ecb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3ae234502896e0343a0ae636ff98ba4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5485c44c1fbfcdecbde4d16ee9bed80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbca8365198d500a1399d38a1ad3871d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd0fef9958c36abd2f37cc94980fd6f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df06c6ab5b30f4991bc2487d221c66d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1bbc61a2c85bed2ce3c8c2467dbdeb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec55841d62542a9041b61c17bb3a7cc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec9e1257a6352b43bde434507eb0e142, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f49d0e83e4a4cca46dffab45de4a778a"

Although two proteins (vp4 and vp7) are probably important in inducing protection against challenge, it has not been clearly demonstrated that inclusion of the epidemiologically important human P or G type is important in protection against human disease. No immunological effector arm clearly explains protection against heterotypic challenge. Protection against disease is not predicted by rotavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies in serum. Oral inoculation may not be necessary to induce a protective, virus-specific immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface, but parenteral inoculation of experimental animals with rotavirus induces an immune response at the intestinal mucosal surface that is protective against challenge. Induction of a rotavirus-specific protective immune response is probably associated with the presence of virus-specific T and B cells in intestinal lymphoid tissues and virus-specific sIgA or IgG at the intestinal mucosal surface. There is some experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that neither rotavirus replication nor presentation of rotavirus antigen to the intestinal mucosal surface is necessary to achieve this aim.",""

METHODS: The most characteristic findings and the pending controversies were derived from a literature review and previous personal experiences. A single paragraph focused on some atypical examples of the disease presenting under confounding pretences. RESULTS: Headache, visual field alterations and impaired pituitary secretion are the most frequent clinical findings of the disease. Pituitary biopsy, still considered the gold diagnostic standard, does not always receive consent from the patients. The role of magnetic resonance imaging is limited, as this disease may generate images similar to those of other diseases. The role of antipituitary and antihypothalamus antibodies is still discussed owing to methodological difficulties and also because the findings on the true pituitary antigen(s) are still debated. However, the low sensitivity and specificity of immunofluorescence, one of the more widely employed methods to detect these antibodies, may be improved, considering a predetermined cut-off titre and a particular kind of immunostaining. CONCLUSION: Autoimmune hypophysitis is a multifaceted disease, which may certainly be diagnosed by pituitary biopsy. However, the possible different clinical, laboratory and imaging features must be considered by the physician to avoid a misdiagnosis when examining a possibly affected patient. Therapeutic choice has to be made taking into account the clinical conditions and the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary involvement, but also considering that spontaneous remissions can occur.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ad4b59a378fce53e35b0c854c701b15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7acb0cc6696a795edb422bf25194fa87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad131845c75e125b6832c945f93987eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd288e69d98dbec68f628f4938da3db4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cedeffdec85012869f9bbb8492a11c95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbb8227aa97e6b17cdf8430fe54230c2"

As RIG-I is absent in chickens, MDA5 is hypothesized to be important in detecting viral nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) expression has yet to be fully elucidated. With this in mind, a ∼2.5kb chMDA5 gene promoter region was examined and PCR amplified to assess its role in immune response. A chMDA5 promoter reporter plasmid (piggybac-MDA5-DsRed) was constructed and transfected into DF-1 cells to establish a Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line. The MDA5 promoter activity was extremely low under basal condition, but was dramatically increased when cells were stimulated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), interferon beta (IFN-β) or Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV). The DsRed mRNA level represented the promoter activity and was remarkably increased, which matched the expression of endogenous MDA5. However, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to increase the MDA5 promoter activity and the expression of endogenous MDA5. The results indicated that the promoter and the Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line could be utilized to determine whether a ligand regulates MDA5 expression. For the first time, this study provides a tool for testing chMDA5 expression and regulation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08495e7f1632f7793a9de8d3242937af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ad77322592052a7c295101aa3a6ef81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bbeeed8f224f862c462dad2579f763d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cff1c497723d106a7e136ce448f1859, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d011a444f2c3ce8601eabb3693a3fd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/131cf43fc4855a5bbd9ac4693617dc7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37553babc793d2124f67260a87acbf17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c3f389c8d04eff16f55598850279dc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dcc2d67460bbefc5ef925e5d0de99ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f61e0c44e2208e1ddd01ff7ec92c81e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/418c1cf1c77f89299fcef1f79aa81fa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44f567c2459b11ca7edf6494eacfd472, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4787754c75ddc75fcb0d1cb698ce9a21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47f959b3acc3fbd86e4f3c8dcc0ba857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/499ca921f860831bf77d57f1b3650d21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a18eadf78a759171e16e7cca934643f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dab3e9f1b0c965f7c8fdbce1048c579, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/557ca8b50b6ec83f8feb1d1714c30950, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5745cd7f8e44f3e9cfd020fd781a0590, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c4898eb328506ef8b33c880a490ff40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c92f65e088ac9f7bb9e46040aeb4c3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/699e160bae05fc1f97cb9831c3506d0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d5532ddd402b46ded1cc72ecf3fabf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70fab6fbf2c54adc66e25f6f837d698a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/734d1fc2d9394fb7d211ad1a200ae76c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7aa58e81134e3fd40106466c43810540, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/855d9322307b43b321e5e090421adfe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e8f98e56267a440f93c0888381d2931, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94ab368c6848b2570595c7fd5f5fe254, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1ed559381b19eb1310a3a2391d21ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6c85b515f9f7b514942c762d5638b69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b757958b6a2764e8f2a57b1853bf2a5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc7c5e815d4b7ad1119e1dde5c521468, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcbcf0e7747b34e7ca610a4d5e58d0d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c23e25169aafbcff485384c46abe54f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c928ac67e6e552605fe33569101bd116, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc3a27ed00aac9666c1163cd742a5b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc565331cf68267d62f96b3b6d782eae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7b7ecee8e65fd6758060ad69dc93765, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef07bc9410a5506cf00296b519cbb9d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f378e7c6eebf389ee2e8fd0b2befc03f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f670c73b1516d2ce1b377811f9b2b5a2"

Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT(2) receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the renin-angiotensin system, and the AT(2) receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology, and prompt more uniform assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003a904c0020c114aec4a5441e85c38a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d8b9d69331e006a1796bc09d4383e60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f96264ef1722af9d48e66909ce21f76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fdc9fb349765ff2d1a9c84a129a087d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14064133bde95f223b5215d1658daa5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/184fba7924693b28aee88acb8cebf34b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/205301d6c2cf8083c7a09a43b96608bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f97fb3699d875e3865ace809742599, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c029a568627fba1373400e926759210, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f3d664b63db768fd08275a0a0628522, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/414ada0282de2b78ba6c8aede4007c4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4826dc73a3bf0832ce3416afc2f3bb4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d8d8fb580ea8c02de65f826de29d9d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4efdead19166723987acd95b19569688, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5445efe2d208b490457bae86d1a40b1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5561731a8ed0ad358da9c4ecf8c1228c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/792375c6d0113121ef6af87b23c5d805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d8cb42acdf72cb7a732b76c77ab422f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e25f59cec4dcd2cd579b1d01cf07825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8591341471ce687b40dfa1376d24a329, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/890be85f1ed077eac06e6137ba5e4a31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9681dffc19a6edd544ca7618d8bdb02d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9704997ae272efbc2e1232a568c8a6c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c1a1ddfe7925db5f633290f97eee6f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e6758a8dda432fcd20e3c6cb9e6bb53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2f8db3420b4f30f22d99b5d0eb078de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a62719f0c5e1350a60b3ed806cf53e79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8b346b115d321d58a96040e9998b873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6d332683c0b35ee1c69679df179359f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3bb31765f22a9aeb41318f8710171e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db224a7c9852e40a5b87a01fbcd9cd45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec89513bf540e63da92c527fa5a769d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec97642c9d011f9184500b54997de2ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d5050dcaab2bf942e57019dd34d0bc"

One reason for the lack of therapeutic options might be that ALI is a co-morbid event associated with a diverse family of diseases and, thus, may be the result of distinct pathological processes. Among them, activated neutrophil- (PMN-) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward. Several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses, with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ALI. With this in mind, we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ALI briefly, emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating PMN and/or lung epithelial cell responses. In addition, the contribution that Fas-mediated inflammation may play as a potential biological link between lung cell apoptosis and PMN recruitment will be considered, as well as the in vivo application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) as a novel approach to the inhibition of ALI and its therapeutic implications.",""

However, the hypothesis of codivergence between dsDNA viruses and their hosts has rarely been rigorously tested, even though the vast majority of nucleotide substitution rate estimates for dsDNA viruses are based upon this assumption. It is therefore important to estimate the evolutionary rates of dsDNA viruses independent of the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Here, we explore the use of temporally structured sequence data within a Bayesian framework to estimate the evolutionary rates for seven human dsDNA viruses, including variola virus (VARV) (the causative agent of smallpox) and herpes simplex virus-1. Our analyses reveal that although the VARV genome is likely to evolve at a rate of approximately 1 × 10(−5) substitutions/site/year and hence approaching that of many RNA viruses, the evolutionary rates of many other dsDNA viruses remain problematic to estimate. Synthetic data sets were constructed to inform our interpretation of the substitution rates estimated for these dsDNA viruses and the analysis of these demonstrated that given a sequence data set of appropriate length and sampling depth, it is possible to use time-structured analyses to estimate the substitution rates of many dsDNA viruses independently from the assumption of host-virus codivergence. Finally, the discovery that some dsDNA viruses may evolve at rates approaching those of RNA viruses has important implications for our understanding of the long-term evolutionary history and emergence potential of this major group of viruses.",""

With inbreeding nearly complete, we estimated the extinction rate among CC lines at a remarkable 95%, which is substantially higher than in the derivation of other mouse recombinant inbred populations. Here, we report genome-wide allele frequencies in 347 extinct CC lines. Contrary to expectations, autosomes had equal allelic contributions from the eight founders, but chromosome X had significantly lower allelic contributions from the two inbred founders with underrepresented subspecific origins (PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ). By comparing extinct CC lines to living CC strains, we conclude that a complex genetic architecture is driving extinction, and selection pressures are different on the autosomes and chromosome X. Male infertility played a large role in extinction as 47% of extinct lines had males that were infertile. Males from extinct lines had high variability in reproductive organ size, low sperm counts, low sperm motility, and a high rate of vacuolization of seminiferous tubules. We performed QTL mapping and identified nine genomic regions associated with male fertility and reproductive phenotypes. Many of the allelic effects in the QTL were driven by the two founders with underrepresented subspecific origins, including a QTL on chromosome X for infertility that was driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype. We also performed the first example of cross validation using complementary CC resources to verify the effect of sperm curvilinear velocity from the PWK/PhJ haplotype on chromosome 2 in an independent population across multiple generations. While selection typically constrains the examination of reproductive traits toward the more fertile alleles, the CC extinct lines provided a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of fertility in a widely genetically variable population. We hypothesize that incompatibilities between alleles with different subspecific origins is a key driver of infertility. These results help clarify the factors that drove strain extinction in the CC, reveal the genetic regions associated with poor fertility in the CC, and serve as a resource to further study mammalian infertility.",""

An easy and time-saving method is the preparation of ORS in milk. As milk-based ORS are hypertonic solutions administration of them may trigger thirst. Therefore, we hypothesized that restrictively fed calves receiving ORS prepared in milk had a higher water intake than restrictively and ad libitum fed calves receiving ORS prepared in water during diarrheic episodes. The daily water intake was measured in 100 individually-housed Holstein Friesian calves from day 2 to 21 of life. One group of the calves was fed with restrictive amounts of milk, the other group got milk ad libitum by an automated milk feeder. Nearly all calves spontaneously developed diarrhea within the observation period from day 2 to 21 of life. In cases of diarrhea the restrictively-fed calves received ORS prepared in milk or ORS prepared in water two hours after their milk meal, whereas the ad libitum-fed calves only got ORS prepared in water. All calves had ad libitum access to water. The daily intake of water, milk, and ORS and weight gain during diarrheic episode were determined. Data were expressed as arithmetic means (±standard deviation) and analyzed by using a one-way ANOVA or repeated-measures ANOVA. From day 2 to 21 of life calves fed with restrictive amounts of milk had higher water intakes related to the total dry matter intake (DMI) with 1.6L/kg of total DMI than ad libitum-fed calves (0.9L/kg of total DMI) per day. In cases of diarrhea water intake increased in all feeding groups. The calves receiving milk-based ORS had the highest water intake with 1.7L/d during the period of diarrhea compared to the calves received ORS prepared in water. Moreover, the calves fed ORS in milk showed with 4.6L/d the highest daily ORS intake. There were no differences in the duration of diarrhea or the daily weight gain during period of diarrhea between the feeding regimens. Therefore, it can be concluded that all feeding regimens were suitable in the treatment of calf diarrhea. The simplest method to treat calves suffering from diarrhea is the preparation of ORS in milk, but then ad libitum availability of water is absolutely necessary. Moreover, calves drink considerable amounts of water within the first 3 weeks of life and therefore should be provided with water for animal welfare reasons.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35f217b268a372a2fae9bbfd3b0fa875, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d976cac67d4ffaf12f55fd2752a14a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51dc07fabac5dc1c96e4a8f9bab20c7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58b4d61696aef6416250b0e64e579a80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a63e74f7b5057a00f753c81e8e9e7b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/718c5aac7dc22c743405c61d334946ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75c305a27d05cec4d99ea1444ae8482b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9062949b74204a25e33454e8f5ea7cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afd65ba8f5000cdf3fd573c5fca39b31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9ce504c1ccd984e57032261b0d3ad3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d83d164e8e6b8e9ec4e0bc7a3b131344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc026bb2b94f5da1c84e78c3adbfc9c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc1ab6b7141ccec876b38b4a75c7f01d"

It focuses on the mouse and descriptive morphology is used for considering both molecular mechanisms, underpinning kidney morphogenesis and differentiation, and the ways in which these processes can go awry and lead to congenital kidney disorders—particularly in humans. The mature kidney is a fairly complex organ attached to an arterial input vessel and two output vessels, the vein and the ureter. Inside, the artery and vein are connected by a complex network of capillaries that invade a large number of glomeruli, the proximal entrance to nephrons, which are filtration units that link to an arborized collecting-duct system that drains into the ureter. The ability of the kidney and isolated metanephrogenic mesenchyme, to develop in culture means that the developing tissues can be subjected to a wide variety of experimental procedures designed to investigate their molecular and cellular properties and to test hypotheses about developmental mechanisms.",""

As biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different–omic types (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules, incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/027283117dd617f51873d45762230158, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/202088daec1cf10666f5f37e56f9b174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/267f2a4fd6abc8c1888eeb1c23c845c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/278bd02656cb15ad9a4f26489ebfc662, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ecaac84f926db1b06eaf94f05c03ce9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50ebfa174f309ba931b5606e17c50729, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51d63bc95d112c66d800cc7411cb30fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d942d409c8f237b987ea30d9623cb49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b05080d0f26f2a3c3a459e60554ccd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/916fd296bd9649ee96214417955032b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98f5faff6870efc17fd46ef346197934, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ad4b566b692da8f55d3784ff822e85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0bb6000ae230d5d99b1259200aee245, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcceb1562f36cf0e09ddcf2c5c029e33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb5ea9b5725a20edf85ec4493da8dc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebc2cd53bf20eba0cf96899ab43aaf46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f482eb926cab5f97361d9e0d859218bc"

However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non–consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non–consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05cffa6cffd38e10ec5e9a67196bfb3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10c26281c43141967f1aa899b75bf6b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/124223a81af5a98692148b1a59fdd231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15d4ee86f344844fd95ce7e5019129e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/370fbd86a47eeec17ed8996c677f5798, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/435f96b435be109b83f1b24357505aca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4aff347bf55bbefef171db302a4c690f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f70f74d217a44f1063b3336dc1a7032, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/724e37d646bb6de3e2d65155fe5f53b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76321b262dd1f72cc2a035af4215bb19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7729091fc8cd531dea5b4f837cffa508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/778595f627de0fafd5e15e24bb34b795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82ed142c920e47d6b50f57c4b7b79121, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85a4c37cdb423dc5b15256a7755fa4f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/909754a13d706e12eea0745a743be1ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd6450ed1cda6c4bceda7223a372836, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a290a64030e756406c223018a518f624, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa3c605be10e7d858ea0db62ee7afedf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae03e7158c38b98c71271a1082ea054a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2bf3bdf6f1b47d5a770cd300a8048be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b96e0878e79e8e619c2259c9c8101e98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cadd9f22dee78f18285cffaad9aaa2c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc4ac3548edbf31de5ad27f1daec493e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc6ba1dc107507620d5f9b54956245d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dda8c313102bb4a504d71870882d7073, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d47991d4613dbe51db438e99136bae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4985245e6ae124d9f8953a788234eab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f526e68e2f635e39b7b656f372f57670, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f732477f96706946a7165da5ed4c2135, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f77bdcd7a41ba0467b40247b2da5612f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa229ac3a1471b3fb36b9e199b8f6955, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdbb78ee9502319d0d0738163a04cfe5"

Neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice provides a useful tool for studying mechanisms of demyelination in a virus-induced experimental model of MS. This study uses Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare differential spinal cord mRNA levels between mice infected with demyelinating and non-demyelinating strains of MHV to identify host immune genes expressed in this demyelinating disease model. The study reveals that during the acute stage of infection, both strains induce inflammatory innate immune response genes, whereas upregulation of several immunoglobulin genes during chronic stage infection is unique to infection with the demyelinating strain. Results suggest that the demyelinating strain induced an innate-immune response during acute infection that may promote switching of Ig isotype genes during chronic infection, potentially playing a role in antibody-mediated progressive demyelination even after viral clearance.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e7c2581e19fffb71698c1d711f19928, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/153dd62d974ecffe684942677a96c92c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15e377731aa1dbf6eb0f4d2a32724316, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/171cb2f1e2ac200dd99a6fbd6fde3aa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24b835185fb57a5563288e48ddcea098, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2742e83714a54045bc8a8edd5ba86956, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c6d1775282e6e85e094344635438445, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fa5e0d055d72efbeb8b55152d47ab40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/423e98b475651f0b84d4c086acadaa49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/561c08b70dc8f800e5f5a7f446060730, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c706d266c5f4efc761f03e8fa6278eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6537b650f6f0cabc484b06e854698009, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69f60cb84e390e09821a6c4bde984699, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/743566509b74ec845512162f7b69cc47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7467daa13d561a75dce8b6b52ba35741, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75fefa5cb6b5c3e98758b5c934ecdf53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7debfe6f567484c5912837a6377bf083, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83a772828e08ea7df07f8167278f35a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92111fe3c4efe7e468f2309350ef9961, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b972ef39643cb5b9b18fcda4b13ce79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8287ae2b05623e3c019982bba875891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca2d73c3aaa2f2ab28f3f9bf50868a33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc3b93b34a499be13f94debdd8c29965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d55caa668e10ff569374ae581889a1f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6dcf70cd5693acd8116a98fd5b12a42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcc17b0c171daf3a56262ed8b8e88a46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd6fc2ddfee2d645a2a01a0b0fdf0c80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df0420208fa756e90c59dcd9732983bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4c31f933b07202f3b553fad4d10d932, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6fd112bdf508450a73daa8814a00174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea99c0ecf3c88f89a072cebbe229d3c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee2a32ed4830a65e8a34cd190d295890"

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks. SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 1607 hospital HCWs aged ≥18 years working full-time in selected high-risk wards. INTERVENTION: Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection. RESULTS: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.

We have recently shown that soluble forms of the chicken and quail Tva receptor (sTva), expressed from genes delivered by retroviral vectors, block ALV(A) infection of cultured chicken cells (∼200-fold antiviral effect) and chickens (>98% of the birds were not infected). We hypothesized that inhibition of viral replication by sTva would select virus variants with mutations in the surface glycoprotein (SU) that altered the binding affinity of the subgroup A SU for the sTva protein and/or altered the normal receptor usage of the virus. Virus propagation in the presence of quail sTva-mIgG, the quail Tva extracellular region fused to the constant region of the mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) protein, identified viruses with three mutations in the subgroup A hr1 region of SU, E149K, Y142N, and Y142N/E149K. These mutations reduced the binding affinity of the subgroup A envelope glycoproteins for quail sTva-mIgG (32-, 324-, and 4,739-fold, respectively) but did not alter their binding affinity for chicken sTva-mIgG. The ALV(A) mutants efficiently infected cells expressing the chicken Tva receptor but were 2-fold (E149K), 10-fold (Y142N), and 600-fold (Y142N/E149K) less efficient at infecting cells expressing the quail Tva receptor. These mutations identify key determinants of the interaction between the ALV(A) glycoproteins and the Tva receptor. We also conclude from these results that, at least for the wild-type and variant ALV(A)s tested, the receptor binding affinity was directly related to infection efficiency.",""

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors—which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines—induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ac636b678656979458a5a263aacd606, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10982e3d91ccd8206b72ea74bd4a59ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a113aad9a2c4f3e9a6392969b67540c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27542bfc4bb2dcef178959a76b7506a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30d32a7f4f759e5afa89d75713246b5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3244ef80417e45802170eec3dd2be1c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d0fcfaac2d36fad87d29074dfda78db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41d1e7bbdf777269ac585aadea51691d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b8e3eb7d4bd4c8d270dc2f5c0f47977, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54a38118ca51805e6023f46e43d54529, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55730f21138565351c3f8731220ec53c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d67c16c6ddbac3ccdd9f58f7b727a85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f07c46d0d43737ad05e9aeb48fe1c0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/619eee73f8d01d55d9dd872967602baf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/710f71adb8976ec086d9e9f64740e07b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/774b74d687105d169e86f4677a324600, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82900c4953442eea76e355ca29527409, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8486b3a821a3f78ab97ed79c698d23a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85c1ab70d0f102503715159b435cee63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86af9dca0eca6d4bc5ff960fe7a3da2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89fe765279fde43436330641314ab831, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a310a47dae3538958748527d2be3ba20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9118547fc8282e76f089cbee4ea25c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac1e7d74714ea0874423b743f9d864ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac35ca85c78f402fe8a6ff056811192a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3dca93061ae52e4607e743715da18dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba986a4c8bdc9a4f95d9469fdc5d71d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bad9f0c73c2f355cefa3ec1db1ee4756, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0bd7f9889fb9ba34fa4eb79947d1539, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c63cd07c3c8cb8742eec5502cf6b4b6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c938c08bf08573c434798d8cedc000c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc1cf9f37803639e0f10c9b4ea9f5623, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d47a7756251106c8940c539a100aa7bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d571bfe5eeede0aa3d3293d1c897c714, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7bd85461c3496f8a8eaccb94846d08d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d99015630ef9d41313f0d6f1baf44281, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4fb3c4d8a9ab0d7c25b6debd8c5c595, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f129b88ad0b4be65da089d085af49480, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3503b3d58ead09dadd8777021d214de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f476c72ae94204be828794238b5c2a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc46f817ab2e276dbda1140ca3a006f2"

However, subunit vaccines have not been successfully commercialized mainly due to the lack of sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAs). High levels of NA rely on the efficient recognition and cross-linking of multiple neutralizing epitopes with B-cell receptors (BCRs). Nanoparticles are able to display coupled antigenic arrays at high density and provide multiple binding molecular scenarios with BCRs. The high-resolution antigenic structure makes it possible to accurately display stable neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, the development of a nanovaccine that orientationally displays neutralizing epitopes is a feasible strategy. To address this hypothesis, the capsid (Cap) protein of porcine circovirus type 2 as model antigen was conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through direct reaction of the mercapto group of the unique cysteines with AuNPs, rendering Cap-AuNPs to have neutralizing epitopes on outer surface and an immunodominant epitope buried within the inner surface. In vitro studies showed that AuNPs promoted the phagocytosis of Cap protein and NA levels were significantly improved, meanwhile antibody levels against the immunodominant epitope was significantly reduced. In mouse studies, Cap-AuNP-immunized mice displayed a high production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and interferon-γ, suggesting that Cap-AuNPs can effectively activate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and balance Th1 and Th2 cellular responses. This study presents a new vaccine design strategy based on antigen structure, where nanoparticles are coupled to antigens in well-ordered arrays and orientationally display neutralizing epitopes to enhance NA levels.",""

As MBL binds to carbohydrates, we hypothesized that N-linked glycans on the RRV envelope glycoproteins act as ligands for MBL. Using a panel of RRV mutants lacking the envelope N-linked glycans, we found that MBL deposition onto infected cells was dependent on the E2 glycans. Moreover, the glycan-deficient viruses exhibited reduced disease and tissue damage in a mouse model of RRV-induced myositis compared to wild-type RRV, despite similar viral load and inflammatory infiltrates within the skeletal muscle. Instead, the reduced disease induced by glycan-deficient viruses was linked to decreased MBL deposition and complement activation within inflamed tissues. These results demonstrate that the viral N-linked glycans promote MBL deposition and complement activation onto RRV-infected cells, contributing to the development of RRV-induced myositis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/118f29a3a0a8f4ee50198f5e8f86644a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28ab9a94dbfeda67b548fd1dfee4609b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ba1456a2e11c82a46a089b328a14671, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fec525ce7947e01ef3fb2fb949810d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3230642406aa06d913cdd1a524844450, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32a1977df8dcafd15a811f0cc2090ee8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/338d8a65aae8f825d46f3175afef8276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3aaaa4b1475a2973526419d66f50ee85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b78cb42881772d4ed9fd0db8cace0e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fa1ca9034e03da2a7bbde7fac01324c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d41dc41e7477dc68757225452fc3e5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ee94062bb26faa6257c08a977c67d2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f2eef1cdbd629a2b44cea8a8c3c68e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6410aee087757c3f82cc531d72091bc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a0d501309c263c6b96c6b92fce4db62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75c5ed649eb9183c8120a4ccc3116734, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/774b22e66b0ed252f3f9669ea39c06f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fc49a1b9b03c06fb3d08a967e3a4098, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/881acf5310c9ec14b345a5d2410c57d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b0041be2cd24b7c0966553fae06c21a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ef981266996424e80a848b047ec8157, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9918430b7decf6eea390774eea1206a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a0bc5c59ea3144364692371edb27473, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b6338ae42ccec522fa8379cf9dd2ab7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c81afb12d144b55e40fe75dea76efaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d9b73fd504bea17132c56e02612864f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e4ce580b6173c245dec0bace25133a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2c3c7f822d2b2f644c5b2bac7c4198a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3eb8dbb57b53c31a27af8893cb4f1c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c561a08fae773632ac1160aa8b41ccc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7cc7aeac5610d9150e14a5e6dceecd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbd971ddd742b1d9b70384a9835c380d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d34d98afc694e6074118353f17f0326b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d49007a42ec1b1544e0ec01b781437fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4c729139a4b7e507815b6d20009765d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8aecda12581c34a9ad4b57c729ca062, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e51ff7c545584726fdad04029a765a0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b2c82b9756a3b20cdd60fbdcebefe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebaf53ffa7efd3c9d8d0258ad0729198, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f41a3b3823059e52e2cd62d74ee778fa"

While it is generalized that 3CLpro and the structurally related 3Cpro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (CLSPs), some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized. Here, we present three crystal structures of SARS 3CLpro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide-based phthalhydrazide inhibitors. Both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of Cys145, trapping the enzyme's catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates. Most significantly, our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule, possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr26, has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme-bound inhibitor. Our data suggest that this structure resembles that of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptidyl cleavage.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08fd459e4d83d9a927c9c4d9fda7ed62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0952e310cfc0c0efad9a4bbd22a6e5dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e2bda9ef753f1c21bfcae77f18ac2c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28e398f8abaaa0bec874dbfdaf4dd485, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3316fe3b24d59ab33fde62720cfd6d63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3354744eb781aa4ba96bb9b670d4da48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36ccf1548b4b52b0e2f3afecf1f9169f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3810ca0f25c5f9b9cdd1aef7e1b483d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f23fbad806c5f300fcec600e69cc692, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49ce9b5698e5d7fdc63284f39a21722c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4acc622ccd40a70046daad04ec52909e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57604597612f9bf2e1812bfd3f7d7d1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6067756a12718c5504a6092f0012f28b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61093d66f4d0aa15873a2c2267db5d16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65dc0fc6a3ac1fdfd0c7464ba964ffb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f1dedc0a19391f4a6b42cfc0a0d078d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/711d1519c4ad0961f44c0c1cfc1c16eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76ed14d1ca91f039d8ea748f2fae29e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84feac973cd385bdfa571c85545ab7e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88e1e92aae1f52158cd71b02df300c3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/897d4d490f38ceb3714eee44603a6722, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89e57cbd305adc92b4f86e61e314bb20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e53497df26a1291d7a66ac1b998b8c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/948a249381867e0e149c2cd018cc37ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b5b4f13b9bfc6556abe296d2f9f7e16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad28f1ff1311fa46c1fa9aff70f56c6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4f1134fb9585d87d2d657bc2f91dc0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5a188e81f9b0dbfb339fe010945816e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6c3c7a5c05336ace7f723760c9b4fa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d49cf2503aad27a96f376f69a93b9080, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8b16f2493f3b8bf7ce7be833285bf45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db8688e30396fd68d2b880d99a9f0428, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f45940348b539154c660fbb51261ac04"

Since the spread of an infectious disease is related to the intensity of contacts between individuals, fragmentation destabilizes the way the parasites circulate in their host population. Recently, Zinkernagel has proposed that a reduction in the frequency of infections by a parasite could lead to the emergence of severe forms of the disease, previously avoided because the disease was contracted early in life and attenuated by maternal antibodies. However, it is still unclear whether this change in disease expression increases the global mortality it induces because the disease becomes more severe and also less frequent. Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel. Firstly, we show that there is a change in the severity of the disease during the fragmentation process, especially at a local scale, suggesting that host population fragmentation could be a widespread mechanism of disease emergence. Secondly, we show that the emergence of the severe form of the disease can lead to a significant increase in its induced mortality. Finally, we determine the types of interactions for which the fragmentation of the host population could be the most dangerous.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fe380ee3c9591c32017c669e30b1af4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f7bcf95067cff8a2b8477dde83da36c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a2aac60d94963456ff8c648f5def423, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ea710a96f92060234c3d2d8767a2638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f022b7aeebd6ed28129dbe4e7fe050b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0570ee7d156279675e29d079f5d05c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7cd95972ac74d5e48af1a9276e86213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abe2c67fc5de63023b169c77365bed1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3d563241cb4801bff925870f0e08aeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9b8682b5580f3dcd897904733af5f30"

In this study, high titered mouse antisera against the N-terminal globular (S1) and S2 subunits of the S protein were generated and total immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from these antisera. The efficiency of these purified IgGs in virus neutralization and blocking of receptor binding were compared quantitatively using virus neutralization assay and a previously developed cell-based receptor binding assay, respectively. We demonstrated that anti-S1 IgG neutralizes the virus and binds to the membrane associated S protein more efficiently than anti-S2 IgG does. Moreover, both anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-S1 IgG showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency. The unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG towards the receptor binding implied a possible role of the S2 subunit in virus docking process and argues against the current hypothesis of viral entry. On the other hand, the functional roles of the previously reported neutralizing epitopes within S2 subunit were investigated using an antigen specific antibody depletion assay. Depletion of antibodies against these regions significantly diminished, though not completely abolished, the neutralizing effects of anti-S2 IgG. It suggests the absence of a major neutralizing domain on S2 protein. The possible ways of anti-S2 IgGs to abolish the receptor binding and the factors restricting anti-S2 IgGs to neutralize the virus are discussed.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0089517d1ab52b905a5da276eac8044f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1597d48d1b24af920514fd55d3e78e89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a4c275ede840012efa4b5db81bcc84b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33fa8df9f277d74083ae02aee3d32392, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/357f924cdbb9056297d61175604ed496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/382e6ae3aa037e25fa62daab317cfca7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bbba1f6bb4b044fc351a1bc02cdd674, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b99e53a6af5ead3a0f6eb3535037085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/575a2027a0b26184e24fe5ea1544e912, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58af2fca462c31435698d3f129d7dee8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63532c02dcdc72c68778266f677844e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64524aacc850d850a30846ccbb27ec4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65cf54f9d303a7e9ad9eeb480ac5f926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/695d48c100a3974ef12ff77cf233d6a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69ac95743599b710ab444e8af7c6acf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72109fd899b22fe555db6d7bb9c97041, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75319ad5e6de78f2c1699b288cac2169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78ed2082fcc4f124e329a97622bcc4fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81b2649aaf051e94964ae354bf26474f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8efe9e2b1c04f94214955f0c62e39104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95eaeeb9035bbe5321b60b6e3103e5e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b3b51b9378c5a3a312d5da30afbf195, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dd1e6293700974faad5003deacd84e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9b5ec3dade0dccf9a61486c38cf463e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab0f5822855dd9e93efe1d2378abe774, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0253b5a2f748a999e9d76222f81d44b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c63ef5eb067636498acfe0fc5f17cc7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb1f3d4722758751a6f1fdb3fd462cd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb89e9d3afd6a11db73aa88ce4ec8f18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7f54675afb3042de424360bb50a1300, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0fc5ec239d3e2909d66d16759227ee2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5d83441a84cba15af8075746bb92e10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1ab1d970d90a38e3b4437f74b4d5694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f428717a27137dd9c8a0ada771854d04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f784cd65ba96b40066eb09db666a78bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7c20f37b16aff9eb94f055e4652a0f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa128b2f516edc62321a8c75ae5af06a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe675a5d19b755df78a283c8730d2fed"

We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens. Dysfunctional membrane peptidases and autoantibody production may result in neuroimmune dysregulation and autoimmunity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/022345d2f1c40d91d0edd974ebd3806d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/084a7bb83f29ca585fced47e316b4b8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b389d756e9262204c777c3155dfd310, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/105fa31d0b9bfe829d169ab6bdc075ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1710624ff600b049cff2fa582f3a2b80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c584d43aa7abf713db0eeec94fa7655, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/216327f5f879fb298d2249cfa1282dc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21f918fd339fffe408f3ced87f6b7ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ec16a64e9447befeb32de4596490ab2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3455e776d51e1338069c215e8f6b035d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c9987c779a790a074a395686f163c75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d0ab354176e08259387ef8c77d2d83e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d7c75c2f506aab71a48eef96b68bd2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52aed819281ab02047986b12a46f5837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/536cbe2e674637dbe7b3615cc6f8ac90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56fe5f11048aed2bb63992444dd6fcfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58358ccb7b8352641d40d7fbc3a983e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5858f89ff2dd851f0f0ae14e361fb398, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f0a7878ab8864a35fb6805e5304ee8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6130bffeb2add8f68eb2212639cf8635, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ab37013754b65373df5b60e2929e89b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84d00cdb3edc41171612ea4c9e95d65c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8838df596dcd14400bb0a2c8b17f51fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e13f2002f04c0c1106eabc19fc5c219, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/906536b513859c09027d8eaa963ad54a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94773e0b7ca9eedb21890236cfcb4d60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/953c55ab6829a5b71843becedbcc6e80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97310b33bbe65d50121bbb720e111cc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97991dfcb3aba7f9697f06c3039548d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c0989c0ba9c5f5c9686b6ef622d15f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a15161299181608f9c1f33df6e0e5869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a22c912592f9ff8cfab0160e0bd2d7e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a961c6e1aceec040633f1c85a4d5db8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad143ddf37f4953f9a5ba5ea9a23d327, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad5fcef27db5e03ea7986a4d4c32c4d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af69a738e78a652c1a4c7f7e71f133e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b21817c927d2b08d65f377f88e7f988c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b55238bc773c7c38adf6138d50bab13f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be01d0d0c45c74c5bd64748657d7bcd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf1630991ed0fd40f13a01e163f6b67a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d1540c713221c4e0ec8853cea9287d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c251a9e6b77c62a3b7b9e6c80d1bacfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5e76444b2a30f1669f6c8cd410ed9ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da5684416548767bb30f9e5907a15409, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcf0980d1274ef45629e5ad5499c6f3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3b6f5a9d209f9bd2b714875288e1694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f43b1245b9f61baa640f2f6ca50a62c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f98b2aeed9341f93e14453fb84503a71"

Several recent studies hypothesized that bats, an ancient group of flying mammals, are the major reservoir of several important RNA virus families from which other mammalian viruses of livestock and humans were derived. Although this hypothesis needs further investigation, the premise that bats carry a large number of viruses is commonly accepted. The question of whether bats have unique biological features making them ideal reservoir hosts has been the subject of several recent reviews. In this review, we will focus on the public health implications of bat derived zoonotic viral disease outbreaks, examine the drivers and risk factors of past disease outbreaks and outline research directions for better control of future disease events.",""

Use of polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the FBoV-1 DNA in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous viremia, with the viral nucleic acid, detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), was localized in intestinal cells and vascular endothelium of intestinal mucosa and serosa, and in necrosis areas primarily in various lymph nodes while FPLV-immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral localization only in cryptal cells, neurons, and limited to leukocytes in the mesenteric lymph node. Full-length coding genome analysis of the Thai FBoV-1 strains isolated from moribund cats revealed three distinct strains with a high between-strain genetic diversity, while genetic recombination in one of the three FBoV-1 strains within the NS1 gene. This is the first report identifying natural genetic recombination of the FBoV-1 and describing the pathology and viral tropism of FBoV-1 infection in cats. Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic infection of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric infection of FBoV-1 is possible. Synergistic effects of dual infection with FPLV and FBoV-1 are hypothesized, suggesting more likely severe clinical presentations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/006096dc64378a57c3b1fe62d1f64945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f64f9600867f079eaa318fa4f1cf2d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/130f6ecf2031ecbae1fc2d07bec6c499, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/197e93023c8dc9f0aaf95d294b484b9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b9a798dd2a97733dd7c6befb5f965b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/205fe4890ed9bbf41346043af54b952f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28065963f8ee5349a1b77c0411a00142, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d557eb1d838c6ff46a5e9f5225f6e72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d6c2bceb611eff3345d9153e82745f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49370cd5f51f36a2632e1f3ef77e3bc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/494f2fea8998767e184aa96c2d380835, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ddf3210a329204f56dcf571f13c01b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e711b0ada60968dbb2953620795bfb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c51263a2c42b758674b6f8c478f0c48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e92844500f08b2c13895f7502c7928d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/722c9cd7eee3d61aec699832ba50a317, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f785cea299cbd169e77d566e186fabf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/802555de3dd8b22aee095a64ea28bfba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86428be1b5a1ca4681aaaa7ac14d4295, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86eb57694b91528d7cc28f3d22e97cd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac2c5677c4d2ed449a477e0ccf78925b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad6a1cd6ea042688cb7a9a7c1d2dcce2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adfee5dee93d7ccbd7d2c7c48546768c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b666b635f02b3d773f92b7d2e5fc08e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7fdcb3231fac68accd3017560132eb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc242f53c35ef513347cafda15b173ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0c89ed8b755a7dbaa5f57c4c5ce39db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcebc1f134948061f34dab0a759d253d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd50a38ffddd6fabf83cfe92cacb1481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1c8d5544d624c9bfed576a9a1896222, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea2d13ac16c862b423988ff8b56d3ca2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea9f5151542982969f19ae3d5664fbc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8218225c0732eb7f2ddc16f825e4092"

The program includes seven Proteomics Research Centers, generating diverse types of pathogen-host data, including mass spectrometry, microarray transcriptional profiles, protein interactions, protein structures and biological reagents. The Biodefense Resource Center (www.proteomicsresource.org) has developed a bioinformatics framework, employing a protein-centric approach to integrate and support mining and analysis of the large and heterogeneous data. Underlying this approach is a data warehouse with comprehensive protein + gene identifier and name mappings and annotations extracted from over 100 molecular databases. Value-added annotations are provided for key proteins from experimental findings using controlled vocabulary. The availability of pathogen and host omics data in an integrated framework allows global analysis of the data and comparisons across different experiments and organisms, as illustrated in several case studies presented here. (1) The identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and human HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium) and viral (orthopox) pathogens suggesting that this protein can be prioritized for additional analysis and functional characterization. (2) The analysis of a vaccinia-human protein interaction network supplemented with protein accumulation levels led to the identification of human Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 protein as a potential therapeutic target. (3) Comparison of complete genomes from pathogenic variants coupled with experimental information on complete proteomes allowed the identification and prioritization of ten potential diagnostic targets from Bacillus anthracis. The integrative analysis across data sets from multiple centers can reveal potential functional significance and hidden relationships between pathogen and host proteins, thereby providing a systems approach to basic understanding of pathogenicity and target identification.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003487c0c66e55236cf2b8012c226deb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01c27c27de2c58fcca45621266cf71cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03c4c91b6c72756680de2da074a51d18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04dc887e0dec516135e112865b3d55f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04f0e991ef6ceeb7ad97f14b541186ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0504b9c40792d9e53e36d797c48bfd62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09bfbe8b10bc6eff02d05d3bd83064ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bed3bf8dd6dde26516c844655655662, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10e760834fc3d77c5cf5872de1dbb7b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13c6f2fc9003da5081729f8861e97cc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c3dc9921aa911783ede42e6144d65ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f79aead8667b1c379a99cc1c201c455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20ad7651572ecf0822be513482cec2cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25f4fd7b294b5d5124b75b9d05b5f694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28e2ad108c22c9572f38d07e3a4f32e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2adeffab545be6fdda48aabb48a8b68b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aea0a3286ea0d3f7cde7f5d94ca16c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c1f2c211bec26c6e53724ebade63481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/328e12f019a4d619f57118055039ec1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/346f4ccecc7ef1a6ec4b6780d1d23560, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/420066293dff5c15f59dd781bddfc4ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4308b7c5a8fa8db1c92e5142058ac131, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4758aad5cf22d6f9f55596f9cead4a4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4df2c0326392d87670399927e38bd231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f9e47105fff87c8d8985919838e77c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bda0bd4f06c28a4426fc604119439c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61778e3588d686590aa859e630a09718, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688121135f5c26add10fdd888f62e597, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/759b33f29c2e616e953937fd6998eca7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75be781fd4827b39d728d0e5997c7da4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7962885f173989ed62cb7b0ba47694c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9822ae052064d6b56053d7475d25e0ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c1516e20701147f315695b8aa66e85a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9e4e112bd3acfb544318493c8b080ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b207013fc93ca9c7cbd63ac215bdb8c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bebd465528ed9d8f43b1926fbfdcd34d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf6704ade61e60a6db98804aa4fdc1e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0d74f8c7757f0adbdba6f1b96c6d532, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c23b12997b0fdddaf64be9166ccc7844, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7f2c9201f83fc2ef14f4832fb44ade0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce7f2f068cd65f26e5318afec3f56a05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d109cd6250db328c7f9b5fde49d76f04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e280c9f92c39b01a291d8365d92aeb5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea6bbbd01a56b806f84098306f761608, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5baf5f0176e4eeb9dd297d2dbf326be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f72f096a60c9a637f2146e17abc40486"

Previously, we showed that, in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, rhinovirus (RV) infection increases type 2 cytokine production from alternatively-activated (M2) airway macrophages, enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. METHODS: Eight week-old wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. RESULTS: In contrast to OVA-treated wild-type mice with both neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation, OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed increased neutrophilic inflammation with few eosinophils in the airways. Like wild-type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV. There was a shift in lung cytokines from a type 2-predominant response to a type 1 response, including production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α. IL-17A was also increased. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice further increased neutrophilic inflammation. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed an M1 polarization pattern and ex vivo RV infection increased macrophage production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12p40. Finally, lung cells from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed reduced CD206+ CD301+ M2 macrophages, decreased IL-13 and increased TNF-α and IL-17A production by F4/80+, CD11b+ macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection of OVA-treated mice increased type 1 cytokine and IL-17A production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. In mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4R signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/001cf27b472e01022fa202d8245e8543, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0334b16de82dd50ebbaf976e8fdcc2be,

The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity. We selected the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for analysis because of its well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification during the late stage of autophagic flux. We documented that bafilomycin treatment from 48 to 72 h postinfection lowered VZV titers substantially (P ≤ 0.008). Because we were unable to define the site of the block in the infectious cycle by confocal microscopy, we turned to electron microscopy. Capsids were observed in the nucleus, in the perinuclear space, and in the cytoplasm adjacent to Golgi apparatus vesicles. Many of the capsids had an aberrant appearance, as has been observed previously in infections not treated with bafilomycin. In contrast to prior untreated infections, however, secondary envelopment of capsids was not seen in the trans-Golgi network, nor were prototypical enveloped particles with capsids (virions) seen in cytoplasmic vesicles after bafilomycin treatment. Instead, multiple particles with varying diameters without capsids (light particles) were seen in large virus assembly compartments near the disorganized Golgi apparatus. Bafilomycin treatment also led to increased numbers of multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm, some of which contained remnants of the Golgi apparatus. In summary, we have defined a previously unrecognized property of bafilomycin whereby it disrupted the site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids by altering the pH of the trans-Golgi network and thereby preventing the correct formation of virus assembly compartments. IMPORTANCE This study of VZV assembly in the presence of bafilomycin A1 emphasizes the importance of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network as a platform in the alphaherpesvirus life cycle. We have previously shown that VZV induces levels of autophagy far above the basal levels of autophagy in human skin, a major site of VZV assembly. The current study documented that bafilomycin treatment led to impaired assembly of VZV capsids after primary envelopment/de-envelopment but before secondary reenvelopment. This VZV study also complemented prior herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus studies investigating two other inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus function: brefeldin A and monensin. Studies with porcine herpesvirus demonstrated that primary enveloped particles accumulated in the perinuclear space in the presence of brefeldin A, while studies with herpes simplex virus 1 documented an impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles in the presence of monensin.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03511d83c51b3f37ce66d1b36995cf5e,

This study tested the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and illness severity. Methods Two groups of 97 specimens each were randomly selected from multiplex-PCR identified virus-positive and virus-negative nasal specimens obtained from adults with new onset ARI, and 40 control specimens were collected from healthy adults. All specimens were analyzed for Haemophilus influenzae(HI), Moraxella catarrhalis(MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae(SP) by quantitative-PCR. General linear models tested for relationships between respiratory pathogens, biomarkers (nasal wash neutrophils and CXCL8), and ARI-severity. Results Nasal specimens from adults with ARIs were more likely to contain bacteria (37% overall; HI = 28%, MC = 14%, SP = 7%) compared to specimens from healthy adults (5% overall; HI = 0%, MC = 2.5%, SP = 2.5%; p < 0.001). Among ARI specimens, bacteria were more likely to be detected among virus-negative specimens compared to virus-positive specimens (46% vs. 27%; p = 0.0046). The presence of bacteria was significantly associated with increased CXCL8 and neutrophils, but not increased symptoms. Conclusion Pathogenic bacteria were more often detected in virus-negative ARI, and also associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers. These findings suggest the possibility that bacteria may augment virus-induced ARI and contribute to airway inflammation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07d5e2fcbeb7e20d56437c7cffe9b743, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08ac84d4cc36e36d66591cebad30f866, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0985d91d1e4026fb0c5804a5d6ab6bba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b6bfc2033d71eb91e2359332b032656, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b8556d724261b03788cad5e4a7bfe25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dc796e46be841b0fc30116e7086217f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/121ffc9ec7ddc5f7e39a19b179f57650, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/131d16c6b247da2e80182497a3a71719, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17b21dd5a95909a1299c10504ad01873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/223fd9c7d4914185abc318637f828eb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b295a1206b55bd6bf68c75a02ba840e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b796b81d96d95f88709b6ea6639c8b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3675e5e8a524a5afbd07ed3bfb4eb8c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37f2499b68d4501befd4a5d792c98f28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a1f3521c89abc4b17eac8b3b4d5cf3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a209c7684706b92403ed55609a46bd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3da616610b4f281874b5bc25e46852ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f2e67fdade6c94b276e5eb2d919bd39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67cb60a223ff95ddad084775de165d8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c8b5690b5805cb044fa7101d9c5efc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79360dc0762f3512261110182bdbc75f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cb2537c8eebfa678284dba9d91db496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d06bc299aed205a922b2162291e3977, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ded922c63e0b2a043cf1e940c9ea9d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0146a58837613f3d061de1b98638a72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0cb6be3afcd5585a386597a77a2996c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6e27050678cea46fa3a7b3ee67f985f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1a989652ab0a5895f6c7127296242e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1fc99398b08d9259ea85cecea6c0579, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7238ae4cf46a189a3ea03eb118268bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db42b8e46536b0efe2cf23f3e378c679, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/deea9c18f89248c6d71542eb6f26c230, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e98ae19c5ded65f888f49bf60d8d4f10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eee376c0e23baf1477a3be3fa1c58386, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f00b212d6bd86396102c4ac2b6b7e53c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6735c7ba6a50ddceb6fece8e17c2f18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6837ff76d49042181f230ed6bc09047, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7e8901ce4c77ada453ae3f1fbd60a95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb7d9f7d5f18837a3acddda03bb4b022, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe9edb06731c7f27542e063c575d8291"

We hypothesized that genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with a response to asthma therapy during an asthma exacerbation were also associated with severity of acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 5 common polymorphisms in the promoter region and coding block of the ADRB2 gene (loci -2387, -2274, -1343, +46, and +79) from 374 Caucasian and African American term infants who were enrolled at the time of acute respiratory illness over four respiratory viral seasons. Severity of respiratory tract infections was measured using a bronchiolitis severity score (BSS; range = 0-12, clinically significant difference = 0.5) with a higher score indicating more severe disease. We assigned the promoter, coding and combined promoter and coding haplotypes to the unphased genotype data. The associations between each of these five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as the haplotypes and infant BSS were analyzed using nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable proportional odds model separately in Caucasians and African Americans. RESULTS: There was no significant association between infant BSS and each of the SNPs in both Caucasians and African Americans. However, promoter haplotype CCA was associated with a decreased BSS in African Americans in a dose dependent manner. The median (interquartile range) BSS of infants with no copies of the CCA haplotype, one copy, and two copies of the CCA haplotype were 5.5 (2.0, 8.0), 4.0 (1.0, 7.5), and 3.0 (1.0, 4.0), respectively. This dose dependent relationship persisted after adjusting for infant age, gender, daycare exposure, secondhand smoke exposure, prior history of breastfeeding, siblings at home, and enrollment season (adjusted odds ratio: 0.59, 95 % confidence interval: 0.36, 0.98). There was no similar protective relationship of haplotype CCA on severity of respiratory tract infections identified in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: ADRB2 genotype may be predictive of severity of acute respiratory tract infections in African Americans, and potentially identify a subset of infants who may respond to beta-agonist therapy.

The effects are surprisingly fast and specific. The present review explores our current knowledge about the routes of access to the cranial cavity. ‘Direct-access-pathways’ from the nasal cavity have been described but many additional experiments are needed to answer a variety of open questions regarding anatomy and physiology. Among the IN-applied substances oxytocin (OT) has an extensive history. Originally applied in women for its physiological effects related to lactation and parturition, over the last decade most studies focused on their behavioral ‘prosocial’ effects: from social relations and ‘trust’ to treatment of ‘autism’. Only very recently in a microdialysis study in rats and mice, the ‘direct-nose-brain-pathways’ of IN-OT have been investigated directly, implying that we are strongly dependent on results obtained from other IN-applied substances. Especially the possibility that IN-OT activates the ‘intrinsic’ OT-system in the hypothalamus as well needs further clarification. We conclude that IN-OT administration may be a promising approach to influence human communication but that the existing lack of information about the neural and physiological mechanisms involved is a serious problem for the proper understanding and interpretation of the observed effects.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1796d5660be45512dd83e49932e458f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/545f752912cfa05433c4127b41502136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f043e81acd1edb878b786c7e400b276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89adabcfbd3d7849cfd78b1bb7326e63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95cec8f31cbf3c7c5e108ab39ad6da10"

The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that the Type A trichothecene T-2 toxin interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to enteric reovirus infection. Mice were exposed i.p. first to 1.75 mg/kg bw T-2 and then 2 h later with 3 × 107 plaque-forming units of reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L). As compared to vehicle-treated control, T-2-treated mice had dramatically elevated intestinal plaque-forming viral titers after 5 days and failed to completely clear the virus from intestine by 10 days. Levels of reovirus λ2 core spike (L2 gene) RNA in feces in T-2-treated mice were significantly higher at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days than controls. T-2 potentiated L2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with as little as 50 μg/kg of the toxin having a potentiative effect. T-2 exposure transiently suppressed induction of reovirus-specific IgA in feces (6 and 8 days) as well as specific IgA and IgG2a in serum (5 days). This suppression corresponded to decreased secretion of reovirus-specific IgA and IgG2a in Peyer's patch (PP) and lamina propria fragment cultures prepared 5 days after infection. T-2 suppressed IFN-γ responses in PP to reovirus at 3 and 7 days as compared to infected controls whereas IL-2 mRNA concentrations were unaffected. PP IL-6 mRNA levels were increased 2-fold 2 h after T-2 treatment, but no differences between infected T-2-exposed and infected vehicle-treated mice were detectable over the next 7 days. Overall, the results suggest that T-2 toxin increased both the extent of GI tract reovirus infection and fecal shedding which corresponded to both suppressed immunoglobulin and IFN-γ responses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/098bc6ef13d20d3b3e3283d85c7e5d9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e326d125ad69307a11a793c0aed5e60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11f155f7c84a906a3d0b53ac7ba21f67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1426df7182b19aa90d92a09e66cb4a39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15c511b081b3d6dc89a4b4cb9db446e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/188828b23ca1c239361e6f3a33962b9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d8cdad30339bef752998fcac687d09f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1faf538bb29e69c542a014c39a2ca7e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20aa190831ec607bf5671470ea797e06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3192ec0d29a15b9527a5aa5345c7d846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/385508ec52df08ff8e33fa08bdd06454, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38bad1b4264dd54be57a1fb2b34e4714, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3aaf398a9ad4772f93b6f1442c9008d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b416a92c3e4afa73320ec189ddb7935, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b5f4951edd6b8004141465e8ff23f3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e66d742b3cde3492c6586cdbfa12ccb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fab04020c676d424a440be90adc9a75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b700f30ef26bab84a114cceda73122d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51adb610ddd47312aecdbb3b82ddbf12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51b124023aa7ae439dcb9c6a99ec514b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f4d60df32604f42ff6fd9baaa57201b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62c8a8dab5f7abc026346d5e8cc9ab1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62ef63cd4eb13fcac2539b58250ce8cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6db7e51349c62427e299f65057a91a28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7db5e5e04c70e3e5ee4375434703fc20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c9f94e2a69e7aac9be0972ba8246fd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98c2dea66c27499f508c5e406db39cc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b420df7844dd95cf300ab645a2c79df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c33de6a1d73451a1472ae31a66104b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a533bfb324b4a79464c6f3e67ffeaf91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aba345e741f4313ac0dcb32e18ccf04b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad01d2f00f28535b35ed7e7d07ca4d2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b844e1a48048c19bf8155dfd0672351e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c857e843ca99c831e51f80ca0d399876, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1fcccd07fd99fe78a6f5a909bb31d75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2df2f532fd80554fc12fc50f698eb75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9b5862dcd799c4d1b1b5e8a3d2ab621, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1382d0d20bb7e198d57c7707839a9ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e20c11b851c6d0834db5a04c5b63f0c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4f2bdc9984e428f5d4b61b76efb4125, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea1e33784aa9ae10e5d1082de87704be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec9139c1ffa1924d8cdfe020f3f5feab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edb1aac3ac6ee78f113566514aacf4aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee5e405ad67950e3ae35096ffe44b344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f31ac45a89e69734dc54c024102da5a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7c0f22e8502ed293c3de1670030f1ea"

However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. Objectives The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. Study design Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children’s hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. Results Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. Conclusions Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06ec4cccbf599d1c8b33161ea5f6edd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/331e203915fc74d7e1c40b1d6c205db0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3366b150717b493e779f3ebfdddfed8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/340106f4992c06f0b8012fc458a0cc9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3950b4eb4ec3b426948a1f08e4655d5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bdc62e596bc7633b8538c952f5b77f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/449e4627c584f9defa5c05594d65b22b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fdea9a3e8695287695db9ed2e87870c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5252510963e2f3289391c15263b4a841, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56229cdaa72af214137b3f9618bdb453, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6509c37101b7bb46040864b0334ef726, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67562a04a334fd09b50b726fadcc9b49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68623d68d7bd5212b038df548be1595a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81552807966a73789ccdd31d3d06c0f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c9b703b0456fc09e0d65dd77c63b42b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91b180002fdebc49b71f8209a6679787, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b970fa5d540ac205886894e020bc856, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e74f9cd80310c00944fa924f37a269b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a133992d63b7e4fc7d399f7eb2255ba9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a31d092f4efdad9c3bb1c57122f143a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a749523460bff6f46a723507b472848a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aca7f379714f7f537270ea1a3c51894d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b57f912e80e4a42c485452f4a96b0b02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdb475b136c499ba24afe44e1a57edfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d150e20945df1c146a0c85b6c0375963, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5858d7af3fc04498dc961338bd5f5b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb8bc77770043a7546af5de9cc15b007, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebb7c557f641e2f9b5444f55d532d0a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecd195a0875c6210f078408f70b5203b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f27bcaadca2a2c776167e303cf95578e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc0ca1bd23029f6e4a8e2617c90d22e7"

In situ hybridization of glial cell cultures infected with MHV-A59 again showed enhanced MHC mRNA expression, both in infected and uninfected cells. These results extend our earlier finding that MHC surface antigens are enhanced on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes after MHV-A59 infection and suggest that this enhancement is a result of an increase in the steady-state level of MHC mRNA. We further demonstrate that increases in MHC mRNA occur in the murine central nervous system (CNS) following infection in vivo. Northern blot analysis of RNA from the brains of infected animals showed transient expression of both MHC class I and class II mRNA over the first 14 days of infection. Expression coincided with viral replication and clearance. In situ hybridization of brain sections from infected animals showed that class I and class II expression was widespread throughout all portions of the brain and in uninfected as well as infected cells. Viral RNA, in contrast, was observed in small foci of cells and mostly within the limbic system. Thus enhancement of MHC mRNA was not restricted either to areas of infection or inflammation. The spatial relationship between viral and MHC expression supports our hypothesis that a soluble mediator is involved in the mechanism of the increase in MHC levels. The fact that MHC induction occurs in vivo as well as in vitro suggests MHC may be important in the mechanism of MHV-induced disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/496b51438cefd4a249aecb248b15bc10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ae46e8bd014c72127bcde639ae522c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bd6e8af28869d21a3b124a48a510c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7749ecc05d8dea3336fab05b81a190df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af27bc34c52f8cc09cb18e213f3251b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6a0f22987e1e5863c6057864a8b1837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb665a5bdabeb8a41eb7cd2e742bebf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c90c6b35e042caac05f2ddbff9837100"

Greater than 92% homology was found among the six strains by pair-wise comparison at the nucleotide level. The genes encoded proteins of 451 to 455 residues and the deduced amino acid sequences were more than 91% homologous. A unique deletion of twelve nucleotides was found at the carboxy terminus of MHV-Y and a three nucleotide deletion was found in MHV-RI, which corresponded to the one previously reported in MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Two internal open reading frames were found within the coding region of the nucleoprotein, the smaller one was specific for the enterotropic strains. It could potentially encode a truncated version of the hypothetical protein described for MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Sequence relationship of the N gene showed no correlation with tissue tropism and no sequence or even single amino acid change unique to either tropism group was found. This indicates that the nucleoprotein of MHV probably has no part in the determination of the primary tissue tropism of an MHV strain.

Insider managerial shareholding (IMS) includes two different classes of owners: managers and directors (i.e., managers’ shareholding [MAS] plus directors’ shareholding [DIRS]). The indicators of financial performance under consideration are return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), stock return (SR), and Tobin's Q. In addition to analyzing total insider managerial ownership (IMS), the study splits IMS into two components (MAS and DIRS) and examines each of them, separately. Subsequently, panel regression tests examine the effects of IMS, MAS, and DIRS on financial performance of Taiwanese tourist hotels. Test results suggest that IMS explains ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q, but not SR. Further, compared to MAS, DIRS has a more significant impact on hotel performance. Specifically, an inverted U-shape represents the effects of IMS and DIRS on hotel performance (ROA, ROE and Tobin's Q), indicating that both IMS and DIRS have a significantly positive impact on hotel performance up to an optimal point (supporting the convergence-of-interests hypothesis). Further, when IMS and DIRS are greater than their corresponding optimal points, these two factors can significantly deteriorate hotel performance (supporting the entrenchment hypothesis).","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/177be42626dc798e3280a07d0b0d164a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/256e17bd03311c62dfe87c5618fbe789, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b2c0d19c2ac5bba67c5a589e8a10140, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ca9d29fc90e5a8773abb4758833b238, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f3419aac182384581bd6d3280100740, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/303cdaf1f805472922dcc48377dcfa9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/396d8eb38224190ca65ef4dae3e72892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a5f68e978fa4f6464fb154f3030dee9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bf8b482656406c3064f5681e1310ec3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c7595133fbd5556da9ee6c592a2ae0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51a3acd5618ead6c0cf612a2379e531f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55ba487644b529e3417701c1c3771802, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71e80385230a0e80876de1778b6015ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7efaf40c37f84c56810b952095b6125f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c3b116086f96a8a6983e426b90b8706, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2fbd999300009f650dea34beed11972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb56556f3775e866db23d942545a9a50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d331630b801aff1435dbecebc25f7a04"

To promote elderly people’s behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention, the aim of the current project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based low-administration-cost intervention building on a leading psychological theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). METHODS: The target group is Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or older who rarely or never adopt any preventive actions. This project will be conducted in three phases over 24 months. In phase 1, intervention program will be developed building on the HAPA theoretical framework which comprises both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors. In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation + behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable.

The environmental origin of MERS-CoV is as yet unknown; however, its genome sequence is closely related to those of two bat coronaviruses, named BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, which were derived from Chinese bat samples. A hallmark of highly pathogenic respiratory viruses is their ability to evade the innate immune response of the host. CoV accessory proteins, for example those from severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), have been shown to block innate antiviral signalling pathways. MERS-CoV, similar to SARS-CoV, has been shown to inhibit type I IFN induction in a variety of cell types in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that MERS-CoV and the phylogenetically related BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 may encode proteins with similar capabilities. In this study, we have demonstrated that the ORF4b-encoded accessory protein (p4b) of MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 may indeed facilitate innate immune evasion by inhibiting the type I IFN and NF-κB signalling pathways. We also analysed the subcellular localization of p4b from MERS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 and demonstrated that all are localized to the nucleus.",""

Identification of exact amino acid residues that are crucial for the interaction of S1 with ACE2 could provide working hypotheses for experimental studies and might be helpful for the development of antiviral inhibitor. In this paper, a molecular docking model of SARS-CoV S1 protein in complex with human ACE2 was constructed. The interacting residue pairs within this complex model and their contact types were also identified. Our model, supported by significant biochemical evidence, suggested receptor-binding residues were concentrated in two segments of S1 protein. In contrast, the interfacial residues in ACE2, though close to each other in tertiary structure, were found to be widely scattered in the primary sequence. In particular, the S1 residue ARG453 and ACE2 residue LYS341 might be the key residues in the complex formation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01d26945d8339485993a118caef89a79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/156f0535f14f840c189d40fa20d82061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c9789c839be4a2e5a178015bb39a20b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a98ac741405e33ad47c69f2a1ef983b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f46b0abd19c586473f07d016c4cca1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42d51f19c1270748dcb0ecf9d83fb0cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4582121aeb26645a0663cd5b6efb6d81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64e2578bd94550375f1ae62820999f54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6daf6075b94771f96c80423a0d871290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/737751b935d1e67aa64edf3e3a5098c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/784ca1f613bdc4c74d335851a5e77e1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f9bc12ad0360aa4f2fc8305be8eb8b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a01132dad4d7fc204d56664e9d626d6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab9e0508f3c32a933baf984ed87b037f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b039a5d0a9f4464f6edf96fbeb9cdfee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b18950b7e56b2ff7610834964cf663fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b245e20633befb0ff6d8356b233c2a1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2855b7375a0f7c727ae4afafaeffc8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f35b681be55bf65bf8b89287b0328df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3e25b6da1ed2867280133d03a32fcb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff46121612c0e68d244e9013254e6c9f"

In contrast, very little is known about the viral proteins. In the present report we have identified the membrane glycoprotein (M) of PEDV by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the cloned M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated, and migrates with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the M protein synthesized by recombinant baculoviruses migrates with a Mr of 23 k, that is, with identical mobility as the deglycosylated product of PEDV. Thus, it appears that M protein specified by the recombinant baculovirus is poorly, if at all, glycosylated. Using monoclonal antibodies and rabbit antipeptide sera specific for the N and C termini of the M protein, we were able to show that a 19 k band detected in PEDV-infected cells but not in virions represented a fragment of M from which the C terminus had been cleaved off. Finally, by electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, the relative orientation of M within the virion envelope was determined as NexoCcyt. In conclusion, all of these data strongly support the hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the group I coronaviruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/008e2039c8cd56a727bebdb6898a53e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d007c288311c5a829a3ba81ac2d5deb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f4d4fe19f30821383b09a3114fd1fe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1188b4a3c5196bd98ef950e0cb5b4335, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/149a8c9abfc50458849243b76f1e0a1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2483a2dabdde6f1095dc89abae486273, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/254b0e388f76ad037ea43f0c077c9d47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2862739ba569ab7c1de851073ea43b12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30f891763f27bcbe5d56cccb36d6f2bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38e4e4685ab5a6fd9bc66286303da755, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47064946413b76ba88e844b5426066ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4731ade0a4cc1057ec4a295fd51eb614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4784f116272539c48037275b9e775e5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a5a7cdfb8965cf163e5342258a82d59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61411c3c1372a4382503cde8a6efd560, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61566d8dc528ecbfec3f7a1329dc236f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dca63b5c5889128508d0e9074a25f50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71d8e3b03d4dce1152387591c643a703, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78d99a57b5fc2dbba1a227efdeac4d82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85590fe441355b9fa46b6ee3f0646cd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dffcb909e742be2c42035e85978423b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99cfaed285fde3ddf4e012b2f90cba14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dde153becc71856cc2d06db0d014511, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2cc5ec31bfab74dbc398fab9a0e5431, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3f715ade16a8c79a50b3fecdd3be00a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9452f41738725a960f9f80b2c6dd7c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caeb4e32f6ead96cd4e9139c87823396, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb77c9ed8d53c6b5a338d0a7e8835b4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf3b0e6f4c0cfeff8ece0d20b6b2df68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d411a0c2d7b5e9def840b46ad8e80eff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e132b204f2e6f45c1569ff558f47ab20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e67b31dd53f44b74af179b4b00e823f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d8eecf862f83ced5e13478da90dd82"

The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures. We discuss the role of modelling in public health and we analyse the distinction between forecasting and projection models as assessing tools for the estimation of the impact of intervention strategies. The model is applied to the communities of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) and it mimics those epidemics with fairly good accuracy. The estimated values for the basic reproduction number, R 0, were 1.2 for Hong Kong and 1.32 for Toronto (Canada). The model projects that, in the absence of control, the final number of cases would be 320,000 in Hong Kong and 36,900 in Toronto (Canada). In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). Although SARS can be a devastating infection, early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate precaution measures, can be very effective to limit its spread.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dcff0e853c855921151c03a7fba3320, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ad1f0f3ba2088507d1ca07eebd20bbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/645b7fe7928a8af17520a0ae7db2692d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6aa917bd83243eaf517b9a0f9b5b6c03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6da6a780c6453fc2afbc2c2d624d8c73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7522b47d96a21fc88e9bba03920eb5f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fe2fc1832ea37c1da6b4998ee053780, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/833575e8c2bbdca8d05d17619688a1fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8553f348fa5d5dc19cc33e23e9b15dbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b9cb7ded7a8ede254be520a3f84595a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a19ee62125bed853130d977a17d96d67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3c3277c0b3545e054478590ea435002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6178df0762e8f5f98c033991cbe3f07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7f0939dde08c5250c8437df2826c58a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c854d1f4a0be537c96b8599d9f642be4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3334207ffa8eea588d67eb6740de60b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef1c33765bc69dfd156efb05c26d1bb2"

In the present study, we performed detailed genome analysis of CyunNPV and compared its genome to those of other Group I alphabaculoviruses. Sequencing of the CyunNPV genome using the Roche 454 sequencing system generated 142,900 bp with a G + C content of 45%. Genome analysis predicted a total of 147 hypothetical open reading frames comprising 38 baculoviral core genes, 24 lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes, nine Group I Alphabaculovirus conserved genes, 71 common genes, and five genes that are unique to CyunNPV. In addition, the genome contains 13 homologous repeated sequences (hrs). Phylogenetic analysis groups CyunNPV under a distinct branch within clade “a” of Group I in the genus Alphabaculovirus. Unlike other members of Group I, CyunNPV harbors only nine of the 11 genes previously determined to be specific to Group I viruses. Furthermore, the CyunNPV lacks the tyrosine phosphatase gene and the ac30 gene. The CyunNPV F-like protein contains two insertions of continuous polar amino acids, one at the conventional fusion peptide and a second insertion at the pre-transmembrane domain. The insertions are likely to affect the fusion function and suggest an evolutionary process that led to inactivation of the F-like protein. The above findings imply that CyunNPV is a distinct species under Group I Alphabaculovirus.

Linear dextran applied as a blood plasma substitute demonstrates a high rate of biocompatibility. Dextran is present in foods, drugs, and vaccines and in most cases is applied as a biologically inert substance. In this review we analyze dextran’s cellular uptake principles, receptor specificity and, therefore, its ability to interfere with pathogen–lectin interactions: a promising basis for new antimicrobial strategies. Dextran-binding receptors in humans include the DC-SIGN (dendritic cell–specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin) family receptors: DC-SIGN (CD209) and L-SIGN (the liver and lymphatic endothelium homologue of DC-SIGN), the mannose receptor (CD206), and langerin. These receptors take part in the uptake of pathogens by dendritic cells and macrophages and may also participate in the modulation of immune responses, mostly shown to be beneficial for pathogens per se rather than host(s). It is logical to predict that owing to receptor-specific interactions, dextran or its derivatives can interfere with these immune responses and improve infection outcome. Recent data support this hypothesis. We consider dextran a promising molecule for the development of lectin–glycan interaction-blocking molecules (such as DC-SIGN inhibitors) that could be applied in the treatment of diseases including tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS, etc. Dextran derivatives indeed change the pathology of infections dependent on DC-SIGN and mannose receptors.

However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested. Here, we studied 6 young and 12 old Chinese rhesus macaques (ChRM) over the course of three months after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239 infection. Old ChRM showed a higher risk of accelerated AIDS development than did young macaques, owing to rapidly elevated plasma viral loads and decreased levels of CD4(+) T cells. The low frequency of naïve CD4(+) T cells before infection was strongly predictive of an increased disease progression, whereas the severe depletion of CD4(+) T cells and the rapid proliferation of naïve lymphocytes accelerated the exhaustion of naïve lymphocytes in old ChRM. Moreover, in old ChRM, a robust innate host response with defective regulation was associated with a compensation for naïve T cell depletion and a high level of immune activation. Therefore, we suggest that immunosenescence plays an important role in the accelerated AIDS progression in elderly individuals and that SIV-infected old ChRM may be a favorable model for studying AIDS pathogenesis and researching therapies for elderly AIDS patients.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0253f2b14b8a9ac6b9844a6172d68069, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03d77ba1c74ea33b6cec52ee8e6a0d84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/189090a45d93d6b3e0a6707896a7e2a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cd4b907c9ac43dcc4c2efe730fcfd44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25c120101552447a6666a769a6aac42e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4af3ce67b06a3c21751c68efe2ab62ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e465d686ae6cb783b810ba32f8d0e11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62db08c14739858161e918f663bf21ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6680b851e6648517786ed77f4a01e06e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/697827ab29e85e273e91d1d8addd4b08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b9b5f33187d14cb96d82ee3e62faf74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fe4716314bd661524a7c9d555639852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79d51c3fff596a38025df9b16ccad1ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913984f8c457144eaf8119fdb254fbe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a316f3cf0917529e3fa3c61a8210d76c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab291e4e99b296dfb63881e0bd5e5978, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ce091fefbbbd2f1abf4ca5fa1d8aae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc313e7504049f5e9c670c8b70a59177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cde26820930c6ba2a30e776ffd2f0d17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcb52be4f67b9e24b2becc0b77aee77d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7d0be8ab8dff4db59a058b6644709ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef30f6664563c2b47e94b04cad7e6b97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f48c924c97e60173353375a828f9687d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f63df163fcebe5c9e354eb2d58f678f6"

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. METHODS: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)) or normoxic (21% O(2)/5% CO(2)) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P < 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-α−converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/TACE.

ABs are produced during a viable but non-infectious developmental state termed “persistence” or “chlamydial stress.” As persistent/stressed chlamydiae: (i) may contribute to chronic inflammation observed in diseases like trachoma; and (ii) are more resistant to current anti-chlamydial drugs of choice, it is critical to better understand this developmental stage. We previously demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) co-infection induced Chlamydia pecorum persistence/stress in culture. One critical characteristic of persistence/stress is that the chlamydiae remain viable and can reenter the normal developmental cycle when the stressor is removed. Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited. Therefore, we performed time course experiments in which Vero cells were C. pecorum/PEDV infected in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits viral but not chlamydial protein synthesis. CHX-exposure inhibited PEDV replication, but did not inhibit induction of C. pecorum persistence at 24 h post-PEDV infection, as indicated by AB formation and reduced production of infectious EBs. Interestingly, production of infectious EBs resumed when CHX-exposed, co-infected cells were incubated 48–72 h post-PEDV co-infection. These data demonstrate that PEDV co-infection-induced chlamydial persistence/stress is reversible and suggest that this induction (i) does not require viral replication in host cells; and (ii) does not require de novo host or viral protein synthesis. These data also suggest that viral binding and/or entry may be required for this effect. Because the PEDV host cell receptor (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) stimulates cellular signaling pathways in the absence of PEDV infection, we suspect that PEDV co-infection might alter CD13 function and induce the chlamydiae to enter the persistent state.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/051dd381681abdf83ce5a67ff6164755, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f02072169cefbe1e57eb7d11181c4c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1996b89526ed4d4fe5280681bbed989b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0c1888ea5d017cebff6e9b8b6e0fa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b99f25c317c559c99fa82ee43549cf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c240b1838ba603e2abef4ba591e5081, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27b013e8f1f6ea11823462487aae08d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a18f8c9ce4a2de8c7fc6de21f90277f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b6e6abc695bf54015a8c9011eeec5f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bc79330b016156f0c47953c4590e7ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/361d2e6e23138c97476dad208373521d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/388e9bc40700cec52ebcb924ed26ed6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39739fa149de26689d36badde8a40dd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b6cb543606423f777659d2b83d096e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bf60896d944c47da0313326f0627d91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e023266d941a9afc441fd425b18e22a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1e9a57309358fa0265afe1901329c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e382ea0f9fb78dd5d0baecc20ea91a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3eac9a69e9c4d55fa3385754e93deb1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42ac511c773a71a8723a855a217bc31b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d174ee58f69ff5c1ea8a9e65fa54b0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50ae71100d44b59efe8078c46ad7b7e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/521fbbb39537d182d5efde3914a5a4ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56efc31e5f84d380f07babbaa7130cc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b07ecf33eda5c27f25d00f3b3722568, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f105ec561b10d030e72232b1cd50a8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60f35d9f3b2ba191893612afda9e2bb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61d418f9e0d575f07e13f8b7f77d6c1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71f73cb312b13f315c94d38ac8fd1cbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7728321de6cf6c124a58201387cf03d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/779f58aee087cc29c8bff066607f04d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b5a35017d327681f7ae5a0d66219acb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fa1c81e89ad4364586252c7408e254f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/807691b5e3392c26c54801e773bd3488, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80f08eb6541f0f46eb5f0965c74177fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82ea38cbde4849cb358e4546fc859d6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88e79805c9551ef3334afbee30f8ef13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b3f59d10ba89cd77943226db1d6009a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ed4e37d1affe20ec9cb672e59d2c4cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/916481a045be90c17514ea84babdb203, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9228b23f80f50a944fba1b0ef955b825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d594484e4b1f33b253fd3dd47cf7d05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a211a162681bb7386205abf8e533264d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b598d275b6c4d11fc6c9f8303a7260fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba25046d44713c662b9dc8e4b401cc66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c729ba428ab3e6c6977b44fbc93fbb90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb7f1263d4feeb35475db3ba73b5bd12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd4746a2e56b4b19f6e30e7d3ffcd91d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d92ad13d7a586cbddfd22d2851da6df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daece0565dbc12d891c051ab73246b3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1510f07ef0c0f0f4d1e8efa4f0c893e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed4123d2a20dc4698213f1cdaba2528d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f117ccafd0b388926938bad65a442b09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2ff9825598a7919bb26692df0b3d99b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc9c96073926ade3184c75c0b567bffa"

The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.",""

Despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. One of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity. Here, we quantify the co-circulation, emergence and sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages in a single swine-producing region in the United States over a span of 9 years (2009–2017). By classifying over 4,000 PRRSV sequences (open-reading frame 5) into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages, we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the PRRSV population, including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008. In addition, lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010, but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014, coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage. The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage. As host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant, this dominant (sub-) lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible. An analysis of patterns of non- synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome, further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus. This has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV that have negative impacts on the swine industry. Constant surveillance on PRRSV occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages. Further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous PRRS viruses could shed further light on PRRSV immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0865d783e8da585f2c7306d369fa4f51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f8450f6502a9dc15233bcb0142d5bf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1093b3c5d43383af59b57b7622476a0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1253343190006b6766bb0b3d8dda53da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/197eb723a26ebc391a1fe58db6b4fbcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bf74edceb6a5f0f927dc8bdf670291f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ec3b2a6b8a8f7de371978ca4d347e98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f74de66d17fb63eac6384a2a2647603, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/313e3c841c78b37fb512e1877db6c10c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/354df3c1b560a17aefa80092a75979ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44f7aafc1e32cda51001b958fed17335, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45061209a08d92bc791491b960b751c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f6c781ba1403048a46578047e586d64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c96eef6fe2c6cfc7b14d64a1bb5ca5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e465fb05e8eae5259045165850b9122, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67463ecef60c9be07d4ea4b285c7fbac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d5868539ecc9c8c8b1c6fd7797add25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f41339e6267a40a48dc49dc37022f91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/703611e00be6717783ef9dfd37bff758, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75afd6405eab317613a8b9f8d9995b4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ab103630cf1a559899f01028a8890b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c6c1ad0b03887ec0306a39ec57f17c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/918b1f7a9b3b71d973a0e417f55fe852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/928bc199c6734064e54ef50bfa8c5c8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96fdce608458b42374dbb248c4630aaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97e7ede379dbf1b3e4695544fec1d8ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a064902a804a9dc8d012c8857689deba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a19969194fcab4b1e97b48d2b23e9860, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9333c821dd28bd974ef53876d952a3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0880ea89e638db6a442dbd0d5f08199, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c575557cbd0ddbc56c14bd7932f58778, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7d33cf5a078b3fbb8d59bf560ac0cfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd7f42d88ee859109b4b9da3037f6568, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5ef3cd26d688e9b21f1f48c0852fa78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdd7660193ba3bceca516e32e4d1949c"

A growing body of evidence points to an inseparable link between attributes of the nursing work environment and nurse and patient outcomes. While most studies have adopted a survey design to examine the workforce and work environment issues, this study employed a phenomenological approach to provide empirical evidence regarding nurses’ perceptions of their work and work environment. Aim The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover through exploring frontline registered nurses’ lived experiences of working in Hong Kong public hospitals. Methods and participants A modified version of Van Kaam's controlled explication method was adopted. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 frontline nurses recruited from ten acute regional, district and non-acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. Their perspectives in regard to their work and work environment, such as workload, manpower demand and professional values, were extensively examined, and a hypothetical description relating the nursing work environment with nurses’ turnover intention was posited. Results Contemplation of nurses’ experiences revealed the vulnerable aspects of nursing work and six essential constituents of the nursing work environment, namely staffing level, work responsibility, management, co-worker relationships, job, and professional incentives. These essential constituents have contributed to two sets of forces, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, which originate from the attributes of the nursing work environment. Nurses viewed harmonious co-worker relationships, recognition and professional development as the crucial retaining factors. However, nurses working in an unfavorable environment were overwhelmed by destabilizing forces; they expressed frustration and demonstrated an intention to leave their work environment. Conclusions The nursing work environment is a complex entity comprising multiple constituents; its attributes affect nurses’ perceptions of their work and work environment, which warrant special attention in addressing the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover.",""

Even though cynomolgus macaques from different geographic regions are used for these studies, there has been limited characterization of full-length major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I immunogenetics of distinct geographic populations. Here, we identified 48 MHC class I cDNA nucleotide sequences in eleven Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, including 41 novel Mafa-A and Mafa-B sequences. We found seven MHC class I sequences in Indonesian macaques that were identical to MHC class I sequences identified in Malaysian or Mauritian macaques. Sharing of nucleotide sequences between these geographically distinct populations is also consistent with the hypothesis that Indonesia was a source of the Mauritian macaque population. In addition, we found that the Indonesian cDNA sequence Mafa-B*7601 is identical throughout its peptide binding domain to Mamu-B*03, an allele that has been associated with control of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) viremia in Indian rhesus macaques. Overall, a better understanding of the MHC class I alleles present in Indonesian cynomolgus macaques improves their value as a model for disease research, and it better defines the biogeography of cynomolgus macaques throughout Southeast Asia.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1643b9aef01483fe65c6277d3f32726a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2845422746c75a72dde4e57420bb9a3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/302189cc3197fae6d941933e6065e6ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3323e705b60a8db4c26775aec0c7c51b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33b15e6b832ef6fda5259b910395ec32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37d1d511c7f1a38cae273bea530bdbdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1f918732db05ecf78c89a04c13300b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40223a64e4a77bea55597cde486c75cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40c41e50ca617da4bcd10bec029000f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d0352f574f1e5d497177bf0e6ea7d7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5edb55b016b4c865c02e6cb7779213b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e541c9ac4d1b6f2e8548fda40240a26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74823f85ca9527d1a63d85d4bd992024, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/785108aa00986cb60de00dddd0ed0bac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80420ca7f097286cf8f51e2365a69fbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/878533938cf9818ddad16a0853bf0280, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a17f185a55f687042dbdc45752b11481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1daea339d6231faac7dca7d796001e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba1f9824eba34ea432e81db618f29215, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baf67c9aff0f3beb613315fdccb8bb6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bafa7b2def50115180cb0292c30b7e22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf152a20f062f5228269da7eac23b630, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5d585cbddb069531b447d2639e651d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c647fa6cb93a171f0e1b8c789989ed10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8b6220121834926be621c85fcfaf4cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf2c161ac22b3b5a521eb0b99cd460ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc83e9710c6f76291e1171c9bf59dd46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0c86d737c9df0370dc2c468f2ae6266, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e49beedadbd152ea5c787ad99638f701, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4a30744617a61c82f28fbe3eb9ae7c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e73092e16fa2795a32de1c3a3d9760d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e98bed83df773fd65a6781e18849e674, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f627fd339547e2cf794da9d3ebf4a5e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa2a47164bed2cc9766f995a0ad82440, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fadb47d564bda16615085f8e16e7c1fe"

However, long-term repetitive delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) would require enhanced protein stability and ease of administration to improve patient compliance. Chloroplast expression of therapeutic proteins enables their bioencapsulation within plant cells to protect against gastric enzymatic degradation and facilitates long-term storage at room temperature. Besides, fusion to a transmucosal carrier helps effective systemic absorption from the intestine on oral delivery. We hypothesized that bioencapsulating ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) fused to the cholera nontoxin B subunit would enable development of an oral delivery system that is effective in treating PH. PH was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by monocrotaline administration. Subset of animals was simultaneously treated with bioencapsulaed ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) (prevention protocol). In a separate set of experiments, drug treatment was initiated after 2 weeks of PH induction (reversal protocol). Oral feeding of rats with bioencapsulated ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) prevented the development of monocrotaline-induced PH and improved associated cardiopulmonary pathophysiology. Furthermore, in the reversal protocol, oral ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) treatment significantly arrested disease progression, along with improvement in right heart function, and decrease in pulmonary vessel wall thickness. In addition, a combination therapy with ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) augmented the beneficial effects against monocrotaline-induced lung injury.

A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fa58bb368177c0d48f1d469b302dd5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/167c29b9a0808a839f31e998b269d5fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/174cebc21a99e79876132c54c245fdb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c1ee7d427a33fff096e1c0706b35ed4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f323516a419dd15153cae5ee3c12fd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37b73f019edb349f285f0708695505d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46d6080d807491f075334ee98f6d0db6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5030492138c1b655cb83b4afbbcd11d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68b22bdcf7af2587c7f9a04bec1cd946, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bae734f201b04eaa1512d8558d500e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a22f7c7844ac9cc135cae67308d11978, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa7d79f1bbe35bd691b23bbeaf9988a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb928918419994a45afec14f4b7e7d7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd59190d110357b7090f1adda78675e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdb8948a798983fae6f6926384f6c24b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce8f37bdb023e9c0cee048130ff7bb71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6f6b5394b0a9e5c0b33a2db6213c941, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecf2c80bd55e9fdbc6a284ce86a5596e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed83b8a4a1ac1520dcdef148e1f86b72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee86e77e1531958ded084e8c11f83ee3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f206b3ded76880cc877037cfa62bb2f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f352ef815d6d3c4860decd54cf4ddbf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf5173c697287f629a34eaf3255525a"

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission. METHODS: We estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July–August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines. FINDINGS: We estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5·2 and 7·1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%. INTERPRETATION: Dose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fa0dd895cac5c84987aa246548f421b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f75ef7434a1df30929eed764fe6c795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/436ef19d0a078d2b2fc3876d49342ef5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c7cac846908a3ffdd53a689f4ea8d67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ed6d865d3591a76456e2874984af62c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8871c171d424c6a08c3b0e592c06665d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be500561843715a1cca4154371e38037, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7756dabc9fbc25c4d5d2eb3c1818880, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1f80bc124cc2ec92bd5549c54adce7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb23775fa00df43bc2ff368e39119ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9c25c5db5adddf0ff031da9f014e194, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fee9d58893e7506724b4acd44c8293b1"

No family was found to be ubiquitous and even peptidases thought to be essential for life, such as signal peptidase and methionyl aminopeptides are missing from some clades. There are 33 peptidase families common to archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and are assumed to have originated in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). These include peptidases with different catalytic types, exo- and endopeptidases, peptidases with different tertiary structures and peptidases from different families but with similar structures. This implies that the different catalytic types and structures pre-date LUCA. Other families have had their origins in the ancestors of viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and a number of families have had their origins in the ancestors of particular phyla.

Besides the consensus that spontaneous conversion of normal cellular PrP(C) into misfolded and aggregating PrP(Sc) is the central event in prion disease, an alternative hypothesis suggests the generation of pathological PrP(Sc) by rare translational frameshifting events in the octa-repeat domain of the PrP mRNA. Ribosomal frameshifting most commonly relies on a slippery site and an adjacent stable RNA structure to stall translating ribosome. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the secondary structure of the octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA. Each of the five octa-repeats contains a motif (GGCGGUGGUGGCUGGG) which alone in vitro forms a G-quadruplex. Since the propensity of mRNA to form secondary structure depends on the sequence context, we set to determine the structure of the complete octa-repeat region. We assessed the structure of full-length octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysis by primer extension (SHAPE). Our data show that the PrP octa-repeat mRNA forms stable A-helical hairpins with no evidence of G-quadruplex structure even in the presence of G-quadruplex stabilizing agents.",""

However, unlike traditional model organisms, such as yeast, flies and worms, choanoflagellates have been refractory to DNA delivery methods for expressing foreign genes. Here we report the establishment of a robust method for expressing transgenes in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, overcoming barriers that have previously hampered DNA delivery and expression. To demonstrate how this method accelerates the study of S. rosetta cell biology, we engineered a panel of fluorescent protein markers that illuminate key features of choanoflagellate cells. We then investigated the localization of choanoflagellate septins, a family of GTP-binding cytoskeletal proteins that are hypothesized to regulate the multicellular rosette development in S. rosetta. Fluorescently tagged septins localized to the basal pole of S. rosetta single cells and rosettes in a pattern resembling septin localization in animal epithelia. The establishment of transfection in S. rosetta and its application to the study of septins represent critical advances in the growth of S. rosetta as an experimental model for investigating choanoflagellate cell biology, core mechanisms underlying animal cell biology, and the origin of animals.",""

The olfactory (piriform) cortex has long been hypothesized to encode odor memories, yet the cellular substrates for olfactory learning and memory remain unknown. Here, using intersectional, cFos-based genetic manipulations (“Fos-tagging”), we show that olfactory fear conditioning activates sparse and distributed ensembles of neurons in mouse piriform cortex. We demonstrate that chemogenetic silencing of these Fos-tagged piriform ensembles selectively interferes with odor fear memory retrieval, but does not compromise basic odor detection and discrimination. Furthermore, chemogenetic reactivation of piriform neurons that were Fos-tagged during olfactory fear conditioning causes a decrease in exploratory behavior, mimicking odor-evoked fear memory recall. Together, our experiments identify odor-specific ensembles of piriform neurons as necessary and sufficient for odor fear memory recall.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17e786a3e83fc28932bccb43d4e821f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27c8f583d93f0400ab904a7ef60d20f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28b2ea27b600fdc73b19b706c9b8f8b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d24613fe2ae8a16c6b7293ab4f227c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/317403c4e5f0bc64ec8812f276e055a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/329f81a4be3353f6c8f5e79aefbd87ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3303bf6cebb9dbcb8c7353aa734a4cff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34facc74ac536e1aae13bd640755543f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/379efd07ba6e2e9e3706c2b98d09ca28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45d6384012f19e410d31bfacf52e27c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50c75875c5bc4c7674a777f08946f8ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57b2a76efe4888cecd1bd1bbee3d9e79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/644a074d4652f1226dfa150797c9a310, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d7b924f2d72ba4a95e1ce54119b77f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8453f156afc8442c5c59b80c162e3804, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bf18839623d90487cfaf60120019a15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4bcb4d853ec3d6e2aca6590cf732783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a962082f9f931a8a29c6188ae8d17d06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab88c30bb1b2abdfe63bdc9a3337157c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d26f0a6120fce27a9ffb369f67a277cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4eaf80c6d2b80bfc39839f5538e0593, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa61b6de2c475923b74cd2004e8fb8d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcdefc33c661e2414c57118b05edc135"

We identified 12 studies using the test-negative design (2011–2017) that reported VE estimates separately derived by 3 alternative control groups: 1) all patients testing negative for influenza (FLU), VE(FLU−); 2) patients who tested positive for other/another respiratory virus (ORV), VE(ORV+); and 3) patients who tested negative for all viruses in the panel (PAN), VE(PAN−). These included VE estimates from 7 countries for all age groups from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014. We observed no difference in vaccination coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative control groups. A total of 63 VE(FLU−) estimates, 62 VE(ORV+) estimates, and 33 VE(PAN−) estimates were extracted. Pooled estimates of the difference in VE (ΔVE) were very similar between groups.

Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39f4b9b620822d913d52541b4f9b44ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43a795877a357c4aa83e5d734ccedfb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bdcaf983d86dd582ecc02b8d4b34290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7c0ecf1326c83a4b0b10835505650a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c078acc9b59f500fcef92a4eb1360b05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e310853ce5e843fa78a181c0799c064e"

A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient’s weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted. Studies which, along these lines, show an environmental impact on genetic secretion in the phenotype are underlined.

This process of immune homeostasis, as maintained by dendritic cells, is susceptible to dysregulation by certain pathogens during chronic infections. Such dysregulation may lead to disease perpetuation with potentially severe systemic consequences. Here we discuss in detail how intracellular pathogens exploit dendritic cells and evade degradation by altering or evading autophagy. This novel mechanism explains in part the chronic, persistent nature observed in several immuno-inflammatory diseases, including periodontal disease. Also, here we propose a hypothetical model on the plausible role of autophagy in the context of periodontal disease. Promotion of autophagy may open new therapeutic strategies in the search for a “cure” for periodontal disease in humans.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b69a17f9a14cab81049f17026dfa64f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d0ad184a19082e6171d41f8feadbb23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a446dc2d0d394c5f7de6f694fdd6183, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39d402c32cd44432dfa408a2500b7b8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5498946854ed4e287598c10267736c0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f134dcc93443a454070798b8aaa857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e6193ad512bc8a174785c2a32fe8a70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bd23ca1341577916a75ad9d9a1bd77d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4b35535d56622c1b49c3d911b104174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac9842cde828816a50525b1a952f0c46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba3dfc784b3ffb0889e2e725979d64e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7e0eafe205fef0e0183633ac198a060, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d07e96909438bba9c1f7e1177efe2321, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8109b8515b9c04030e8176e041307a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f59c188c02d70c4c9858020665b51fc3"

OBJECTIVE: To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness. DESIGN: Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: Madison, Wisconsin, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. METHODS: 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise (EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October, with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence, duration, and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism, health care utilization, and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. RESULTS: Of 413 participants randomized, 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group, 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers, 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 244, 386), 256 (193, 318) for EX, and 336 (268, 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR (p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX (p = 0.042), compared to control, not quite attaining the p<0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group, 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers, and 105 days and 24 visits among controls. Viruses were identified in 63 ARI episodes in the MBSR group, compared to 64 for EX and 72 for control. Statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in general mental health, self-efficacy, mindful attention, sleep quality, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBSR and/or EX groups, compared to control. CONCLUSIONS: Training in mindfulness meditation or exercise may help protect against ARI illness. LIMITATIONS: This trial was likely underpowered.

We hypothesized that DAD, the most severe form of acute lung injury, would lead to the highest risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and that a type I immune response would mediate this process. Objectives: Determine whether DAD is associated with CLAD and explore the potential role of CXCR3/ligand biology. Methods: Transbronchial biopsies from all lung transplant recipients were reviewed. The association between the four injury patterns and subsequent outcomes were evaluated using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, and CXCL11/ITAC) were compared between allograft injury patterns and “healthy” biopsies using linear mixed-effects models. The effect of these chemokine alterations on CLAD risk was assessed using Cox models with serial BAL measurements as time-dependent covariates. Measurements and Main Results: There were 1,585 biopsies from 441 recipients with 62 episodes of DAD. An episode of DAD was associated with increased risk of CLAD (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–4.7) and death (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.0). There were marked elevations in BAL CXCR3 ligand concentrations during DAD. Furthermore, prolonged elevation of these chemokines in serial BAL fluid measurements predicted the development of CLAD. Conclusions: DAD is associated with marked increases in the risk of CLAD and death after lung transplantation. This association may be mediated in part by an aberrant type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligands.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/030124acb796b6dfc67e0cb7038670a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0518c813bb4753f833ae16c2356a3613, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/080d1742b6ff79242d2b75ca67d9b10b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ef19bdf27b0c81bb673544286aae83f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e38fa871f3897b1ae31ee8b58d74a03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21d29deb075a854b8869ead7cd8c3128, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26829b220c2e2b17003edc9966c6a25a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26b74324b113c8e4f11fa393e329480c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27e6f7876c8a5ee9edc77b8c448642f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/319e3caa88a475ea19d8f30b3582dda1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35915880116f3c89c77aa6060c4a5c3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39ad94410e469660c5160e17d2fd8277, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e2acd47eacfe1db1d5a3814fbb312a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eb1db77f716741ea4bde0147179cffc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6668351372c5a4a98215cc59407fd3fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b4ec36695abf20c0871802decc84998, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/749651a5d6355f9332cecf29505d3139, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c5f5bef4f151d0d8f19e7d22df23ca1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82cb325cb582d4bd1ed85faa881ac983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82fdcc5cd63e1063f662290fc066df89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd6318ce528d17daa0bc03c12aa24eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c6ab9c8737900ba2a55d4e281ea8f88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e22aba2dcbefe60fb255dc122625c56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eb3b01cca2b8753c9504de784c32891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eed08c5be78b513aeead9b5cc472011, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f287e2d7b2422025dadb65cbcc54b28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0d60a8d080f95cc26ec42a785489a5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a71c1abc6b037d2abfa74bfa8cbc3a3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7ed88571931c5cb662cafac5599b970, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad4d64106b1d7c48652c5b7a526f6d00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3f59d3cef49ca49efce0759d8cb9b80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b413511f47489e7063b0cc1036363355, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dca6b7317f96a63808a018e61a3d99bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e334126332f5efeca77122f9ad48dfd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e586bca6f0d769cd610193bef7842f08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f054daaa39555fa5deec1d705ca0d1b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fda8e617e6fe7bce6f02352ba5de3bc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff71ae91c69284ca8a7ee0c98096476e"

The causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders. OBJECTIVES: To discover an antigen-specific autoimmune response associated with both emphysema and osteoporosis among smokers. METHODS: Replicate nonbiased discovery assays indicated that autoimmunity to glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and cell surface signaling receptor, is present in many smokers. Subject assessments included spirometry, chest CT scans, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and immunoblots for anti-GRP78 IgG. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were isolated from patient plasma by affinity chromatography, leukocyte functions assessed by flow cytometry, and soluble metabolites and mediators measured by immunoassays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies were detected in plasma specimens from 86 (32%) of the 265 smoking subjects. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were singularly prevalent among subjects with radiographic emphysema (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7–5.7, p = 0.003). Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were also associated with osteoporosis (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7–13.3, p = 0.002), and increased circulating bone metabolites (p = 0.006). Among emphysematous subjects, GRP78 protein was an autoantigen of CD4 T-cells, stimulating lymphocyte proliferation (p = 0.0002) and IFN-gamma production (p = 0.03). Patient-derived anti-GRP78 autoantibodies had avidities for osteoclasts and macrophages, and increased macrophage NFkB phosphorylation (p = 0.005) and productions of IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP9 (p = 0.005, 0.007, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular GRP78 autoimmune responses in smokers have numerous biologically-relevant pro-inflammatory and other deleterious actions, and are associated with emphysema and osteoporosis. These findings may have relevance for the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases, and development of biomarker immunoassays and/or novel treatments for these disorders.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21ca69178adffcd921a69020aea2a3f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39b11d8ec5b7f78db3d826d110317f3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48c135477ce1d55e672d4e3b143fecf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54f334d5747b51227364b9a955deb6b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6ad9964ac61384c950d0389bca8467e"

Prior work has demonstrated that a visual scoring system applied to chest radiographs (CXR) is associated with adverse outcomes in ICU patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patient’s CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0–4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total score’s association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05–1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07–1.17, p < 0.001). CXR scores were also independently associated with both ICU length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, CI 1.04–1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, CI 1.02–1.07, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher values on a simple visual score of a patient’s CXR on admission to the medical ICU are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0371d99dbbef1acd98e9b6d287484484, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ec74df494af2b3740c79fc5389bf71e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/148041a86bbf92bf124e4fef014c9c29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16d40bdfca4456f63ff7bf0db41fdb39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3608200758740e59f7e55efb1d68c927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a2e4daf0fe537d89c9288577934b8e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59c3e30bd5acdbd7ab651f1981e566f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6986fed4708b154191f42df350c08e33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a3d3400464dc504fabc4daff5887851, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ee7cf4c76fff5e162f04d9748adb4a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72ed6849765fa0279769f5b725e746ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81a3e45f7ab16eb26dc58e2985ef9916, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89240ffac1d6ac5b9b90946960bc9335, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f1ccfde887a7d2c2477b53147b87dd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/978ea06e3964a8f1246323a298de8ff4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0c0c953ceff71a0b9c935af3d20b09d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abf15bceb95de0120640c15eb2727ec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6da3ea4edade7b10db8515d16be0267, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1685e3113e77ab49ee80f75d0570945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb9e13529b1d8dcb3618ac1903e2ffe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e96ee0fd21de93cee3f5987210e2a5d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec0fad0d28ff3ffeb89a2717451e17f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edb3d2ad4aa2a1c7c915c9b9a922db6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f976035daa41a6f4499a53ff02c949bf"

In both physiological (meals) and pathological (infections, traumas and tumors) conditions immune cells are activated responding with the release of cytokines and other immune mediators (afferent signals). In the hypothalamus (central integration), cytokines influence metabolism by acting on nucleus involved in feeding and homeostasis regulation leading to the acute phase response (efferent signals) aimed to maintain the body integrity. Peripheral administration of cytokines, inoculation of tumor and induction of infection alter, by means of cytokine action, the normal pattern of food intake affecting meal size and meal number suggesting that cytokines acted differentially on specific hypothalamic neurons. The effect of cytokines-related cancer anorexia is also exerted peripherally. Increase plasma concentrations of insulin and free tryptophan and decrease gastric emptying and d-xylose absorption. In addition, in obesity an increase in interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 occurs in mesenteric fat tissue, which together with an increase in corticosterone, is associated with hyperglycemia, dyslipidemias and insulin resistance of obesity-related metabolic syndrome. These changes in circulating nutrients and hormones are sensed by hypothalamic neurons that influence food intake and metabolism. In anorectic tumor-bearing rats, we detected upregulation of IL-1β and IL-1 receptor mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, a negative correlation between IL-1 concentration in cerebro-spinal fluid and food intake and high levels of hypothalamic serotonin, and these differences disappeared after tumor removal. Moreover, there is an interaction between serotonin and IL-1 in the development of cancer anorexia as well as an increase in hypothalamic dopamine and serotonin production. Immunohistochemical studies have shown a decrease in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and dopamine (DA) and an increase in serotonin concentration in tumor-bearing rats, in first- and second-order hypothalamic nuclei, while tumor resection reverted these changes and normalized food intake, suggesting negative regulation of NPY and DA systems by cytokines during anorexia, probably mediated by serotonin that appears to play a pivotal role in the regulation of food intake in cancer. Among the different forms of therapy, nutritional manipulation of diet in tumor-bearing state has been investigated. Supplementation of tumor bearing rats with ω-3 fatty acid vs. control diet delayed the appearance of tumor, reduced tumor-growth rate and volume, negated onset of anorexia, increased body weight, decreased cytokines production and increased expression of NPY and decreased α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in hypothalamic nuclei. These data suggest that ω-3 fatty acid suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines production and improved food intake by normalizing hypothalamic food intake-related peptides and point to the possibility of a therapeutic use of these fatty acids. The sum of these data support the concept that immune cell-derived cytokines are closely related with the regulation of metabolism and have both central and peripheral actions, inducing anorexia via hypothalamic anorectic factors, including serotonin and dopamine, and inhibiting NPY leading to a reduction in food intake and body weight, emphasizing the interconnection of the immune and neuroendocrine systems in regulating metabolism during infectious process, cachexia and obesity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11484591436ee345c7bf68b68b8fd81d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18966f77bb04d864b0cc46d96ae2ef99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b818a07cf03fc052ac1d4816b7e9867, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20069a1122409b48b55126f4511e90b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9310e3960b16c8332a6c5ac1b33cacf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95beac898ce008e0d886dd0e3da64479, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99cd35ffa84015a874ffa58d35dbdcbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3ba3b3f7cd54beb59ec4eb1c41c834c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b521b0c43d545177a5ace1a384584e5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd955594650d461188766e3fbc04a082, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b82ecc4ea9a5de98e66985313f0ac5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c59a629a34441d7af48dcf4ef586fabd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb7a1481f38dacf37c0f273deec7ced0"

However, intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity and viremia of porcine G9 RVAs has remained largely unreported. In this study, colostrum-deprived piglets were orally infected with a porcine G9P[23] or G9P[7] strain. Histopathologically, both strains induced characteristic small intestinal lesions. Degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were observed in the extra-intestinal tissues, but most predominantly in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). RVA antigen was continuously detected in the small intestinal mucosa and MLNs, but only transiently in cells of the liver, lung, and choroid plexus. Viral RNA levels were much higher in the feces and the MLNs compared to other tissues. The onset of viremia occurred at day post infection (DPI) 1 with the amount of viral RNA reaching its peak at DPI 3 or 5, before decreasing significantly at DPI 7 and remaining detectable until DPI 14. Our data suggest that porcine G9 RVAs have a strong small intestinal tropism, are highly virulent for piglets, have the ability to escape the small intestine, spread systemically via viremia, and replicate in extra-intestinal tissues. In addition, MLNs might act as a secondary site for viral amplification and the portal of systemic entry. These results add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of human G9 RVAs, and the validity of the pig model for use with both human and pig G9 RVAs in further studies.",""

However, predicting tenable pathways of animal-to-human movement has been hindered by challenges in identifying reservoir species, cultivating zoonotic organisms in culture, and isolating full-length genomes for cloning and genetic studies. The ability to design and recover pathogens reconstituted from synthesized cDNAs has the potential to overcome these obstacles by allowing studies of replication and pathogenesis without identification of reservoir species or cultivation of primary isolates. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and recovery of the largest synthetic replicating life form, a 29.7-kb bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (Bat-SCoV), a likely progenitor to the SARS-CoV epidemic. To test a possible route of emergence from the noncultivable Bat-SCoV to human SARS-CoV, we designed a consensus Bat-SCoV genome and replaced the Bat-SCoV Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the SARS-CoV RBD (Bat-SRBD). Bat-SRBD was infectious in cell culture and in mice and was efficiently neutralized by antibodies specific for both bat and human CoV Spike proteins. Rational design, synthesis, and recovery of hypothetical recombinant viruses can be used to investigate mechanisms of transspecies movement of zoonoses and has great potential to aid in rapid public health responses to known or predicted emerging microbial threats.",""

However, pregnant women sometimes participate in this pilgrimage, despite guidelines that discourage such an undertaking due to potential fetomaternal complications. This study aimed to evaluate fetomaternal outcomes among pregnant Indian Hajj pilgrims. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at two Indian Hajj Medical Mission (IHMM)-affiliated secondary care hospitals in Saudi Arabia during the Hajj periods of August–October 2015 and 2016 and July–September 2017. All female Indian pilgrims of reproductive age who underwent pregnancy screening at secondary care IHMM hospitals during this period were included in the study. Definitive obstetric care was provided at the Makkah Maternity & Child Hospital. Data regarding the pilgrims’ obstetric characteristics, antenatal complications, management and fetomaternal outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 114 pregnant Indian pilgrims were identified during the study period. The most common antenatal complications were respiratory tract infections (51.75%), followed by iron deficiency anaemia (17.54%), hyperemesis gravidarum (14.04%), hypothyroidism (9.65%) and gestational diabetes mellitus (5.26%). There were 20 vaginal deliveries (17.54%), two Caesarean sections (1.75%) and 32 abortions (28.07%). The cumulative three-year birth rate was 24.60 per 1,000 females. CONCLUSION: During Hajj, pregnant pilgrims have a high risk of abortion, respiratory tract infections and various antenatal, perinatal and neonatal complications which may go unreported or untreated. Women should therefore be educated regarding the risk of adverse fetomaternal outcomes which may occur while undertaking a Hajj pilgrimage during pregnancy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0378de6f995dad29cc0f3b396f61b667, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/054fc0e63b86f30b7f95784b7feb57be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08700eac772f30e9217963681f59f5e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b67b43daf0a925debe26bf73fd6065d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/155e8348f599c4949e784bea3c1ebaac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/161d4b0517454260f169e6e1373a42c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ab69621923603c912a04e1b71483ed6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28ee9ae80a29be86d34d2c3e2a807b19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39b66a69dd4df31d9d5bec2524a9be23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4636a9d24a9f254803ac49971a41f7fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/504943edf91ad97ddb9c4f2d97a5153c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54fb7dd88f592ec8671a1e9c7846651c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60f127f70708419ac8e6f2d020bf111a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/634fea34ccafc7345c246f38db2f9ccf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65eaab3943c6c0a711461cf07ed794af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73b8a29c7614854fe659cb32c278356a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76b7815b85c3f46172033db4314f75d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7890ecc1e16b3ce23a973b44280db536, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ea98616ba933ccfff931ec10ae0272e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a854be63e98fa87cb17421c379ab313, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ed3447ad0d33abe9e9887c9d8251435, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/985cd914bdbd66b758676ee608bafe7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98e82388d469d77cc048eb9c5c40bd66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a91d222e377c3fe5fc0a027b176724e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6df0402383a3266f8df7d757316d4b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c27dbf2588b18e750b0f6d4ee752cebf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbbb80f8a9935530b259ea5e75a104a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d014162ce3e890fba1944b51ca54a9e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3dd9cfe6edb2f8d9be388cb74218226, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbe01e53c29c7a33018fe4b44de52acb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa28f6e77b4cbd771996364b9ed52ffb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc5ec209e33d0d5afab3e33b80073e00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdd1bc2fa1a58de7de2060a2b1e52ec9"

Its role in the nervous system is prominent but paradoxical. Studies on uninflamed or “normal” brain have generally attributed TNF-α a neuromodulatory effect. In contrast, in inflamed or diseased brain, the abundance of evidence suggests that TNF-α has an overall neurotoxic effect, which may be particularly pronounced for virally mediated neurological disease. Still others have found TNF-α to be protective under some conditions of neurological insult. It is still uncertain exactly how TNF-α is able to induce these opposing effects through receptor activation of only a limited set of cell signaling pathways. In this paper, we provide support from the literature to advance our hypothesis that one mechanism by which TNF-α can exert its paradoxical effects in the brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth factors or other cytokines.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/071e4becfd4fdca089e19e1ff2fde745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e25ee4a7e215c577c5d1664e46dc53e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10b313f9cfa328a9b2f8b73cee9b046f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11605a2d258aa7cdd631083cc661caec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/120d30787039bbb220e106f7bfc46fd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/140684c14f582e08baba8453e663bbf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/243f7251d3b7b101a8871b5f9655d542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/244c88f6b81df87d63976e7bde61e875, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2eb567179099ef6d12263fe48211af8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41faa04809268265b8387bb25e1589ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c14ef8902fa2496d02381f0d111ba31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c45ff5a474fac4644630b3107952d52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c57c7e325f4c35a9991135ff8a9e1c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71e5fa6379128c3aeb0576965182c893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77b7382fb9ae9d8af98ad64a70294c2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8568fb4f3ea60228d1dc06a3b3da2a1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a984e6847bc1bb556d9774753133cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89cd8a9ad61eed935e3f4f2fd022d28e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/928b71a5c8b8044fc1f875d2860157a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/929fc1018639e0c4da2fc4c3a3c14fc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aa1eefbec242f39bec5154e588f6fc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8951eaa4e9d705ca58cc6abf34e4542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdd4d9fc0641c01782eae4fed2b7b1cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf2653205b3326deb28949385469500e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c55da60fbee4f81c8bddc0608e057929, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd12ad369caa984874982076fb859219, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5e8a21680205cc77f45bdbf665260dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc62a34b54bf510fc38af5df6adb0308, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb713de8ff83896c1792744d29dc67a2"

IFITM3 is known to be essential for restriction of influenza virus infections in both mice and humans. Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote. Since bacterial IFITMs share minimal amino acid identity with human IFITM3, we hypothesized that examination of bacterial IFITMs in human cells would provide insight into the essential characteristics necessary for antiviral activity of IFITMs. We examined IFITMs from Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus for potential antiviral activity. Both of these IFITMs conferred a moderate level of resistance to influenza virus in human cells, identifying them as functional homologues of IFITM3. Analysis of sequence elements shared by bacterial IFITMs and IFITM3 identified two hydrophobic domains, putative S-palmitoylation sites, and conserved phenylalanine residues associated with IFITM3 interactions, which are all necessary for IFITM3 antiviral activity. We observed that, like IFITM3, bacterial IFITMs were S-palmitoylated, albeit to a lesser degree. We also demonstrated the ability of a bacterial IFITM to co-immunoprecipitate with IFITM3 suggesting formation of a complex, and also visualized strong co-localization of bacterial IFITMs with IFITM3. However, the mycobacterial IFITMs lack the endocytic-targeting motif conserved in vertebrate IFITM3. As such, these bacterial proteins, when expressed alone, had diminished colocalization with cathepsin B-positive endolysosomal compartments that are the primary site of IFITM3-dependent influenza virus restriction. Though the precise evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs is not known, our results support a model whereby transfer of a bacterial IFITM gene to eukaryotic cells may have provided a selective advantage against viral infection that was refined through the course of vertebrate evolution to include more robust signals for S-palmitoylation and localization to sites of endocytic virus trafficking.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0806a619ec9b29512cb44c3391e8e88d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a09b359b24f9a8b5ccafc2f6dcf301f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b5a690d8b531cc4da0568478e0c71f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/111c893ff7bb3ee327fe4fe629fac51a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12160cb5cb3abddfe0e3c41c7b7c3b9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1502913e91dec54f53a18fae48f82abd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1572719091c18fdcb3c3f616165d7378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19a46201e513775d3dc7622fb6202e36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0a4ec1fb5fd495a2205ec510bc808e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d359614c2eba33db23a1a0a8c26fd2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/232ac98baaebf7d63ba79d5300a447bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27795aaaca430a63c63800007b2d1117, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2960b985db80bacf07c0e604cbc67419, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48fe9e9fe8b46897d09642fdc44ea8e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cf4286bb60207fc1f6ac58f4a34cb4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d6a6e8a33aabe2a4606674b56720418, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/500b51bfb7c20b9df04ef8cb9263fb6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/514c925cd13f093690741091c064d973, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c41ec348145a9469481d8c2fbfed8de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c4eb03013e31b09835090ece8de52eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e8d89a287496f0476d908e27940dcbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60b6b43cf8bf1d0ef8351d886ee7cd9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60c616241b2d4978e41ab6b5667d0225, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/678ef5fbd6bbd4c70dd56e6f2ad575f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68212f7081601d11d43173908e4d487b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cb839b1774de60c7c6ec186c3ba105e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dec01ae76a1e927e3086b1f4e1549e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72ae6e4328fd53306657d25433ad0770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/769593bcd21d0a5dec919064880dd366, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/789f748efc12ef43ab41ee40ecd082ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81c1391523aa4af9d616f992697c0f8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84f8881b3adc34bd0e3ea8a161d68418, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/852dc5ec25a897cb03ec11428e16c9c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c796ea80c5c37e34ce0512b64f93f81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d8ba0a3053fe508830e1e7dd57a7ea5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a18b860ff9a23f7d45821ad2ff627ee6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2f01a4395467924acb030a581d82633, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a35362c2fb65250e32533630244231c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4e887e3141dbc683aebb24698ea4775, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5fc1c30f372b2c665e6c1b872b903de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae3314c5b6f3a1953d9071385e05c612, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b587a24cc730f823de859e3ff537135c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b876b339674d38dd59eb5a22c5a7d000, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf355c96a5533368786460342f19101c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0aa9c62da487b3636ad69e7650cb487, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4f00ffe5d3bf6b82927fdc1d52a6f9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d095a21c40ab98c89e37f00001acee4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1d6684bfc8159e75893036c73ad65b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2baafa0f564381801ad351941829645, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d79c3c5d7ae2f89ed47b09bf316709c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcda755ae4de1afc1456e53512908ed8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e559a1ac557fc7aecda034c9948f9db5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e66caf713b896ca427f157e5774ca805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1d285fa4cbe2fe5a0a00d6784998b01"

Based on genome size, they are far separated from all other ssRNA+ viruses (below 19.6 kb), including the distantly related Arteriviridae (12.7–15.7 kb; ‘small nidoviruses’). Exceptionally for ssRNA+ viruses, large nidoviruses encode a 3′-5′exoribonuclease (ExoN) that was implicated in controlling RNA replication fidelity. Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus. This Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), named after a Vietnamese province, was isolated from mosquitoes and is yet to be linked to any pathology. The genome of this enveloped 60–80 nm virus is 20,192 nt and has a nidovirus-like polycistronic organization including two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b followed by several smaller 3′-proximal ORFs. Peptide sequencing assigned three virion proteins to ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are expressed from two 3′-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. The NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b frameshifting signal and various replicative proteins were tentatively mapped to canonical positions in the nidovirus genome. They include six nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains, as well as the ExoN and 2′-O-methyltransferase that are specific to large nidoviruses. NDiV ORF1b also encodes a putative N7-methyltransferase, identified in a subset of large nidoviruses, but not the uridylate-specific endonuclease that – in deviation from the current paradigm - is present exclusively in the currently known vertebrate nidoviruses. Rooted phylogenetic inference by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods indicates that NDiV clusters with roniviruses and that its branch diverged from large nidoviruses early after they split from small nidoviruses. Together these characteristics identify NDiV as the prototype of a new nidovirus family and a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05019a256ceb12b1f4e97368ebb9d8fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/050bb70940dba11d526471cb29264b6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/080a07eae9a305758d35ab131369939c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12387624a71acf50cff835e63353203e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18f2eb9093eb08411d12100b3eb35a07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a8155de6de40cabdb05df35f478de9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2526d63d82f4de2e74fbf71cc4857cdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/267c397c61957256af67ea14c1fe844c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29c810b1651161623d0613f3fd1bed52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fbe3561b7e11a094a596cf4fdd23f20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36ca5f8fe28e020451dd1d4e9b244a08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d6c85ce1deeb3e74ea8e1821c9aac9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/420fdc6fa6449e65d1224d863691ed43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/429400d8dd3b83f17d98e092063baa52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47934105f393c3e1cfc32b391de46efa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51233dced3c513f8162d3916e9023eb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53424142edb1d154feb04207032ff0b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5579361e492d48fec62b54d52d96bf29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/610c855fceb7ece063a318d79db7b848, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/637701a2159e45b0b765f37d7e86f4f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/678ade4e7dee574cfa5688a941bcb06e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ac144cf3b23212c37f553d93c3d45c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/703fe24bc5d2c22cecf15af9e0e39d92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76e54b9c52059187ff1b1d6b50fac381, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79265ae42f99f58b99de412ef6fa74bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8109475bacbd2937c64ecfd512c2c92a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82435903a35f6fe018d931ff448b23ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8571d73ac223b3efc9cf9d532e7fc41b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8841628c767cdafad6cb9974e7387dc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94e4aaca0a6c83eb2cdc44ecbe888569, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/959f9a483c1a251369b2f57444f384e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a51ae303eb380df25a25bfa9b107005, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a578f39e70d99c82c29118d657066c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c1b451f7a8e0de31626732009b2bdbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ce8fc1fc0147db3e10ec3bd00bcdf47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e5f5931f05384768479617ab98d5751, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a380da1d756dc4a3c62465f7ddb791f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b35e4c164fe7cc43fee4088ad5033002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b548f4d6d76d156c8363c8bdceb3de85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7035a0f98d60b706fa372613d147f9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b75cd97a24e44cd1e30eff379e081279, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8485a207d173e0d83f413f5daf218a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc36caa346b4ab29046531729509cd6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdcfc1874faf10b711951b88e2d6e068, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c52ef2548d5a2dfa0f70287fe35da084, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6e1ae2cabb86136863b279c901bc743, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c880bc3cc3ce7e53266a8f297afcfbd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d81c6652ac3bd723fe49489c7a476c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d88c6f4736b56a17a7aba390c4bbaeaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8c77ff755ad5c5d5cc977d44aaf0afd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e64acb916086a18f1bdd74319424732a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9483db531f5507ebdbcb236680f7c1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9d915d13b3aa571d055bd211105495f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb2f4701adde3a96850d6207cef951dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcc2b900c804c526d4d4385a1e158158, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/febee3d21b3dc242815c515807276f07"

We examined the effect of these factors in a population-based sample of adults with ILI. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in community-dwelling Australian adults nested within an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. On presentation with ILI, participants were swabbed for a range of respiratory viruses and asked to return a questionnaire collecting details of household members with or without similar symptoms. We used logistic and Poisson regression to assess the key characteristics of household transmission. RESULTS: 258 participants from multi-occupancy households experienced 279 ILI episodes and returned a questionnaire. Of these, 183 were the primary case in the household allowing assessment of factors associated with transmission. Transmission was significantly associated in univariate analyses with female sex (27% vs. 13%, risk ratio (RR) = 2.13 (1.08, 4.21)) and the presence of a child in the house (33% vs. 17%, RR = 1.90 (1.11, 3.26)). The secondary household attack proportion (SHAP) was 0.14, higher if influenza was isolated (RR = 2.1 (1.0, 4.5)). Vaccinated participants who nonetheless became infected with influenza had a higher SHAP (Incidence RR = 5.24 (2.17, 12.6)). CONCLUSIONS: The increased SHAP in households of vaccinated participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza infection supports the hypothesis that in years of vaccine mismatch, not only is influenza vaccine less protective for the vaccine recipient, but that the population’s immunity is also lower.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04289b1afe7002c070f51e7b19182e50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/225917801635d80890744aa5caeb2a38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91fa0db90c04b6f724fc021b8af3d0ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab022df45b25f4728163e5332bf43dee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bee39f2e75f7e36b2ed36349b05eb6b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8833696e4f3128fea24b61a7201ccdc"

Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.",""

The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding. Data gathered with IBDV mutants expressing C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides generated by reverse genetics demonstrate that the VP5-PIP binding domain is required both for its PM targeting in infected cells, and for efficient virus dissemination. Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03adf3351d8d5c58f348ff6c25886c6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05b4fc75e779b131f98d27e3e0897814, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ed6e47866dffcd61b12f9e338a613b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1830efd6ca8b550d2165a32ce10457ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b77bd07fb6d9cf39d971e349556980e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bbc085c3955db19067b6489fc6c5690, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d595557244dbe98f501207a8ced0f02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3814eb54eb53843977c0bbac98e7696f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bfcddcfca930b8afe6b922f5ef405e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cb39e78a749ba50a461796af1192162, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cce4f41d69e85e2dbc6b5bdeeffe89a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40f75baf8fd7ddcb07b9f17e65f6511f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42fb81f4f7a5b31966b420fcb2ae126c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/477005046c3d9c4ef716994365a3bcac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cb77b5e98d7771292b3130d075cf162, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d28d82123df9e4f75f85f43f96c7a66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50007c15bace3b18e86cc10ee9fed8e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5abcd1e3fb6291624ebd9c667c503ab0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7048d7754041df8fd1c213bf99436578, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/709673a8abbc13ea2d71b6121ef540c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78c4f08256b090e7be2bf015fb3c43a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c460577df2e9986ea7463616cfc955b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f1dfc9e1677ce7f5980206f9200187f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/803d253f6106b2b7dfee7b5f3e7b043b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84421f47862b21a76b816b0caa298fda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8704049520856fbd57b4ac8d4dd3e10b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d47ae1590e683025ef099df48357211, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91c406e95b615965c438021972b87407, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9997b4fb2bdf14b2dfcd6b71198233b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b7938d0bce9737deff8080333bdce5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4f56819acbcd5c237c4774a3abf626f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6249c8b4d7dfdde61819c2107729ada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae8e2c6c2363012e646c78f01e69b8f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af70887885c55592a8379703555d44b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5fc6343565edaba71c91fb86e303f8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b69682bad988d16c468b50906d96357e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b92cfaacdd6655a1d29fae3c6279503f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bde1f4369919057fc06411e603231589, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1b1e28b07f50cd55d4cd566425d8c67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c32dab40b54a775ba1bac9875d7a6208, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caac0973bb529c92837d0f79a0a9d7e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5f363a1f82978dee91d522dc9cf2e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d85a02b24153f014cd9de86e6aa7ae51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ded5fed98b8e35bafb1ccbab6b371209, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6babafa2c79294a361ef9f11c2e1378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6f9e9bee7a1d83d12526f0d80d89e3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e938b3903914043932ddc39775e4a036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed3fba47b0025fc3fac399ba72303b39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f22f386d8ba6b5ff77e5e2b961ee2147, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f95d9563238f289846b84909655c0934"

(Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) larvae produce a protein, P102, with a putative endoribonuclease-U domain. In previous works we have shown that P102 is involved in Lepidopteran immune response by forming amyloid fibrils, which catalyze and localize melanin deposition around non-self intruders during encapsulation, preventing harmful systemic spreading. Here we demonstrate that P102 belongs to a new class of proteins that, at least in Lepidoptera, has a diminished endoribonuclease-U activity probably due to the lack of two out of five catalytically essential residues. We show that the P102 homolog from Trichoplusia ni (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) displays catalytic site residues identical to P102, a residual endoribonuclease-U activity and the ability to form functional amyloids. On the basis of these results as well as sequence and structural analyses, we hypothesize that all the Lepidoptera endoribonuclease-U orthologs with catalytic site residues identical to P102 form a subfamily with similar function.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eb1c1cd448dabf9336fefb7a8a64edb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e85faeb302947d4e19419d08a92ab64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2da5ec9d3c9bfabb3974bc79f993604d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fe5905db70612e556f2e4b7dee5c781, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/588daa403060b9eb1b8b0f7d25fd09f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60e1eaf1650774d5092a1a44b3631d93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6169c4c06e008305aead9059d6360adf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a58210f09288581dcd5f04668c1348e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a7b5a833a82032960e8a745ff2fe972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c71e1a6ab868c42caba78ca9875f636, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/782786f0f6c84b377901f3713b88fac5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/883adb10290bd25ac9606367254b20cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90228dde08e7765f3cf503500d440958, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a71f9f305414cf9d9810da19eb98e8d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af2c1965bdd2600d1f11169f3cc13912, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7eee3cc94786c8f20c15899d1184577, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8e5decfca2631f4ce059807aca75c01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9e88237b3b3f3636366b400bd0a82fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf3b7555dbf7026e9b34811e3443ee09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0e9c1a9c28404b5a7cdcdcead82286a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d889f95c0b901d62a2f286fe7a23005b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddc8d542e55251af3be247d82cb95f2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3866b0b0c2be606016e21f5f7f1a23e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5f7fbf3744ce51dbe63993cef4c9b79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e976b48135dd0fde8334e320d1ec6b5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb652606e746fbf5df249ca2fe38890, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb48b9d53926a1a929c66b18fec8020a"

However, the basis for Treg cytokine expression in various compartments of the periodontium remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), with a view to understanding its role in this disease, and ultimately providing improved treatments. Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001). IL-35 protein and periodontal clinical indicators were negatively correlated. It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/033bd38769cf86e407e1c67dc366be07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/042c080f25290397500a864e7c426769, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c322a76f5cafaf2a54ef050e6475507, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e75401c43a05c38f3513d54625b9924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aa84f1d64b446555c8e0ca4568d2bf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e6374af9675fe88d315a0901c03c5b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32ca68aac46f6bc6e24b772222808507, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38e1d374bfe051ea75c8cd0701561e8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4996003b608cef67b4b28bad37dd2181, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/537377f7009bca5ad3019389252aba03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57f6f18cf7915045c4fc8d0dd5d4925d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5969a277962184b710099ee36ab23de3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ce62f6b8776bdfa1d6921da2d1b4b8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e67357d0c2c33fbf6b4d869598eccb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83347fa130759e1215db91ded63525a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86a47f8f38fff1cb1fa2ce808d5419f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c30075bc847e15a37c9125669bca7d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/976014a15450041490b901e6a1dc995f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0ab4782ec2601ff8f93ef61cd39be6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1db62afef8f04b42ec6eee8ca50c3f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a201630646cbd8e374e33bf1c17efc7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2e3bd5827617c5998f0773838cd88dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a544497f695011ff61037abe50df9482, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5661f1d6c5bb1b5ed8e71a4e67828bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad33f42923df806b84158cf3d21555e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b705a5155704e13d98f3cbf3dc358e55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9efb81326481c596a0991fb604eea61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baee4d076b3217daa8b37adfcc2d2e5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcd59a492d86bdff28184062722eb8cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1509fc543c6f320a92278d27f824adb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c229c92b55ef6382c29ba6081953bc04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c66fffedc950349a6c31d249dbdc8b82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6fc1a388918f1f29a5f88fb175f9728, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb31090920051e0f240f6ac88accbc5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4b272ce97ee0097ed549399b2155103, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e40d9ff550eb20a7a03c024032e47c3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e50fec973cac5a6294b2c1d84eaa2da9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8e7308ff15c5bf78c85bfc8d9f0a8b4"

The species became extinct 28,000years ago, coinciding with the arrival of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) in Europe 40,000years ago. There has been considerable debate surrounding the main causes of the extinction of Neandertals. After at least 200,000years of successful adaption to the climate, flora and fauna of Eurasia, it is not clear why they suddenly failed to survive. For many years, climate change or competition with anatomically modern human (AMH) have been the leading hypotheses. Recently these hypotheses have somewhat fallen out of favour due to the recognition that Neandertals were a highly developed species with complex social structure, culture and technical skills. Were AMHs lucky and survived some catastrophe that eradicated the Neandertals? It seems unlikely that this is the case considering the close timing of the arrival of AMHs and the disappearance of Neandertals. Perhaps the arrival of AMHs also brought additional new non-human microscopic inhabitants to the regions where Neandertals lived and these new inhabitants contributed to the disappearance of the species. We introduce a medical hypothesis that complements other recent explanations for the extinction of Neandertals. After the ancestors of Neandertals left Africa, their immune system adapted gradually to the pathogens in their new Eurasian environment. In contrast, AMHs continued to co-evolve with east African pathogens. More than 200,000years later, AMHs carried pathogens that would have been alien to pre-historic Europe. First contact between long separated populations can be devastating. Recent European and American history provides evidence for similar events, where introduction of viral, protozoan or bacterial pathogens to immunologically naïve populations lead to mass mortality and local population extinction. We propose that a virus, possibly from the family Herpesviridae, contributed to Neandertal extinction.",""

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

Since SARS showed a severe case fatality ratio, our concern is to know such a case fatality ratio as soon as possible after a similar outbreak begins. The epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS can be dealt with as the probabilistic growth curve models, and the parameter estimation procedure for the probabilistic growth curve models may similarly be treated as the lifetime analysis. Thus, we try to do the parameter estimation to the SARS cases for the infected cases, fatal cases, and cured cases here, as we usually do it in the lifetime analysis. Using the truncated data models to the infected and fatal cases with some censoring time, we may estimate the total (or final) numbers of the patients and deaths, and the case fatality ratio may be estimated by these two numbers. We may also estimate the case fatality ratio using the numbers of the patients and recoveries, but this estimate differs from that using the numbers of the patients and deaths, especially when the censoring time is located at early stages. To circumvent this inconsistency, we propose a mixed trunsored model, an extension of the trunsored model, which can use the data of the patients, deaths, and recoveries simultaneously. The estimate of the case fatality ratio and its confidence interval are easily obtained in a numerical sense. This paper mainly treats the case in Hong Kong. The estimated epidemiological determinants of spread of SARS, fitted to the infected, fatal, and cured cases in Hong Kong, could be the logistic distribution function among the logistic, log-normal, gamma, and Weibull models. Using the proposed method, it would be appropriate that the SARS case fatality ratio is roughly estimated to be 17% in Hong Kong. Worldwide, it is roughly estimated to be about 12–18%, if we consider the safety side without the Chinese case. Unlike the questionably small confidence intervals for the case fatality ratio using the truncated models, the case fatality ratio in the proposed model provides a reasonable confidence interval.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d0b27a4b192827dda15ba3a303f908b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32754d1912dd13069c1f6afbc289c72f"

Liposomal (LE) antibiotics allow low-frequency dosing and extended efficacy compared with standard (STD) formulations. We developed a novel sulfuric acid–loading method for doxycycline liposomes (LE-doxy). We hypothesized that a single s.c. injection of LE-doxy would be detectable in serum for at least 2 weeks at concentrations equal to or better than STD-doxy and would be bactericidal in an in vitro Mycobacterium smegmatis infection of J774A.1 macrophage cells. Liposomes were encapsulated by sulfuric acid gradient loading, and release kinetics were performed in vitro and in vivo. LE-doxy made using 8.25 mg/ml doxycycline loaded for 24 hours achieved 97.77% capture in 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 43.87% in sphingomyelin (sphing). Rats were injected s.c. with 50 mg/kg LE-doxy or 5 mg/kg STD-doxy, and serial blood samples were collected. Pharmacokinetics were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Liver and injection site skin samples were collected at euthanasia (4 weeks postinjection). Minimal histologic tissue reactions occurred after injection of STD (nonliposomal), DPPC, or sphing-doxy. DPPC-doxy had slightly faster in vitro leakage than sphing liposomes, although both were detectable at 264 hours. The mean residence time for DPPC was the highest (111.78 hours), followed by sphing (56.00 hours) and STD (6.86 hours). DPPC and sphing-doxy were detectable at 0.2 μg/ml in serum at 336 hours postadministration. LE-doxy was not toxic to J774A.1 cells in vitro and produced inhibition of viable Mycobacterium smegmatis at 24 and 48 hours. LE-doxy will require further testing in in vivo infection models.",""

The PEDV spike (S) protein contains two intracellular sorting motifs, YxxΦ (tyrosine-based motif YEVF or YEAF) and KVHVQ at the cytoplasmic tail, yet their functions have not been fully elucidated. Some Vero cell-adapted and/or attenuated PEDV variants contain ablations in these two motifs. We hypothesized that these motifs contribute to viral pathogenicity. By transiently expressing PEDV S proteins with mutations in the motifs, we confirmed that the motif KVHVQ is involved in retention of the S proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In addition, we showed that the YxxΦ motif triggers endocytosis of S proteins. These two motifs synergistically regulate the level of S expressed on the cell surface. To investigate their role in viral pathogenicity, we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing deletions or a mutation in the two motifs of the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A): (i) icΔ10aa (ΔYxxΦEKVHVQ), (ii) icΔ5aa (ΔKVHVQ), and (iii) icYA (Y1378A, to an inactivated motif, AEVF). Infection of Vero cells with icΔ10aa resulted in larger syncytia and more virions, with reduced numbers of S protein projections on the surface compared with icPC22A. Furthermore, we orally inoculated five groups of 5-day-old gnotobiotic piglets with the three mutants, icPC22A, or a mock treatment. Mutant icΔ10aa caused less severe diarrhea rate and significantly milder intestinal lesions than icPC22A, icΔ5aa, and icYA. These data suggest that the deletion of both motifs can reduce the virulence of PEDV in piglets. IMPORTANCE Many coronaviruses (CoVs) possess conserved motifs YxxΦ and/or KxHxx/KKxx in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. The KxHxx/KKxx motif has been identified as the ER retrieval signal, but the function of the YxxΦ motif in the intracellular sorting of CoV S proteins remains controversial. In this study, we showed that the YxxΦ of PEDV S protein is an endocytosis signal. Furthermore, using reverse genetics technology, we evaluated its role in PEDV pathogenicity in neonatal piglets. Our results explain one attenuation mechanism of Vero cell-adapted PEDV variants lacking functional YxxΦ and KVHVQ motifs. Knowledge from this study may aid in the design of efficacious live attenuated vaccines against PEDV, as well as other CoVs bearing the same motif in their S protein.",""

Its causative agent, Toxoplasma gondii, is a facultatively heteroxenous, polyxenous protozoon that has developed several potential routes of transmission within and between different host species. If first contracted during pregnancy, T. gondii may be transmitted vertically by tachyzoites that are passed to the foetus via the placenta. Horizontal transmission of T. gondii may involve three life-cycle stages, i.e. ingesting infectious oocysts from the environment or ingesting tissue cysts or tachyzoites which are contained in meat or primary offal (viscera) of many different animals. Transmission may also occur via tachyzoites contained in blood products, tissue transplants, or unpasteurised milk. However, it is not known which of these routes is more important epidemiologically. In the past, the consumption of raw or undercooked meat, in particular of pigs and sheep, has been regarded as a major route of transmission to humans. However, recent studies showed that the prevalence of T. gondii in meat-producing animals decreased considerably over the past 20 years in areas with intensive farm management. For example, in several countries of the European Union prevalences of T. gondii in fattening pigs are now <1%. Considering these data it is unlikely that pork is still a major source of infection for humans in these countries. However, it is likely that the major routes of transmission are different in human populations with differences in culture and eating habits. In the Americas, recent outbreaks of acute toxoplasmosis in humans have been associated with oocyst contamination of the environment. Therefore, future epidemiological studies on T. gondii infections should consider the role of oocysts as potential sources of infection for humans, and methods to monitor these are currently being developed. This review presents recent epidemiological data on T. gondii, hypotheses on the major routes of transmission to humans in different populations, and preventive measures that may reduce the risk of contracting a primary infection during pregnancy.",""

For the 5 European and 3 Asian regions that had been affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome, the pattern of reported precautionary action was broadly similar across the regions; ≈75% of respondents reported that they would avoid public transportation and 20%–30% would try to stay indoors. Some regional differences were noted; Europeans were more likely than Asians to avoid places of entertainment, and Asians were more likely to avoid seeing physicians.

We compared this to levels of HIV-1 RNA/DNA in urine and blood from the same subjects. Our results show that HIV-1 DNA, RNA and CD4 mRNA were detected in 8%, 19% and 31% respectively, of feces samples from infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load, and were not detected in any of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. In urine samples, HIV-1 DNA was detected in 24% of infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load and 23% of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequences of HIV-1 revealed distinct virus populations in concurrently collected serum, feces and urine samples from one subject.

This has led some investigators to hypothesize that such illnesses may also have disruptive effects on sleep. While several self-report studies suggest that viral illness may influence sleep parameters, no studies have assessed polysomnographically recorded sleep following viral infections. Design: Parallel control group comparison. Setting: Sleep laboratory in a large urban medical center. Participants: Twenty-one men and women with susceptibility to the rhinovirus type 23. Interventions: Nasal inoculation with rhinovirus type 23. Measurements: Polysomnographically recorded sleep for five nights (2300–0700 h) post-viral inoculation. Twice daily (1030 and 1430 h) performance assessment during each experimental day using auditory vigilance and divided attention tasks. A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed daily for the duration of the study. Results: In symptomatic individuals, total sleep time decreased an average of 23 min, consolidated sleep decreased an average of 36 min, and sleep efficiency was reduced by an average of 5% during the active viral period (experimental days/nights 3–5) compared with the incubation period. Psychomotor performance was impaired. These changes were significantly greater than those observed in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: The common cold can have detrimental effects on sleep and psychomotor performance in symptomatic individuals during the initial active phase of the illness.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17091fcc77b5ef24ea6dfbc03e248a3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ded906e4631a38ee8f4827325273b9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/225a81897723c19cebc6e2ff7dcb41f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22cb751eefb78ecb6d155d219b9201b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25490d506173fb1e49161ee1a345e9d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30e91796d034e930c8b265d6239ec372, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30eb75e666b13c7d41fe242690d1671a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43da69d187463c6086a9f5ab7f1d753d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/447176fd460fc2ef500708f1b3a36ea5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/473d1a81d57aa109243eb422c2a3fd4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/478c218d689dfff170dbb6de3b6d81da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f88dca0d0a5901510ef408796d9a770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3589c9f7e189dd1f3fa41cb194cfc72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b32818d497652d87d9fcc60d88f01e82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9558e4d0f83b083132479bd04ac2e1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb2eb8f91b5462dfa563258dde5486a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5dc19cc8aebd7e000dd380351511276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f527020c0ae63321ba6bad2f19b0b2db"

Humans are polymorphic for the germline dinucleotide variant, rs368234815-TT/ΔG, in the IFNL4 gene encoding interferon λ4. Since the IFNL4-ΔG allele has been linked to impaired viral clearance, we hypothesized that potential exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens, as assessed by the number of lifetime sexual partners, may increase prostate cancer risk in an IFNL4-ΔG-dependent manner. Accordingly, we find that men with 10 or more sexual partners and at least one copy of IFNL4-ΔG have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer while those with the same number of partners but lacking IFNL4-ΔG do not. Moreover, a test for effect modification shows a positive interaction between the number of lifetime partners and IFNL4-ΔG in the development of aggressive prostate cancer. Based on these findings, we conclude that a gene–environment interaction between IFNL4-ΔG and sexual activity may increase the risk of prostate cancer.",""

In this short review, we address several essential aspects of the etiology of KD with respect to the immune response to infectious stimuli: 1) the role of viral infections, 2) the role of bacterial infections and the superantigen hypothesis, 3) involvement of innate immune response including pathogens/microbe-associated molecular patterns and complement pathways, and 4) the influence of genetic background on the response to infectious stimuli. Based on the clinical and experimental evidence, we discuss the possibility that a wide range of microbes and viruses could cause KD through common and distinct immune processes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02408663e5fc385859059e7d4fe66cb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0473732f4d68ecef757365e6534ebe19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cbee960b4ad79add689763ee2de937e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24a3e3e371af0bf6098f117478e2bc1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e1ac0e1329a0e92882d638f697d9d1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a1f0cd588eba885cffe1bb4a07efe8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48418fc4adb76cbae1e6c8d066106691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f1332d8117dedecf1c77f7db5da219e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5762591c6c59d574f5113e15eb2ca8f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fd4146f825b5e2d010e3226314ae4cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/739e97441ef6806283d7e5fad747666b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/756fbb6e81b7b4b21f5112c4d7699770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a7c3bfa1ea143f1e3d370407f893eac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87b33fc3837b5e18067d19b27ca3f2a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1f6a169f265d88a4b632b45fdf03177, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b523318352017c1ddcc111fa1b138ff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbd32c750a8027d8fab928c9037201c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d3323395cfd25c4457b30591d7d89c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3a99586eb5ef1569e0e6fa51623a7a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce142867a27496ab8d036de156e1f301, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d457215bdc20eb1264e01990e32e5c6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f144fea007ee8440f001b173f96bf542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5a69038e0967f40a5365ff741d7dc0f"

Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines. Thus, our findings suggest a potential novel hypothesis involving dual infections for the adaptation of heterologous rotaviruses to new host species.",""

On various postinoculation or postchallenge days, virus-specific responses of systemic (blood and spleen) and intestinal (mesenteric lymph node and ileal lamina propria) mononuclear cells (MNC) were assessed by lymphoproliferative assays (LPA). After inoculation, 100% of group 1 pigs and 6% of group 2 pigs shed virus. Diarrhea occurred in 95, 12, and 13% of group 1, group 2, and control pigs, respectively. Only groups 1 and 2 developed virus-specific LPA responses prior to challenge. Group 1 developed significantly greater mean virus-specific LPA responses prior to challenge and showed no significant changes in tissue mean LPA responses postchallenge, and 100% were protected against virulent virus challenge. By comparison, both group 2 and controls had significantly lower LPA responses at challenge and both groups showed significant increases in mean LPA responses postchallenge. Eighty-one percent of group 2 and 100% of control pigs shed challenge virus, and both groups developed diarrhea that was similar in severity postchallenge. The virus-specific LPA responses of blood MNC mirrored those of intestinal MNC, albeit at a reduced level and only at early times postinoculation or postchallenge in all pigs. In a separate study evaluating antibody-secreting-cell responses of these pigs (L. Yuan, L.A. Ward, B.I. Rosen, T.L. To, and L.J. Saif, J. Virol. 70:3075-3083, 1996), we found that the magnitude of a tissue's LPA response positively correlated with the numbers of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells for that tissue, supporting the hypothesis that the LPA assesses T-helper-cell function. The magnitude of LPA responses in systemic and intestinal tissues also strongly correlated with the degree of protective immunity elicited by the inoculum (p = 0.81). We conclude that blood may provide a temporary %22window%22 for monitoring intestinal T cells and that the LPA can be used to assess protective immunity to human rotaviruses.",""

This animal breeds normally with no obvious defect in development. The IfitmDel animals exhibit a steady and significantly enhanced weight gain relative to wild-type controls beginning about three months of age and under normal feeding conditions. The increased weight corresponds with elevated fat mass, and in tolerance tests they are hyporesponsive to insulin but respond normally to glucose. Both young (4 mo) and older (12 mo) IfitmDel mice have enhanced levels of serum leptin suggesting a defect in leptin/leptin receptor signaling. Analysis of the gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus of IfitmDel animals, compared to WT, demonstrated an altered ratio of Pomc and Npy neuropeptide expression, which likely impairs the satiation response of the IfitmDel animal leading to an increased eating behavior. Also elevated in hypothalamus of IfitmDel mice were pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and reduced IL-10. Anatomical analysis of the hypothalamus using immunohistochemistry revealed that microglia exhibit an abnormal morphology in IfitmDel animals and respond abnormally to Poly:IC challenge. These abnormalities extend the phenotype of the IfitmDel mouse beyond abnormal responses to viral challenge to include a metabolic phenotype and weight gain. Further, this novel phenotype for the IfitmDel mouse could be related to abnormal neuropeptide production, inflammatory status and microglia status in the hypothalamus.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02082ba4a31add7226bc9701a7ac2635, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05a8f018b9faf611459cd3f2b156f84e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e61e70c5600b31dba77e42833411ef8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1791f8421ad54d4b4c1bf0fdd499020b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/196c9bd9dc9aed2298b2d947a9e67a74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ece94fd12a1207144d8362638ae7edb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2774cd3bd53b2a8b5f50a0d48faa282d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3268a93d8f8d862d9e0b17d1c830d827, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32be1643cdde6406f09b89755fe57a8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43a380ee35a8580a4cfcf7dfb92882fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43b456966669079b4cb8da3e933d8356, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dfab6016e2e1b709c9c6705599c97fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5372b732bea81c8d7fb8f64829bfb9ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/758ad88c25d4d30f56eb8bf4f2a7c656, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78a8c54ab35923a61fa81ec8b729307d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e45251810ce19348eabfbf10ad884d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82356474c251863bf66f9ea86a47daaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8499ffc4c7b8fabc5a94a4c65e86c50b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/920a3b911128c79197a0fd6364d91881, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95209e4c8e4512e850a7c3ee29e35545, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/992e40f14e1212d8cd67fe12fc839749, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d6da5ce45ce7795289e3c3c76d9c967, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ee8f827acf7f1dd3aa8ba2ca2c8f498, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f1935b8bd759cda4418a45de45e4b2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a383c7a86479ee711428851ec5163b97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3e30245e555442951968b8e7a90ccaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a80a7b5f4e7b2eb4d19689437df0a303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abee2378ea9149768003a2a5754d9c49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aded390eb18f6329e1dadfe99d1a16a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aefc39666b7289d2d7027c211e580fad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b70053207f0aa7b720120183727ff83b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c411a5b2e17dae14283163afe9557b57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfee528fca151a919b4436b972494562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f761d1f304a5cc66a1249a036959c703, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9b5255442608f0e7b5ee2e4e8ad8e85"

Virus structure, lifestyle, replication strategies, classication, the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations are focussed upon in the chapter. Viruses are extremely simple “life” forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential; the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal. A virus enters the host through any opportunistic opening of the body—; such as minute breaks in the skin barrier or mucosal linings of the eye, nose, etc. Antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity. An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree‥ The varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification are highlighted. Examples of naturally emerging viruses; such as Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile conclude the chapter. New technologies that allow the creation of manmade or “engineered” viruses, new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology are also presented. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind's greatest accomplishments yet many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions.",""

Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data. We take full advantage of the wealth of available protein structural and functional data to explore the evolution of the proteomic makeup of thousands of cells and viruses. Despite the extremely reduced nature of viral proteomes, we established an ancient origin of the “viral supergroup” and the existence of widespread episodes of horizontal transfer of genetic information. Viruses harboring different replicon types and infecting distantly related hosts shared many metabolic and informational protein structural domains of ancient origin that were also widespread in cellular proteomes. Phylogenomic analysis uncovered a universal tree of life and revealed that modern viruses reduced from multiple ancient cells that harbored segmented RNA genomes and coexisted with the ancestors of modern cells. The model for the origin and evolution of viruses and cells is backed by strong genomic and structural evidence and can be reconciled with existing models of viral evolution if one considers viruses to have originated from ancient cells and not from modern counterparts.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03045a65e0e16107a3561db6ca2bc54e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1416c0735331a0c8910ff349aa69c406, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17a05ad390f0ec06b5af540024a04b70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a9dc571f619b9a952ab27503936383a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2254df23b1e79b0089910b8b1dce50c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2479ad52e41c431c3e6c4d0612c9e99b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39c5368bfdd74bd8904458a8304ea6fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4db22c5be532999fecd2a0721d5a7be4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5510e71d42348365808a50019c6f1fad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dcdfead0d6ceb299aefc701a59098f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60bf0b8ec6bdea001720849a1e5ef406, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6206102780196d0d0dd88a19f34c6502, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7abdb641c426ba1224c082bc8706cca0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/888d80d0e632054bccf09002b26f1dbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88a7b11d8658bb59a77376efde185d2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/993576dc12409da0470c6dd13bfa6f56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ffd15d30910772086b44a3d88499983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2055ad4355713c26ad351e58406c5fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2b1f3dc5beb2b517811cf83c73da079, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db5b8c41ceacbe63db3ab57da7fa40c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e57fb6d6144856d1d58ef135199649bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e66ff5e665012b063d42826c316a8d62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8c592572665e1da77a17ac2f8dd7804, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb8b7ef3d1def36b5e55bdc9490c659c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef9dc4ffab16ff3397eded862adad68f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fedad1ebc5022bff2041891472810b14"

Alveolar Type II (TII) cells have immunomodulatory functions, but whether Type I (TI) cells, which comprise approximately 95% of the alveolar epithelium, also play a role in immunity is unknown. Because the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS. Alveolar TI cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat lungs that had been injured with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. PCR was performed to determine whether TI cells expressed transcripts for TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β at baseline and after lung injury. Immunocytochemical and protein analysis detected angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACE2, as well as angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Type 2 receptor (AT2R), in TI cells. To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response. Primary TI cells produce cytokines when treated with LPS, contain important components of the RAS, and can modulate LPS-induced cytokine production via the RAS, suggesting a role for TI cells in the innate immune response of the lung.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0114848cd55b8d8ef7cf3a02e3baee90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/031af08aba95114c1e30e51df7bd4a0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/038b33c016f68739819fbf6dfb881db6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0398d2b3593165ab77ab263a4f65dad5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05900a29230ba03df62f0f2e36dff9a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ba6aff5a8d9f4488b93c97bc51cd5bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/124f39b005b014916d37dfe04351f33f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/206ac5e1d8e45c77a8f38b6a0abee2d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2342615d39c2a2db137c16d45cfe6ed7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cb6acf857b26252cbbd97d46b242c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30ab85e03249c2a3393cd8d72c2593a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34d2c24412746701c950b12db3f805ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b225c8b11a636353daeb6595c5310fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/417067d2ed25ab4434f8865ce3634f51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42bac0e49ffabe6c1584b9be5ca477a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/471bc2b6e78caf01530d36a5d1c9836d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4824f01c35d99e45e300e41d41d612e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49138f6eed31bc0679fc96d26724918d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49f58f4c135288a7cd10cf81e096c0ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c187144bb88e767862434839bc14571, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54eee9c786fb0c1c4a8f1d1544b30391, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5534fc8bb652517c5fa98300ffde95f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e7efc2cc4d2baab3cd56da920d14745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7499ba23e2b06836e57c1de4580c287f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78968c7be39a93013c72fe5a58e82ca9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a431fb736b4a05a87e5cdf1c0c4f551, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cf0c0cd58139c0fa2265dd2457104a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d33f1c7e82144df2973cc5430abc865, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e788e109968267eebd2302dc508c0bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dd97b1e59ceb855738d892b157fdc1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90047992a3ac6fc98ce7dc331db7ef46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9122085f9799def833ea6da5ecac81e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b82cb05cb08e7958f2bd64554d981e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c2b4a78f438ee07d10908af5bc9c240, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dd34cb571be66a2737f6cdb268197d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3ebd4f2891a5f3f4586e2722c00065b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5c3c0ab53b8a587b9fd9ba48033bc50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a89e92c203cfa10ae679a02d77a145d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b518dcea14639b26e0d72ac33f688dfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ae4fd20d4c1ac59a31304b52a6bb9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b877f068e756112fe5a1a08e3d99538a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c2c2deb1c744aff2aaaf71eab557d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf978ccc272c6928adc5235f006be351, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4ee0fba1259356a863253b350c2eac7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb7d5cf668b1698f7f57c80f2b122bdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cebc1f14e05ffccd0d662a3729bf42ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dac7e7d4d8e9d382593ce35bd9dc20b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dee9b8ca0a9c010e74cd4f5b80e29f30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e02d6bd433d5871609d032ee0ddac9bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1bd90af80fa2086faa609f70af04bee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7051a19ba43345e4c1c18d97ed28e7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed755104e8c4d0ddea25043f325e7571, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f03427943a4334a295d85583bc4753bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f08a830f3be78811ae4fb238b3cc055c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdd4b1cc9b585dde8cebaed0c7cee13b"

Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signalling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of viral evasion mechanisms and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b11977cbbaf1be72cb2edfaa387c59d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e831eebf51f84893cbe0bde4cbc13fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3163f57c28c1aaa31fdcc317418a09cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d5eed7b5c821c3bf37a3a8895e02c70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ed10f5bd17530440809855612672c76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57cc82579b5a0228d4f0fda3fd9ab0db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bc9deae3ccd53629dd358ee43fc4b3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c7969dab68ef81afa9496e589c2be94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/843e8854f920c60c7e83550ba41cdada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98998b084e6fe906e551a40940f90c73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a43f19f1392d869b31dad718d99d9b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d945b9feb3f8259c43ff18053241b1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a72a9678384593e243a721aa02891448, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8d61c207b920a70eaf1cfff0a98c98f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a91fb12d63fb747c6f572cd3e7a513f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab8cf0b1095ba4b9731382c25acad421, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcd9c6816fb6276d5ec3bb7d945f796d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d024218ce11211df5d765f0fe26fbb39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3beafca905c1eeae1e701eec1ab6056, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4a5b1ac15faea8fbf8c78ec531a30f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbfe3ed4a26fb29d918a477431f77dd3"

The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) contains internal domains called fusion peptides (FP) that play essential roles in virus entry. Although membrane fusion has been broadly studied, there are still major gaps in the molecular details of lipid rearrangements in the bilayer during fusion peptide-membrane interactions. Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature. The significance of the ordering effect, membrane dehydration, changes in the curvature properties and the possible role of negatively charged phospholipids in helping to overcome the high kinetic barrier involved in the different stages of the SARS-CoV-mediated membrane fusion are discussed.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10a08f02485f33e2085a3d9bb1578a71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21bde3ca128b9c2db1569eb1673cdba9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26dfb45fc1fb27e4088f124748d92593, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a98652df8e4fd6b86b46245d0ef911f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/332d4ff4cc9d29ca7d1d15d71b505985, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b3475836474a57f4444d8d90be9ec62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49d1014c3bd0368b5da61702956d9c9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d53290f4a6254bb5f2a1c6d3b054c85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cfab953d304e6c8e47681300761fcd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e76642e336b682e4fd34c6227c5485c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68db1b24726ff8120f258ef485516459, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/726bb6bd8a5e1d971bd89edf1c0137af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7353b49a2d977dfe9de772b5ae9ece31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cd32e50b0fb0782bbeccf84cc32aa9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ce7640d8e51a6221548b582c8682bcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86f84505058e3614bab60c4db4bd2c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/921c06683f63beebd5dc1fac550467fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9719cb21f52b3ce759ef1d0fad3cfb0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a04af58f0951c235a0691a3bf859e228, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a114a8cc37c5d10e86965a950195bf1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/addc8a2e1d15266ac50a962b54922115, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1702af00b419bbd6c6d10ddd720ea42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b297ab9ae425753ec1e12f71e46d9883, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4c1b9b2819578d5168283a170ec2968, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c90ab7fd71656a8629ca4d8d6feb9b46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5940ed3aa5486c3398b2ec2a1f00efa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7441a1e3df6293694e57e0a66141f99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea196fb1efc299ed6b838ab6a7fcfc95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef1cc1991c363dda736b20a19703a6ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2e944b257531d81e427d2ce2e5bbcd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7893b38ec51d8a2ec70242e8da2a285, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7a9d4b71a947b22501fc0c0f076fa13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff65806cea08e7d10a6f16d0b052b1ee"

Study design Exploratory studies were conducted using spleens from septic patients and from mice with abdominal sepsis. Seven patients with sepsis after injury were identified retrospectively and compared with six injured patients. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, or to IP lipopolysaccharide. Control mice had sham laparotomy or injection of IP saline, respectively. A sepsis classification model was created and tested on blood samples from septic mice. Results Accuracy of sepsis prediction was obtained using cross-validation of gene expression data from 12 human spleen samples and from 16 mouse spleen samples. For blood studies, classifiers were constructed using data from a training data set of 26 microarrays. The error rate of the classifiers was estimated on seven de-identified microarrays, and then on a subsequent cross-validation for all 33 blood microarrays. Estimates of classification accuracy of sepsis in human spleen were 67.1%; in mouse spleen, 96%; and in mouse blood, 94.4% (all estimates were based on nested cross-validation). Lists of genes with substantial changes in expression between study and control groups were used to identify nine mouse common inflammatory response genes, six of which were mapped into a single pathway using contemporary pathway analysis tools. Conclusions Sepsis induces changes in mouse leukocyte gene expression that can be used to diagnose sepsis apart from systemic inflammation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e0252dc29e511a4aa8a00d90f77264b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42ebc1ed085665aa1f8cccc574aa1536, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c195eba7f5078d8a242b6b7efb24600, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e828807ee49b2f3cd5b74835d029fe7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690ac3566f58a6cfc052630733e32910, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7680d636de53980f621b9ec04a1ca4a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83a28084b4a3acf7fd03d056fd829894, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9809e1cddea7b5cb7c0d65adb454b0ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a69d62c1ebf53aa5f332973cf5b770e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b96ce0516f0884afe4a3efa7137ed1d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba52eb02f1962684546ecdda2711844c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf9a2c1f65527cf63da0a1a710f87a83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd66f255fbb9e7efb3619310fb00197a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df9932f74ff9a07fa6222824e6574813, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f076b188b13f094fc438d5c5bb8d780f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc45dd4f729962593faf9476d42a229b"

In this study we took a transcriptomic approach to gain insight into the response to viral infection of two strains of the Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) that differ in their resistance to Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV). Changes in gene expression in the hepatopancreas following infection with TSV and Yellow Head Virus (YHV) were assessed using a cDNA microarray containing 2469 putative unigenes. The null hypothesis tested was that significant differences between the transcriptomic responses to viral infection of resistant and sensitive strains would not be detected. This hypothesis was broadly rejected, with the most surprising observation being that the baseline (control, unchallenged) sensitive and resistant strains expressed distinguishable transcriptomic signatures. The resistant line was pre-disposed to lower expression of genes encoding viral (and host) proteins. Many of the genes differentiating resistant and sensitive lines are involved in protein metabolism, cellular trafficking, immune defense and stress response, although it was not possible to clearly identify candidate genes responsible for TSV resistance. In contrast to TSV challenge, YSV either failed to perturb the host transcriptome or created a “confused” response that was difficult to interpret.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12c071df064eb5e612c97864bbf8ca3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d3995922560536aaa50cd5354dcf30e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c595687c384b8fc31a1c8583f4b8ada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40a1a3bdb112fc056c62d563cfeb4622, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4733bce67ae94cad70dc8d38e5a39e8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a70f03f94fe0dffe3c399f8469ad779, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5553072a0f06fb4a73a28c0476da4a2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/774a6ccaac42e3856be4e386146c6062, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c0c562413fe0dfa73be2ef5b9f54de8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d02c211a5048e91cd86e0f1ff9001cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e483a0ef18df88ec0ed114cf66b67f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e8ec7904108f75973f5965c2e1d55fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f4e7c8f805a9f1baf38030c03827008, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a14e6e761d7dd0e8633551a09a608a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a50f8e91bbab7dbb159d181290d5273a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aabab6a139cd0b350238468c9d5cbbc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1bb9dbe92e6feb6bd8c506775092598, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b43668c466f64d3810ca4918839a9dbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bedd3b85ce4385f878f40d7184a67db1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca5eff26a2d04acc97279ffe69992e42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e75893cf908cdf1b575f88083248f53f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb3ef79b896210f3598d34309cf433d6"

However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017–2018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score > 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10–17). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: IV zanamivir could be a good therapeutic option in patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who are unable to take oral or aerosolised antiviral medication. We recommend prospective randomized control trials to support this hypothesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00b667773344a053194a661c644001ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/078d9e2494196394f93350bff4fcfda1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1169e1736072dd32093f8b7f4a86de90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/176b93232fb55f56f502b5756d7c103f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1812469bb7d920e55141b4d592007d99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19d3f246725fafeb9c628a591222107b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cd4a663c36bb0188c455508131fe8e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35598ee53506403d24f8b4c897552dbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b1fb815afa7a442c44b8eca161943d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/407f07166d747c0742f34d7495c633bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46e071310ad659ca998d1df60bb95c3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/489784cb214a45ca3c093ed4919d6404, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51a9caafb1c786ea9a59af21ffcdd732, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58fcb5f2ca132fe6ebf2a3a9605285c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ad2ee4083c4dc51010cfc48a988d0a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6976c16d99dfe9315b507c13684c9198, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70315b2bb061e8cd26721dfbb4d0c8d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73ddea1d4c14223d11561aff44feba2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a26690ec4134b437dbdbf79b125f6a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e5817168e6054d8687c83091ca90d1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/865ddba2e27bc42efb5eaba4485ce1f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/933c7931df2312540e166a3d3c70748f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/964a7566f824de975408e77a32dc47cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9907aafcba6a1344bf87e70337b3f4ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bec495f1bd770683d4807f091b8a524, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cab0be41c6efdaa7087bfa22880747c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f7865eba1feebd46d5b09d79af7bbd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a93639a61289ef288122da38928b873c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa443db41753af5f651d398965d02090, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad351a9f882564203c5a9554201184d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3839ccf69d9c246752f3ed630c469ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6a361d54a62e7c1696939a99e1269a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd26a354f39bdfb593889c5ca25d4ff7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6dd711cdbd6ab794a001e2beb04249d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d022b17d77f892980bfee7f9e3265611, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d909f3ec9950445bf19acab6639fee4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d93e71daa4629ecb5f4b8778a79bae8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db8a7e6e847e69ad8f6eaff0eb9e9b7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9c7fd80464aad800be4d108cefa03f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f39f1ff20a8270cc2f402ed16e29141c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f432248688baac80dde499113d300026, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcfcd9981ac16d078e4c94a985f6c7a5"

This article constitutes a risk-based review aimed at supporting an etiologic scenario of selected, sporadic, protein-associated, i.e., conformational, neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), and their vascular- and metabolic-associated ailments. Methods: A rationale is adopted, to incorporate selected clinical data and results from animal-model research, complementing epidemiologic evidences reported in two prior articles. Findings: Theory is formulated assuming an underlying conformational transmission mechanism, mediated either by horizontal transfer of mammalian genes coding for specific aggregation-prone proteins, or by xeno-templating between bacterial and host proteins. We build a few population-based and experimentally-testable hypotheses focusing on: (1) non-disposable surgical instruments for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) and other rapid progressive neurodegenerative dementia (sRPNDd), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and motor neuron disease (MND); and (2) specific bacterial infections such as B. pertussis and E. coli for all forms, but particularly for late-life sporadic conformational, NDDs, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and atherosclerosis where natural protein fibrils present in such organisms as a result of adaptation to the human host induce prion-like mechanisms.

We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces “holes” in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens. The deficiency may be the result of random elimination of PRRSV-specific T cells or the generation of T cells that accept PRRSV epitopes as self-antigens. Loss of helper T cells for virus neutralizing (VN) epitopes can result in the failure of selection for B cells in lymph node germinal centers capable of producing high affinity VN antibodies. Generation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells may also be impaired. Similar to infections with LDV, LCMV, MCMV, HIV-1 and trypanosomes, the host responds to the deficiency of pathogen-specific T cells and perhaps regulatory T cells, by “last ditch” polyclonal B cell activation. In colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets, this results in hypergammaglobulinemia, which we believe to be a “red herring” that detracts attention from the thymic atrophy story, but leads to our second independent hypothesis. Since hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets, we hypothesize that this is due to the down-regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG and cytokines in porcine colostrum, especially TGFβ which stimulates development of regulatory T cells (Tregs).","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0317a07443041799b326d23eb8bac26d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d8c0fcdd016f27cc111d083b57f7d61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1010163d30623b9971709c34722b6234, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14fee1f86875f994c80b102fa1cffb23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bd935448d7b826cc2b61354580211ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/258ec14cfba5a2a6b90f7df7cdb6a5f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/315d17b51e3cc378ffdef6059513d999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fccb8779c9b85d59cf83653039e49b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4950482e3027eb3ae604a0ca805bef70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d3daf20a7b08d0035f0b8b4a587dbfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5128b62f7a3581dc0d935264c89efffa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51848e86626d3352a863b21c518bf6b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b93f34902cd181e60f5bbcea838b50d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fd0a3f51b7526350d51027506521085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7268ccea0806f837d98d004999f62b69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72ed382f88579f0a4a93c5e6685d48d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/762230f15d30a7901d01569dcfc4b86f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ede34bdef8b4a01a5f60341cd3be1da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81dd8353305a2947b532e2b8d19f5970, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82c264d30e381fed09408c01127f908d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82c91612d9e90a53e1337b96a102c721, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/885c930a8e244fd164d349d5c5a938df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89741c855426e5dea299bddef2b8ebc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c45566a983a262ccb614dd50d5420ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9730d66bf3d78b5c6787f3f871bc2ff4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a3e2f3c6c08cb1687332fe5dc147fde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b48242ec16520fef0af7e47be083435, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dd493150962d3f11333c3791184b8fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e6fe0c5b8ada3129c1167ca2ebdd7ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a769b8b10b72cefa01c7401c63e6c32b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa426796601aec4b6a938c29f5277a85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab55a8df0716acb24ce77f3cafe983c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4ec8d3b42e902a4a9b0182cdd483fe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7913854de94ef58cb9cb4ba85cc7eb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4e7bf89c2ca68973868664dc33cc293, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3a842e9b8718238848b0c74892ba4bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e28e2bb260872f89143d518845cd3ee4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e67684e90fbeaa1b9a80f722db4a6bc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb9f4c3d2a1eb02f7ba7769443b8f942, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4652651082d2c044635c79b42f1013d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5da276710632c467745fffa1babcd7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d5459843c90af91f2531efd7040bfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcb6e37fdb0330226d06b634bddd1b14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff1a2189dc3b2fd77b7481e7839212a7"

Because IL-17A and IL-17F, ligands for IL-17 receptor antagonist (IL-17RA), have been shown to mediate neutrophil migration into the lung in response to LPS or Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia, we hypothesized that IL-17RA signaling was critical for acute lung injury in response to pulmonary influenza infection. IL-17RA was critical for weight loss and both neutrophil migration and increases in tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) after influenza infection. However, IL-17RA was dispensable for the recruitment of CD8(+) T cells specific for influenza hemagglutinin or nucleocapsid protein. Consistent with this, IL-17RA was not required for viral clearance. However, in the setting of influenza infection, IL-17RA(−/−) mice showed significantly reduced levels of oxidized phospholipids, which have previously been shown to be an important mediator in several models of acute lung injury, including influenza infection and gastric acid aspiration.

Infection of normal resting B cells with EBV results in activation to lymphoblasts that are phenotypically similar to those generated by physiological stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4. One important difference is that infection leads to the establishment of permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas CD40L/IL-4 blasts have finite proliferation lifespans. To identify early events which might later determine why EBV infected blasts go on to establish transformed cell lines, we performed global transcriptome analyses on resting B cells and on EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts after 7 days culture. As anticipated there was considerable overlap in the transcriptomes of the two types of lymphoblasts when compared to the original resting B cells, reflecting common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Of interest to us was a subset of 255 genes that were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Genes which were more highly expressed in EBV blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for a set of interferon-stimulated genes which on further in silico analyses were found to be repressed by IL-4 in other cell contexts and to be up-regulated in micro-dissected malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma biopsies when compared to their normal germinal center cell counterparts. We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes. This was supported experimentally in our B cell model where IL-4 stimulation partially reversed transcriptional changes which follow EBV infection and it impaired the efficiency of EBV-induced B cell transformation. Taken together, these data suggest that the discordant regulation of interferon and IL-4 pathway genes by EBV that occurs early following infection of B cells has relevance to the development or maintenance of an EBV-associated malignancy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003a6585158aef540f04e55911b58755, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/105e7cfb76c9249dfff0a3aba1c8e485, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16e13cef894934673190cbb4356a2a78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a7e45ef4120dfb2ad3fc2cb8ce962ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/276f9205d777c1e8be347b8e54ab4bfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d9822e78d6c39d80b3ae25e9b9e480a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e8e8b1f253b6d6883d4c9ee1632f18e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ffbab5e547757c8af4e0aa978b2da48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43b89562f6e7c351e388a75d9e296817, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/464277ee32ca3a535bc0b9a50acdaba3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4678a853921dd5dbbea0b90fde04be64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dfa82cc68212954595dc96edc2fd89d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58946e7c7d8a86dd0453d0f63032aab7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c16e54b1045c49446fe34ada28472b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fc047c76b238ee54fe8e6814e36542b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fdacf48259e65225caaacc79d4e06f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62f01bbc9afed7758925ce2fa2f69b50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73608dba6763c0d11024044932214d29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c6edfe40230a91a34fc534e19401e2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ea9c1098a33bbb4e984f4c3668fe5e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/802214d4873e7397fe3b1041437080b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80b2d325a6703c1bcead5efecad8625b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/856306ae7a1b9464683e73e656635817, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85bcfc23629f396d45f8093f166e0270, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85ddb0743c4505a051b1c83c3ebb4880, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86305853f978a2d73ac388b6b4fe19eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/895bd114e0e55e4ec051e37b61484079, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f49ca75e5dd95eeecb4532bbdeef32b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90a630ec355455d32201c9f30aa9771f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9664ec76c6ce9ca7a9bfc7c716d4f7dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97d5938365b94a500174a765a857e08e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a44c8c9ab6c8e4ccea74b3ef0dee2ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c497953d4191fbc8d1ae72aabed161d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a07317836765be4520537614d27ba1d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1412b3a8f961ba42553b8e2ce6e1d57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adf8ca6638e4f855154b151e7fed61ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b39208cadfad639cc8c3ce235713a076, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/beb8806b066926319533eb15529fdb35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0b5374ed80d844d3635f30bd2ddb746, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3559da4790a40f562bb17c026aeb2d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c778a2df2e65003d4c3e0b6d60b8fdc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d12c74b4d56ae308a759de337ce6548d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d661ca46a6a857a396c8e0ae7ea87e9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da38cff09007a7b0ddec5c43c5e5b6e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfeb0a377f08e35639a923e5992174b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e30b936460f94dc95497a4965107900f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e37a65cb97e51a259e68da5f3a6b934a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3a5d2e28dd4af54da1a0da2f02a27cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e58ed1e68180c20dcdefa9ff8de473f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7dc8248ab9684fc5d286154839bc9dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee85dd67ce6414106ce469e8729b8398, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f029efc99f04d3dcf7c0fa0ad62f5ffa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f899af2fe7a96d0be3323112c8b359d5"

PRF efficiency can vary enormously between different stimulatory structures, but the features that lead to efficient PRF stimulation remain uncertain. To address this question, we studied the structural dynamics of the frameshift signal from West Nile virus (WNV), which stimulates −1 PRF at very high levels and has been proposed to form several different structures, including mutually incompatible pseudoknots and a double hairpin. Using optical tweezers to apply tension to single mRNA molecules, mimicking the tension applied by the ribosome during PRF, we found that the WNV frameshift signal formed an unusually large number of different metastable structures, including all of those previously proposed. From force-extension curve measurements, we mapped 2 mutually exclusive pathways for the folding, each encompassing multiple intermediates. We identified the intermediates in each pathway from length changes and the effects of antisense oligomers blocking formation of specific contacts. Intriguingly, the number of transitions between the different conformers of the WNV frameshift signal was maximal in the range of forces applied by the ribosome during −1 PRF. Furthermore, the occupancy of the pseudoknotted conformations was far too low for static pseudoknots to account for the high levels of −1 PRF. These results support the hypothesis that conformational heterogeneity plays a key role in frameshifting and suggest that transitions between different conformers under tension are linked to efficient PRF stimulation.",""

Since proteins aggregate to perform function, and since protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks model these aggregations, one would expect to uncover new biology from PPI network topology. Hence, using PPI networks to predict protein function and role of protein pathways in disease has received attention. A debate remains open about whether network properties of “biologically central (BC)” genes (i.e., their protein products), such as those involved in aging, cancer, infectious diseases, or signaling and drug-targeted pathways, exhibit some topological centrality compared to the rest of the proteins in the human PPI network. To help resolve this debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its “spine” that connects all other network parts and can thus pass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08025982d387439780a3fae694fb6b04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0beb2264799de5f67f6cea0379bdee5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e90b56d30ca00c418f30b419419da5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1574c9a7fbaef96428cb4d62e7c0153f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a99c1fdf2ceab252f17c2e756278eef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79b9cb77e39dde72ee98ddd248cdac41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a0cd666199fa418f49d216fb7f7f6e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/814ecf30cb25ee49cac66337c4d568ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81a17741dd926654e9a1417de1b15241, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e063028bb1f64cf60cecabec87b584a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfa3e2413930b1957a4bd360eb037303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3d666ecdb072050069c22b550cf57a4"

Many of these factors are released into exosomes, which are small membranous vesicles that participate in cell–cell communication. Exosomes from MSCs are thought to have similar functions to MSCs such as repairing and regeneration of damaged tissue, but little is known about the immunomodulatory effect of these vesicles. Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets. According to this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes (exo-hASCs) on in vitro stimulated T cells. The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helper T cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN-γ production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN-γ release on in vitro stimulated cells. In summary, here we demonstrate that MSCs-derived exosomes are a cell-derived product that could be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0247c3ed491164438a103528e6f5b960, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0abdbd8ad2ef794c5124a94a6f80a5e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d3651412baa6c214e464a11c48f37bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17687e0c7dad438406486c8528783524, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ea55c3ae1cbc37950c287b4337e53ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/224d3c4279baa45e816c06f19db99b29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/276c432b858484388fb9242a07b46069, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b0ff3657d311f4104a1acb32b91124b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fb8f5d4ce6d8e07ce5e928a1860a9f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42b16e8caebcf58c9ad410bb5e40d82f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4642907a6cc87d8ecf11957d72d7c1d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d1b8ce8725bf8f46e0fbc59de36ffe9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50c2fe478a38f51df6680cc38054aa59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6729c2f5fccc4f8042f7085233cf30d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6accb75951d26779945fd4d1eaaa42e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f591f9edd772b21c71d5db398aa1fd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85c7e7e593698777455344aca5451855, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/901d4ae0b88fd4defe64e2ccb9449385, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95f89d19dddca142fe5917c9b28f2ad8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1428d7a1cfe137140af5df45ef992e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a98df51551a367a56eb590f3a189a346, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa888b5437ade5e3105efca0ddce16e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3f3b9e926b7fbc2ad45149c53c10396, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b863b09a810391bc613a427a48a31deb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbe8cb00ae8e0a13a92c3b8ef2af99d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c025b3f6963c143facd084c6f75ca709, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd9e6f208458a75cbd13fadad1a49917, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6163ee54bf68d940c509ed5d0167ad6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8bca153893d2195f5f0ee02daeef48b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea59e33bba78a6158d1ecf548d819548, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f70c9de9f83a803b49df0d08d680e77b"

We sought to further investigate the relationship between WU and KI infection and respiratory disease in a pediatric population with respiratory symptoms in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms in a Singaporean pediatrics hospital. Upon consent, residual respiratory samples from pediatric inpatients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were collected and further screened for WU and KI using qPCR. The amplicons of positive samples were sequenced for confirmation. The severity of a patient's illness was assessed by chart review post-discharge looking for clinical markers of respiratory status such as presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and interventions. Results: From December 2016 to April 2017, 201 patients with residual respiratory samples were enrolled in the study. The average age of all participants recruited was 45 months. WU and KI were detected in 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) of patients, respectively. Conducting bivariate and multivariate modeling, patients with WU or KI positivity were not at increased risk of SARI, need for additional oxygen, intravenous fluids, and did not receive additional oral antibiotics or bronchodilators during admission. In contrast, patients with RSV detections were at increased risk of requiring supplemental oxygen during hospital admission. Conclusion: While limited in sample size, our pilot study data do not support the hypothesis that molecular evidence of WU or KI was associated with increased morbidity among a sample of general, pediatric patients with respiratory illness in Singapore.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d2f4dff35bab09618e37f5f3a13b2a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/139f3fffd7ce0bf5c0463776b9eb11b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dff81796793a7ce6cc908c48ad9bdb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35b6374f0b6e4bb5465dfe6f76d86016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3979704c4956ad8fb23e816d43a4d398, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43eaf32de02bfb1ce8a5e748427bddb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d77210dba841110531a61945e1c236a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f163c64bb5f13185afb6ebbf26ebafc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9b8198fe9a831062454ad76803b5c5e"

There is growing evidence that the Camelus dromedarius is host species for the virus and plays an important role of a source of human infection. Along these lines, the authors decided to detect coronaviruses in dromedary camels in two high-risk areas of Iran by employing an reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. In the present study, nasal swab specimens were collected from 98 camels (C. dromedarius) traditionally reared in southeast and northwest of Iran. The detection of pancoronavirus was carried out, using RT-PCR. Pancoronavirus RNA was observed in seven cases among 98 nasal swab samples. Among these, 4 positive samples belonged to Azerbaijan province located in northwest of Iran and 3 positive samples were taken from southeast of Iran. The results of this study contribute to raising the hypothesis to the extent of transmission and risk factors for human infection and public health in Iran.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0730d777eae11626b8db3ec7b5ae1bcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10111607cb787494d89277044290fb17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28a174c392420dc4ddf8c60383520ba0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40c03b6c3f54fecc21984dbc1b9ea2dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50802fcd0d045f7db62620c61a0926a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6283c7a22dd62285a7990e3d4893c2c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7855aa634c07071e4c7a570973bc6565, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/954b894dbd6aabd3f75341ce5975c8d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a43f0ecfd060fd0e889191d7d3ddb2f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a949477153ec9779d51cffbe63b25ee1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c60c11c60ba5e8b4c9af64ad878993b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbbaec94db309375b4ed3b35d8560628, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b19cead75ebb54034528208934e174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d743cb49ce7a8817585b1a3cfe034747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df2c91a1a663113c289358036286f352, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4da2ebdc84c8a81c22c6f866a68fcd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e52735df56c8d3ed4be83831adf0f499, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee5a99ef7b4d4ec11ea6022ac52435b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f00df314e93f9278a305edc288f868c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0a028b379dcae492d944e224fa18297, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb155de7e1a3d4bd1fa696bd9d2824eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc655bb8bfde99b03270104dbbb78bca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffa607e13af85bb6388c4b981eab808e"

The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Seba’s short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.

These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the “bag-of-words” model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the “bag-of-words” approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of “bag-of-words” methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative ‘degenerate’ K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A.

While local infection often remains asymptomatic, severe or even fatal diseases occur when streptococci become invasive and spread to different sites in the infected host. We have established porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures (ALI) from the porcine lung to analyze the interaction of streptococci with their primary target cells. As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells. We hypothesize that soluble effectors such as suilysin are present at higher concentrations in cells kept at ALI conditions and thus more effective. These results should be relevant also for infection of the respiratory tract by other respiratory pathogens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06116fbb14af9d82501e01311daea479, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ad96763a67a936c6c0aabc5796dace0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18cc661074f3c45f1ac6cd867e3c7571, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d641e1fc25f9cd66535c3724463932b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21e92a1a1a3450f93e547a80601862af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24cee2d55fae12d5a24d4a58da16f7ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25481e33d6047450c12cc0de02ac29e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2958672cae011a486276485479ae2511, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30fdd148bc14b475f9303bf2871aa782, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/380575b478a5993598a1ac57c244ed58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c1823afb337647b9028e322644df51f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45a2b3c76e232b82506d18b14a297873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d1c54823df4af27d28454bdbce4df79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dd454b02c78b5f509ff1b649ae4615d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c7449aaabc85bfe5b3b50a74f809fc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72ff3ccbf14ad795771cee34e2e911d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7610ba9f3c7a8370e6fa438b8e0e039b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cad4663aa01518f9e5d63ea6df3efd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ec89afb43fcf7b823055ee5191dd45a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80306b197dac6aaf8fe9b4a151042329, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82e7210bc50f1242cad14620aa377d26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9912995aea84ffb0f8b634c4b90462d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99b8ea731130dd09fd5e1475ccd77fcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccfa47e355b9b9982b8a0aab788681ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdae7e61ce6624f801552a4176d140dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d024e3eac242c515f82bebed3665b9f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d07dcfa97fa138eecff9068eac40256e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1dfe8bbeedd41f54f2b647eeb89b6e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd2a321677e9a1d49044322f154e2f09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6abfc6db242ca0206bb0251661e86c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f86b85eb73b0b2c68233f269932fbb66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f94ca649f0c4d6ef07842ac07921e433, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/feb23a829b383b3c67b54eb2d619ae15"

The small sample and limited genomic characterizations have prevented further analyses so far. Here, we tested 2,087 fecal specimens from 11 bat species sampled in Ghana for HCoV-229E-related viruses by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Only hipposiderid bats tested positive. To compare the genetic diversity of bat viruses and HCoV-229E, we tested historical isolates and diagnostic specimens sampled globally over 10 years. Bat viruses were 5- and 6-fold more diversified than HCoV-229E in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and spike genes. In phylogenetic analyses, HCoV-229E strains were monophyletic and not intermixed with animal viruses. Bat viruses formed three large clades in close and more distant sister relationships. A recently described 229E-related alpaca virus occupied an intermediate phylogenetic position between bat and human viruses. According to taxonomic criteria, human, alpaca, and bat viruses form a single CoV species showing evidence for multiple recombination events. HCoV-229E and the alpaca virus showed a major deletion in the spike S1 region compared to all bat viruses. Analyses of four full genomes from 229E-related bat CoVs revealed an eighth open reading frame (ORF8) located at the genomic 3′ end. ORF8 also existed in the 229E-related alpaca virus. Reanalysis of HCoV-229E sequences showed a conserved transcription regulatory sequence preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. These data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E. IMPORTANCE The ancestral origins of major human coronaviruses (HCoVs) likely involve bat hosts. Here, we provide conclusive genetic evidence for an evolutionary origin of the common cold virus HCoV-229E in hipposiderid bats by analyzing a large sample of African bats and characterizing several bat viruses on a full-genome level. Our evolutionary analyses show that animal and human viruses are genetically closely related, can exchange genetic material, and form a single viral species. We show that the putative host switches leading to the formation of HCoV-229E were accompanied by major genomic changes, including deletions in the viral spike glycoprotein gene and loss of an open reading frame. We reanalyze a previously described genetically related alpaca virus and discuss the role of camelids as potential intermediate hosts between bat and human viruses. The evolutionary history of HCoV-229E likely shares important characteristics with that of the recently emerged highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.",""

Despite the existence of different platforms and devices for the pulmonary administration of drugs, only a few formulations are marketed, partly due to physiological and technological limitations. Respiratory infections represent a significant burden to health systems worldwide mainly due to intrahospital infections that more easily affect immune-compromised patients. Moreover, tuberculosis (TB) is an endemic infectious disease in many developing nations and it has resurged in the developed world associated with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic. Currently, medicine faces the specter of antibiotic resistance. Besides the development of new anti-infectious drugs, the development of innovative and more efficient delivery systems for drugs that went off patent appears as a promising strategy pursued by the pharmaceutical industry to improve the therapeutic outcomes and to prolong the utilities of their intellectual property portfolio. In this context, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) emerged as a promising approach to circumvent the limitations of conventional formulations and to treat drug resistance, opening the hypothesis for new developments in this area.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1802aa4ec86cb05b8f446fbbf05cf5ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3863ac2d1481158d0c169a883613e4fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e021a590f504d934b0f0183a48050fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/627c78ea9c5fd98f02a3ac4d5ab79d23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/723dc78e4068858337ed9f9568477fa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/851243d31df857f14813dde861ab7bb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d000aca0a654a8b1200b96271f7af96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91dc5a8a38b9a7459383b3ba81c42e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96d6f020a6f085bab814491e709ecc0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c235b551b8e4b7e684876be7947753d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ed11b5ab371c6b08262d6c7496f9572, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2a54a9ff0a9ccae660ea7dbe34ddeb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0a4c1ffb890a08cbb51949b2a302daa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9d672d0f5c85827c61f31930a2e1972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcad3202aca2999b853f740208eefb72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1a7194689d0364bf9dc4cbd14a28ca9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2013647e71891d70bd6a79f5d0480d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c94ad6f30f04f42b90b46bdb944e627a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf7c66531c6b49ead754bc4cd80cd8ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc5fefefa26247021e3b24ed05ddb649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3ace35dc5eca57fdc57d562ad8ad153, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb05a041ab89c85d22cd995fb5984fe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f64248de8df462539174e05dd81ab2a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa87f198ce754d5f7f8aaa760745121d"

The role of one such variable, population density, in the spread of influenza is controversial. Prior studies have tested for such a role using arbitrary thresholds for population density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher or lower mortality. The results of such studies are mixed. The objective of this study is to estimate, rather than assume, a threshold level of population density that separates low-density regions from high-density regions on the basis of population loss during an influenza pandemic. We study the case of the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 in India, where over 15 million people died in the short span of less than one year. METHODS: Using data from six censuses for 199 districts of India (n=1194), the country with the largest number of deaths from the influenza of 1918–19, we use a sample-splitting method embedded within a population growth model that explicitly quantifies population loss from the pandemic to estimate a threshold level of population density that separates low-density districts from high-density districts. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a threshold level of population density of 175 people per square mile. A concurrent finding is that districts on the low side of the threshold experienced rates of population loss (3.72%) that were lower than districts on the high side of the threshold (4.69%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper introduces a useful analytic tool to the health geographic literature. It illustrates an application of the tool to demonstrate that it can be useful for pandemic awareness and preparedness efforts. Specifically, it estimates a level of population density above which policies to socially distance, redistribute or quarantine populations are likely to be more effective than they are for areas with population densities that lie below the threshold.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/164426c0583380434b1b276e8ac76e60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3afc2ad6e85b64c556ca719d80a8e02e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b834c78834923f2229e9ba90fac7955, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40740ad6374514c3b2eb74ee46dd3556, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40cb95a2c6fc11d81e8006da49acc87a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45aa903139c382b13049a6a2745c60ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e83ec410cca3e4aba3aa82553cd4a9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bb0fe2be7d8f9af2859562608cf1c4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8f35041d7d113b694f50dc39850303c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae2f4684900ee0c52545b6c3dafc5b97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b873feedf8432c8de6f0dfa98ee5c40f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8dfb7cb495b2db5ef935e6036ada64e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3ebdcc77816117dd6490c833710bb14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee49e9afb2899ed9565cd622aceda639, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1c1483a0bc6a240505239dbf3f9ba9d"

It has been proposed that macrophages play a major role as effector cells in this process. We report that cultured dog brain cells contain a population of macrophages capable of producing reactive oxygen species as measured by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. In cultures infected with canine distemper virus, a burst of reactive oxygen is triggered by antiviral antibody. This response depends on the presence of viral antigens on the surfaces of infected cells and is mediated by the interaction of antigen-bound antibody with Fc receptors on the macrophages. Since there is no evidence in vitro or in vivo that oligodendrocytes, the cells forming myelin, are infected, our observation supports the hypothesis that %22innocent bystander killing%22 is important in demyelination caused by canine distemper virus.

In vitro, sarcoid derived fibroblasts are invasive and express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -2 and -9. It was hypothesised that the MMPs produced by neoplastic cells play a role in both their local invasiveness and interaction with the overlying epidermis (picket fence formation). The objective of this morphological study was to investigate the local behaviour and in situ MMP expression pattern in sarcoids of different clinical types. A total of 43 surgically excised sarcoids were examined by histology, immunohistology for the expression of MMP-1, -2 and -9, and transmission electron microscopy. Regardless of the clinical type, sarcoids showed local invasion of the dermis and damage to the basement membrane in areas of interaction with the epidermis.

Our study of genetic homozygosity degree includes an analysis of the presence, distribution and individual combination of 20 to 30 selected genetically controlled morphophysiological traits in the sample of BEN patients and in the control-healthy group. Assuming that BEN is genetically controlled disease, we made a hypothesis that an increased homozygosity level, as well as the changed variability among the patients, could be populationgenetic parameter for the prediction of the illness. Taking into consideration our experience, as well as the experience of numerous scientists who studied the nature of the inheritance of mono-and oligo-genically controlled qualitative traits, we applied a methodology to estimate the proportion of such homozygously recessive characters (HRC-test). This population-genetic study did not only show statistically significant difference of the mean values of genetic homozygosity (BEN: 8.7 ± 0.3; control: 7.6 ± 0.3), but of the differences in the type of distribution too, as well as the differences in the presence of certain individual combinations of such traits.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05b9965f67f5b8232d8b60a86bd88212, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05caace55fb8372483f0c6d0a9f986c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dceab00cd0508ba8282c48b2a9a046b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3676dcfd9a976acc57c86084777dcf55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3825cdd6200710e76fdb98938a253a15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4077b906d8f23681aca5ef2de9c9d01b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e7420bfa09d2a38406d6fcfb33e2cec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5164a01a6e16910b69f9f0800afcd60a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54532ad9a09c478bada8b896d08c6583, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ad0e9203b009dfa8b4ae839e1da8608, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/612a07bafe7500ea7334daec739bfa4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/707cdd1b243c89aab6154418e3353603, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83d6e7b00ec7bae4657f3248f0013dba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c65c815a9cebf09e9098ccc640b3fee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af06434041c6548ebcb903f47cb592bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29bf616cad5b2d4a7d609bbc3d6ec25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db9a2b5efe1d9fa9191d5f09e531809a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e76da6a4e8907ed7463115fd274d31a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6d71bef36c4a31d2c317359f6007ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7dbfbd2c90c21a16c9916c8b4a84cfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe357144b4a15099e3a3e1e976a096c6"

Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10690da5e00c379d2b0a0cb556e0b46e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b84b5f0c8b2ad4420b3eb9c942e1cf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2235f4d097b451c34227b8e9adacf8c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28fdd8716e699731f30ebf4224e6fabe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29c356c650f4aee2deeac37f7350ed05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3294ce924b08dac6de1e52d7f2003bc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b9d74dd4cf560f60fd5c4304eb04dd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43b66fa7129ba41236acbe8776507886, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/456563fcf427e02ceaa8f6dadb6ef2d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a8b28009f51950477c935b54bdedc85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d0a874d137acf932b8c70bd8fe29d3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/840fcde68bf5c52264db1fc20bfb6993, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88043e0fcfce952ac39239df539deb28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8efc049099c4e59ba16f06d68e94c5c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/972e42a4bb5c0d797ec2c383ed2678ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f443e61b64cdccab66508a02b212379, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3ce65badb9ff0c6e2b556b2f76dc003, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c51a213483e49e4820b3fe92ba72a09b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb1f62f9579a2e13a2ca427cd2b6952b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbea1b2e9696215c5bb4759d1df7585b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd09204ce641143c1b653c32465359c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd15f885f414b911bed461bbccb99e19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb27eb75276cdeedc3eb4d37777d27d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de817c421cf8b75934ebc9055e46d368, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e058dd008d682be927aa604dd124aab7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed653cfec9798b5d4d743e983e9837fd"

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clears some PPE (e.g., surgical masks (SM)) as class II medical devices, and regulates some (e.g. surgical head cover) as class I exempt devices. For respiratory protection, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are used. One type of PPE, “surgical N95 respirators”, is a NIOSH-approved FFR that is also cleared by the FDA for use in medical settings. The surgical environment poses unique risks such as the potential for surgical fires. As part of its substantial equivalence determination process, FDA requests testing of flammability and other parameters for SM and surgical N95 respirators. A lack of data regarding flammability of PPE used in healthcare exists. We hypothesize that commonly used PPE, regardless of whether regulated and/or cleared by FDA or not, will pass an industry standard such as the 16 CFR 1610 flammability test. METHODS: Eleven N95 FFR models, eight surgical N95 respirator models, seven SM models, five surgical head cover models, and five PAPR hood models were evaluated for flammability with a 45 degree flammability tester using the 16 CFR 1610 method. Three common fabrics were included for comparison. RESULTS: All of the PPE samples regulated/and or cleared by FDA or not, passed the flammability test at class 1 (normal flammability), meaning they are less likely to burn. Only one of the three common fabrics, a cotton fabric at the lowest basis weight, was class 3 (high flammability). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the study suggest that NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs would likely pass the 16 CFR 1610 flammability standard. Moreover, results suggest that NIOSH is capable of undertaking flammability testing using the 16 CFR 1610 standard as the flammability results NIOSH obtained for N95 FFRs were comparable to the results obtained by a third party independent laboratory.",""

Nonetheless, it has long been known that normal speech also yields large quantities of particles that are too small to see by eye, but are large enough to carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens. Here we show that the rate of particle emission during normal human speech is positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude) of vocalization, ranging from approximately 1 to 50 particles per second (0.06 to 3 particles per cm(3)) for low to high amplitudes, regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic). Furthermore, a small fraction of individuals behaves as “speech superemitters,” consistently releasing an order of magnitude more particles than their peers. Our data demonstrate that the phenomenon of speech superemission cannot be fully explained either by the phonic structures or the amplitude of the speech. These results suggest that other unknown physiological factors, varying dramatically among individuals, could affect the probability of respiratory infectious disease transmission, and also help explain the existence of superspreaders who are disproportionately responsible for outbreaks of airborne infectious disease.",""

Among all open reading frames (orfs) of this virus, the orf3a is the largest, and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids, named as 3a protein. Sequence analysis suggests that the orf3a aligned to one calcium pump present in Plasmodium falciparum and the enzyme glutamine synthetase found in Leptospira interrogans. This sequence similarity was found to be limited only to amino acid residues 209–264 which form the cytoplasmic domain of the orf3a. Furthermore, this region was predicted to be involved in the calcium binding. Owing to this hypothesis, we were driven to establish its calcium binding property in vitro. Here, we expressed and purified the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein, called Cyto3a, as a recombinant His-tagged protein in the E. coli. The calcium binding nature was established by performing various staining methods such as ruthenium red and stains-all. 45Ca overlay method was also done to further support the data. Since the 3a protein forms ion channels, we were interested to see any conformational changes occurring in the Cyot3a upon calcium binding, using fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. These studies clearly indicate a significant change in the conformation of the Cyto3a protein after binding with calcium. Our results strongly suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein of SARS-CoV binds calcium in vitro, causing a change in protein conformation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11a394d63aab5e0fb3bf05e90d92ffaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12873dee7623da630ce6e85a3f207585, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/152fecd1f373ce7e83d1f3103a963e1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e435895ee3802cfde29e5df736d9e0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/233b5f373bbb63304393613e8414cb49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34c30a7a1dd5954e07a304a52d320214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d3de15f6e795f89bbf010c27e452889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43e0c5b642ba005d80ca68ea64aa9307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4484a29f48452ec50759f7d157c464ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45d9caf4189c83a4fa15975c6af913b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/470de3c06446a10e61d5a66ce35e5004, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d5cb4e612d125ee94375045293abaaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/541cea08dad9ab2046c4668a5344f469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5698f8385b3c74b501a38f35ceed9323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/597cf17e9f15ffc3cca9e33e37052c25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a1cd4147fb9acbdbbe0d0b0d9150414, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/620b1c4b77e3e08061b92e98c2854bd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6273081d96c80a6dca4c1fa812e33c3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62f27a54beaf0c9f9302f9ee894bc28f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/656c6c52aa2bbe43cef9a39044719972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67d7289c53db235dc741b3098b96573b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70f00808c8b1feffbc655dab00b041d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72c7dc9397fffe97fb7b2a49db06038d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7375a3f7f950705b3c703868c019b79c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87c96425594dac4e50420ddce6de68a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af40d2b656493763d64a42c586040bdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6f6fc2b48a2ba43e988260b329c2e3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c11192e4ecce67db07ba7ae16fe6db69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6336b2ff31d4d653221422c431304af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c66ed4e8d60c0bfb9f0eb3c347c34f3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c71e1be4e1d757aebec203dbc7a0a752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c93df2510a7cd5d97817e9828558d81f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9f7e858c863fb6d3c75e14f8f1f10ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdbc6f76d89b1b5a936aa99a99f464a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d66d4f915ed51cf193ae58a80f33b8f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dabeb66275af6ccd24ae3b87c91df9e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbcf8255e2a46f1aa4a083209314ace3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd40e943f7690072e93b9859dafced7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/deb2128c042dccfd7a0846c80fd2bdde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3fcc3cd07509b65e3fc7c91a8dc72ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee4bcf90083aca56b977ded2fe6bd692, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f11940e5db843eac6ed2365c7a241145, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8571add6d2919473b9bc34407dbd010"

Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991). Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C3H, and C57BL/6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM2-related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the MHVR and mmCGM2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin-like domains [MHVR(2d)] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4d)L]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM2 and MHVR(2d), and the MHVR(4d)L isoform served as functional virus receptors for MHV-A59. This is the first report of multiple related glycoprotein isoforms that can serve as functional receptors for a single enveloped virus.",""

Such an analysis, embodied within the DS GeneAtlas™ pipeline, has been used to critically evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) genome with the goal of identifying new potential targets for viral therapeutic intervention. This paper discusses several new functional hypotheses on the roles played by the constituent gene products of SARS, and will serve as an example of how such assignments can be developed or extended on other systems of interest.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/272e444e2bf9e2904c6a29bf48c5cc9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5721f96828e4bbbaf8a10cf6fba62e0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80c8e7266d1e5bde2681f17dd53b121f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e1c779ac70e2857f221ca4d70f1f2c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99567de7ab97a05cb66acd6acabc68ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef1c2e5c8aa117952d566a5fd89a0433"

Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06168ae57677e6ecb576012d679458c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b82d905f3820aefad5a4692ac9aa99e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1349a065d530bf6b7549302fb30505b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a64daef2d5e8f5dd29048eb2029967d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22df31e3a3a0b5138c139670c636fc68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/260843ccf1d54cca37cb8fd6dcc4f503, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dcded6830296376f90f66d402f2e63e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/324e2f62f3fd7149a7cb1f32a82f10e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e3e7082afde2713a4d89ecaae4628ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ed46b395c154b0857cc0ad06adc5363, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43bf30a469f62d7d957758cd22a217b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c5083dac0a80d7cfdd18839b3dba4dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f42513c55869db1d2dba5d6a5fd37bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f4c52937662e0b76d8f687ef7a7352d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b402f86daf82a18ce0ac60b4bd07d44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/630001202a09fbf1f8ae778b52f19c08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c57e58543a4dcce9f44210625193794, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d7611dbf6f58aaa3d096a866d310263, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f804a19d509af43ff3bbd47d2db4b85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70d9c632e6089121c3f13fe663d148f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71c2a312261ed09546edc7cd6f192265, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7511b433af94cd0b307592ed60fd0eb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fb36f524e004ae3fded31e81609b5ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/847ce1683669669ebc96ab1aaa004a1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88ae6745ad9b14fbe9a448b63aef8826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bca8db68773db32a073efc2b41dca2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fe4210b1505989f22ac604a84d8f8f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ec5a9f528e017fad64b4803357b73a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a37372c29b7c66b6707992087b4c233a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b64811dc868b908609603a53959414ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b84f5df2fa6693cfab7d8150356ec010, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9952ca0f053a7889649f695d406078d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdfb833a9af1486b1bed7e6003df226a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfd59c8ceaa2d0b2995f336de4f23ae7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c157841e4b358adb55ab3e6deaeabbdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2996ecf3bc0ebd9740cc35ea6fc2b42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8bba40f9b58742e23c244e90f9b35b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf0ee07ea148b0c6ef6b5f2a89f1bc21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfa8aa526a49b7dcf58ca700d23b86f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d03013a419bcc04bb268e0eb980499db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbcb41eb2e3d9be87d33dc2dfa39fc05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0444c0af67dc7ff8a7509375a8518dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e17a52f8cc9ff955256b99aa4db1590f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3220d0739e104b03416b4f7e1b92850, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4eaa13d83a3f2bbca1108686a15f6c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7d8c059235831db76e9ff95afaa4762, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec143b770c3bfd91b9f28817dd25f5d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee92e831d48184d305b16d6bb97614f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eed60256af9a97c73eb9dbeaf620b8cc"

The prevalence of HRV-bronchiolitis may be very high in predisposed infants. HRV diagnosis is almost exclusively based on PCR, which detects respiratory infections with or without symptoms. Two immunologic factors, interferon responses and atopy, have been associated with susceptibility to HRV-bronchiolitis in multiple studies. The current data supports the hypothesis that susceptibility to HRV-bronchiolitis is likely to be an early manifestation of biased immune responses, which are linked to both decreased viral defence and atopic airway inflammation. Prospective studies have consistently shown that early wheezing associated with HRV infection is closely associated with recurrent wheezing and the development of asthma in children. Collectively, these studies suggest that HRV infection in wheezing children could serve as a clinically useful marker for early identification of asthma prone children. The findings to date provide the rationale for future studies to incorporate rhinovirus illnesses into asthma risk indices.",""

It is well established that in many instances, the brain plays an important role in the onset and progression of hypertension via activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Further, the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and of glial cell-mediated proinflammatory processes have independently been linked to this neural control and are, as a consequence, both attractive targets for the development of antihypertensive therapeutics. Although it is clear that the predominant effector peptide of the RAS, ANG II, activates its type-1 receptor on neurons to mediate some of its hypertensive actions, additional nuances of this brain RAS control of blood pressure are constantly being uncovered. One of these complexities is that the RAS is now thought to impact cardiovascular control, in part, via facilitating a glial cell-dependent proinflammatory milieu within cardiovascular control centers. Another complexity is that the newly characterized antihypertensive limbs of the RAS are now recognized to, in many cases, antagonize the prohypertensive ANG II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R)-mediated effects. That being said, the mechanism by which the RAS, glia, and neurons interact to regulate blood pressure is an active area of ongoing research.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe ARDS. METHODS: Eighteen male Beagles were studied under mechanical ventilation with anesthesia. Severe ARDS was induced by repetitive oleic acid infusion. After lung injury, Beagles were randomly assigned into spontaneous breathing group (BIPAP(SB)) and abdominal muscle paralysis group (BIPAP(AP)). All groups were ventilated with BIPAP model for 8h, and the high pressure titrated to reached a tidal volume of 6ml/kg, the low pressure was set at 10 cmH(2)O, with I:E ratio 1:1, and respiratory rate adjusted to a PaCO(2) of 35–60 mmHg. Six Beagles without ventilator support comprised the control group. Respiratory variables, end-expiratory volume (EELV) and gas exchange were assessed during mechanical ventilation. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 in lung tissue and plasma were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Lung injury scores were determined at end of the experiment. RESULTS: For the comparable ventilator setting, as compared with BIPAP(SB) group, the BIPAP(AP) group presented higher EELV (427±47 vs. 366±38 ml) and oxygenation index (293±36 vs. 226±31 mmHg), lower levels of IL-6(216.6±48.0 vs. 297.5±71.2 pg/ml) and IL-8(246.8±78.2 vs. 357.5±69.3 pg/ml) in plasma, and lower express levels of IL-6 mRNA (15.0±3.8 vs. 21.2±3.7) and IL-8 mRNA (18.9±6.8 vs. 29.5±7.9) in lung tissues. In addition, less lung histopathology injury were revealed in the BIPAP(AP) group (22.5±2.0 vs. 25.2±2.1). CONCLUSION: Abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation is one of the injurious factors in severe ARDS, so abdominal muscle paralysis might be an effective strategy to minimize ventilator-induce lung injury.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a41e33b69b7d6090ec489a5423307dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/183db40a93315a839eb91f689d3855a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bbb5f0d7598eb180ef53c28ac592566, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36412a253f2a3f5a29ea0ef1c69c237c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/628cdb7f85fe21205324779dc496c4eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e1139f6581e91d9f0bdee060a2d3535, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0f4f2a0ee6dc411307bbd8c3cb9c74a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5ca30b8adca36711cdd622e4c2ef82c"

Another mechanism of protein birth is provided by overlapping genes. They are created de novo by mutations within a coding sequence that lead to the expression of a novel protein in another reading frame, a process called “overprinting.” To investigate this mechanism, we have analyzed the sequences of the protein products of manually curated overlapping genes from 43 genera of unspliced RNA viruses infecting eukaryotes. Overlapping proteins have a sequence composition globally biased toward disorder-promoting amino acids and are predicted to contain significantly more structural disorder than nonoverlapping proteins. By analyzing the phylogenetic distribution of overlapping proteins, we were able to confirm that 17 of these had been created de novo and to study them individually. Most proteins created de novo are orphans (i.e., restricted to one species or genus). Almost all are accessory proteins that play a role in viral pathogenicity or spread, rather than proteins central to viral replication or structure. Most proteins created de novo are predicted to be fully disordered and have a highly unusual sequence composition. This suggests that some viral overlapping reading frames encoding hypothetical proteins with highly biased composition, often discarded as noncoding, might in fact encode proteins. Some proteins created de novo are predicted to be ordered, however, and whenever a three-dimensional structure of such a protein has been solved, it corresponds to a fold previously unobserved, suggesting that the study of these proteins could enhance our knowledge of protein space.",""

This has been due to a combination of factors including the emergence of highly virulent zoonotic pathogens, such as Hendra, Nipah, SARS and Ebola viruses, and the high rate of detection of a large number of previously unknown viral sequences in bat specimens. As bats have ancient evolutionary origins and are the only flying mammals, it has been hypothesized that some of their unique biological features may have made them especially suitable hosts for different viruses. So the question ‘Are bats different, special or exceptional?’ has become a focal point in the field of virology, bat biology and virus-host co-evolution. In this brief review, we examine the topic in a relatively unconventional way, that is, our discussion will be based on both scientific discoveries and theoretical predictions. This approach was chosen partially because the data in this field are so limited that it is impossible to conduct a useful review based on published results only and also because we believe it is important to provoke original, speculative or even controversial ideas or theories in this important field of research.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17c0badc52be8c3254513cc8e9fb6b36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36fb652ee23877417c41a66454d5071a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3adb07a6e1cb96860d06fa16e9e433db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42016def65b0bfae2d0d339e1e5e89c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52a5fdc26c00c857311b50ffac49c581, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a5552a9dadbdf83ebbcd8d9dd7f0243, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78d85b1fdfe2a59a4836ccbe2cd97122, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ab473d3808af22096164a9083b1241a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/943875174c89b208ce22cda992072ac9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98ff23a1888957034fe35caefcce03f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a60ecf167efd9a1cdcebe9e34f920096, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9a0fc6bd8dd1a53696f77c4069e6259, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b313631d1c13a5d612044664669731b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3e05cce8034ba751c6df03fd96a78e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e33baedfa60ba49a3caf2e84f838142a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc1e6feec1392028fcc5fbf926d25108"

These cases of human-to-human transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings, and they are suspected to result from repeated zoonotic introductions. In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04ca75c96e6994d68c495aa37e798131, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b2cf1bb216a993e1814cbca13d39100, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5292f417a4d8583d228ef843f6e0bd9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/600f791c935fe90e05809017dc828405, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60ef0ff1b95ce74b8fab4297e672fff1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/658022dd6b3d4f7d97e3cfea54b0d0e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690d0c6056b388379547f12478892bd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d0020a335e9054db387e814925d6a33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79dfa9dc93ae45ceb3b66265b39d004f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d434f5330bf8d7dae83723d3151fc85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7da1be16ab228da8b189af543a52bd82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8406a496dd685d00e3207ca649d45b02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85a1dd9d238b7c788dfb6ef5199d743f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89161b7f2c11d24ebb3a5d749a27615c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d5f56c85d22a7553540abe8bfb5e2b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1e0447524bd8a8276406b9778d33475, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2f820640c568fd81626371e1780ebb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab9bd5246efd3b3be23ae7bd2f0dfe70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae8840b59252e7e46b21c94e94dbb7a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcd8bdd8e8ac2177d3b06ca62947b24f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c22fa74c4a682c02f2c45d7c2ab9da95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8384c95c24f4478e12088713de60827, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8df8de561a93ba4060473c480c9f699, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d50aed56edf2777ce5b4aa7e789921d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d681ba79ce254df470f95140bc5ae264, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d81cb54500e4b307c04472fa337e2da2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4c23be3b912724deb1556f55b23ae8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5c4f78be4dd4423b854ac77a37baad4"

The current vaccines are less satisfactory to confer protections from heterologous infections and long-term persistence, and the need for better vaccines are urgent. The immunological hallmarks in PRRSV-infected pigs include the unusually poor production of type I interferons (IFNs-α/β) and the aberrant and delayed adaptive immune responses, indicating that PRRSV has the ability to suppress both innate and adaptive immune responses in the host. Type I IFNs are the potent antiviral cytokines and recent studies reveal their pleiotropic functions in the priming of expansion and maturation of adaptive immunity. Thus, IFN antagonism-negative PRRSV is hypothesized to be attenuated and to build effective and broad- spectrum innate and adaptive immune responses in pigs. Such vaccines are promising alternatives to traditional vaccines for PRRSV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11d4ebc9ec817af60548539809df3b31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16fdd8e9c7edaa50f37ed08f98061446, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2653aaa28c5208deac5f0deb3f82106c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35334629cd6af843e74e66623221001e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/412870432e649b30d4c28fa35522f480, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45a495382585c3625a8fe5c7a0e8afe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/462e615b2bd47c94972374dd4c47fc00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5600a59a94924b3882986b73b481223e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58cb5576b7440d0011334a25290e8f09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f96d8a69b99542aafe471d5559bf03f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1224cc19611625761a1acc8e62f9c54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a38e92bb0e56a1de632383c99846831d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b58f6927e218b36b6def5d40e83db8f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d6f13b20f9318e5bab1701522950f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbe205136c9c7a23e4b6a1e991121e00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e80e7ab5c95078e45ade8692cf2884b2"

These various processes must be properly balanced to ensure efficient viral proliferation. To achieve this, higher-order RNA structures near the termini of a variety of RNA virus genomes are thought to play a key role in regulating the specificity and efficiency of viral RNA synthesis. In this study, we have analyzed the signals for minus-strand RNA synthesis in the prototype of the arterivirus family, equine arteritis virus (EAV). Using site-directed mutagenesis and an EAV reverse genetics system, we have demonstrated that a stem-loop structure near the 3′ terminus of the EAV genome is required for RNA synthesis. We have also obtained evidence for an essential pseudoknot interaction between the loop region of this stem-loop structure and an upstream hairpin residing in the gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein. We propose that the formation of this pseudoknot interaction may constitute a molecular switch that could regulate the specificity or timing of viral RNA synthesis. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that phylogenetic analysis predicted the formation of similar pseudoknot interactions near the 3′ end of all known arterivirus genomes, suggesting that this interaction has been conserved in evolution.",""

Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, α-helical C-terminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0027bb313e2fd2196dfd00800bd68071, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0085b403b5f53a9adbbf59f238722d24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04a362593c387f6c43cc1f7d945e3b2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/077b5c6a73dd4ba6e5331040d5175fc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0968b5d52b271b39870913f36cc06652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10cf44ba0a719a6451465ae2e1d6b7ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b9e0caa04b22f125b66316ef74046ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2015e7ab648d1a6573bd93e923d8251d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22932364f98197aa43d8dbef042a2090, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b3f00bc6ef9eca437870b78784c2caa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3995331eb634526804fd138c360e7595, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39c8e8a0193854965c70e837783bb1d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fe1d9f8540775a41bc48f5f5f8f937a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ad7550b4ee8f1ae63b3b4deb1ba55c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c7966052da1651187b8ea3aba9dbbad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bf97709703a14c63e74f4d56c6d8496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6246f0f8f3c497424b09227a88d8b004, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/631ee7706a7c24c2cc31cd8b7fdc69a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70901e857b96129919c9ad32fe50853c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/778b9d60fa33d5c693ef4d94ba78c1de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7945aebc23fd1b3e767c50729d6ede03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ccdcc1eaadb1ed5ee8e2b1b1174a6fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d9b8d8d5b19dcdc69fbadcc90619f5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81d2406818cf241892fd34d766dd9031, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85305f0800bc25e2cfc3b42cbc6023f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f7c91d4172e6ce105c1ed286866aab0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3392bd04f7ccdad42957912bf862866, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3dda2dc6c9b53c0b993566db79d49aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a431abb91dae9e5bab12ce54bb3e3aaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ec9c90775b1438b941844a170fc9c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c92b7ae48ab6c7e48528fd428d0614ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0119848ca6c3f535fe63909e0250f96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5fe7920c7a7e14281a66a25041352dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/deb02e23cdca6419fa73913ddf7036d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfcbd0e8adeeb714fb8f63d094dfcd71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e36a22d8dce0a109653dd00ebbb828f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1fcb4369797f40e7ed3a4404e1501be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fef27195151d412315b54469ad78e841"

Compared with controls, mice inoculated with MNV4 alone had altered levels of serum biomarkers, and flow cytometric analysis of immune cells from MNV4-infected mice showed changes in both dendritic cell (CD11c(+)) and other nonT cell (CD4(−) CD8(−)) populations. Dendritic cells isolated from MNV4-infected mice induced higher IFNγ production by polyclonal T cells in vitro at 2 d after infection but not at later time points, indicating that MNV4 infection enhances antigen presentation by dendritic cells early after acute infection. These findings indicate that acute infection with MNV4 is immunomodulatory and alters disease progression in a mouse model of IBD.",""

The virus emerged in the US in 2013, resulting in severe production losses. Effective vaccine development against PEDV is a challenge. Inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy. Attenuated vaccines, while more effective, require a relatively long lead development time, are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks. To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities. We expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model. Following the heat and RNAse treatment, PEDV virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells, indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro. Strong PEDV spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets. Upon challenge, all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology, while the unvaccinated controls were not. The vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge; nor did they develop intestinal lesions. Thus, the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for PEDV immunization.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c2750d37e98693fdd679ad38e97dfc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15175ac3ba5ba39740759ebfe5cd6494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c8f47edaacc4b2253f30bed6acc8173, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2340cfa74dd06ad413b55db6b9ee7d53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25ad1165a4f867fb70f77dd708fafb96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/283a4b7ea8268939033d35e7752ed913, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3950e16d3677ad3d36f51a71dc383a38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41b74e5f684ec9ce6cf7802f5e5e37b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/536d26b4cf0f74665cc0872e09eaf989, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58c89d8c4859be7f002e7b1359869320, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59629a66cac3ab37f3e42a7ba8d2b1cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65ea278779b77ca942de199774dacaed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/683ebaf88d26c42febe4b7715c69d04e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6939c66eaffe7b5f39545517398a4503, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6db1acb9c8091adac06a215ab442c168, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78b385b6ad211d805a011289a7269f74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81b706304f47037491c80716cf055d00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83b665ba11f790fa578e7a748535f11d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/866f6ba3726add5110b817376a7bad7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92b8ea96216f82fd472eb0dcccd7bdfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/945d892b011364685390ef1f1e0c1ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b089f951769d00b6e5c1c7f072d7157, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5bdd82d9b552a0a65caec63b7e689ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab184a337ba54e153a75eae138cfc697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9f39db8b0244f95125feaac53c039f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc9403706032116976601ce6dc8d52f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2dd3bb99d41b28f7bad604c6aaa5ba8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c31511286dbe232510cc07a8667edd79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c53e34b7aaadf74f7edf11081038caca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9930a7a415d17e13537841241ff01be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfa910afd1cc19b285bf5d29bc778209, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfab419c4dcfbc79d45a860c3563061c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2eb715dae0ec644f26d8e51ab7c98d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcdcca01edf1733aa9178431da61a99f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e06406b3c32f5812f0cf05046b14332a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4695ed391a0a6ef267f2b2fcd689e9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6a380aa8a016cbf0b93855bdb2b3704, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f97a42d0acd4f105d9e71b94e6db7e26"

Such a structure could result from a two-stage folding process, during which preformed transmembrane helices with independent stability pack without topological rearrangement. This view was originally prompted by experiments in which fragments of transmembrane regions were separately refolded into lipid bilayers and subsequently brought together to yield a functional protein. Other lines of evidence, including the existence of ‘one-helix’ miniproteins, gene-fusion experiments, helix-driven oligomerization of bitopic proteins, and sequence rearrangements in the course of evolution support this view. Although it forms a useful basis for structural predictions, the limitations of the two-stage folding hypothesis are not clearly defined, and the proportion of integral membrane proteins to which it applies remains uncertain. The papers discussed in the present review illustrate recent progress along these lines.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1149022323380d9af2c898edfc923440, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/199d837f9707ab993759fe6af0d6db3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2019280352d041d75ca55f605b90e974, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a606c7a3df4ce4b63153c4c2164e983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58180ef3962665d22f1e6a62598adf34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ada835b1fc19f8261e47e9b5d9e45e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bf89800005fc3f2ff1e4303d525fa35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83ff71acacb2bf3ad563aa0215f2a827, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87323e02a00068de5d16cc06d60f6cec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b36ea99e5398872aaaf5266137a6111, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd1f27ca9af50401395f8b0f8150f2ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d59366767669870511571a6facea7f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f82b706ae7fe8236d2f74bc9c54c8999"

One efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Using this antibody, we found that two commercial vaccines contained statistically different amounts of the decoy epitope. The vaccine with lower levels of decoy epitope induced a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibody after immunization. This antibody can be used as an analytical tool to monitor the quality of a vaccine from batch to batch.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1123521d786cdfd2017cd7f83d5a0277, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1586053273e2ea8a8b6f7d9eb55acf64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32906ab7618555635cca00b1456cf21a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f736ea8fe03ca182befda9538d0f17e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fa451957bb76d1feae0b93c42e5f74b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5501e2227650e7555dc663c3f6f7b2d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a8372db24db42dc79a6231324fd87ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60f088fdcba9aca59169961b9369316d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67f8ff22caa6c02b7e60a40da8beb7aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a5cc75c8e5d6fa9eaddb76602fb533f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c875cf6cc2f449d78e279719776d243, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80c322689ca6a6fbdedba58299d7f672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e92f118300ff1a775ed5426242d72a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919d4442c347a13c1e32f5414deaa2a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/925f65370e106991575902699d74c13d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8d3349cc4bb6843b0454ce341e651d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caa47f9aa44a67c99dcdb0caa1274de4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caf7bf5299f2a43dd1a1c547ba74bf94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8afdad26237da85f1f91fc6a24af65b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e958f5693ff91057f9aa3bdbe6aa4161, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea614f4589b584f45734ba2be36f56eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0eac2f85f81b8dffe308b24763bfb58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fafb8092a463f1e87b487460d679a14c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffb76cb670bb9a3de377258a0381827e"

To identify the regions of the viral genome involved in this process, we used SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify RNA aptamers which bind specifically to Core in vitro. Comparison of these aptamers to multiple HCV genomes revealed the presence of a conserved terminal loop motif within short RNA stem-loop structures. We postulated that interactions of these motifs, as well as sub-motifs which were present in HCV genomes at statistically significant levels, with the Core protein may drive virion assembly. We mutated 8 of these predicted motifs within the HCV infectious molecular clone JFH-1, thereby producing a range of mutant viruses predicted to possess altered RNA secondary structures. RNA replication and viral titre were unaltered in viruses possessing only one mutated structure. However, infectivity titres were decreased in viruses possessing a higher number of mutated regions. This work thus identified multiple novel RNA motifs which appear to contribute to genome packaging. We suggest that these structures act as cooperative packaging signals to drive specific RNA encapsidation during HCV assembly.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06f25ca776a4d3817edf83e261eb7f63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0728ee05dbcdf5f85dc559c08275d34f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eb9a49a027791869adf52b20b96fe45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14927d130d07d060bb540b65d8e01bf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27fa0256099a3f486d4d073ef4eec3f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46e34a5cb0d681162078a849f385c7ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fc1cacd9f14a6df8c2bc71afcaca8c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/516e3c01e79124e57620556e3cb0eabc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5621adcaed0b365b260545bb699043c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/654c35501a68ff441d57338bc84d3abd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/757d528300eed6b669f14ca6f5a4cff9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e3d60ca1c9342b21b7e075020a2986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a33a691b888d277db2a71884c2097ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f980fb23bd56d97646ccff558535917, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85e9061ec2f12edab666c4148233719e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ff20351d763687948852aa3a7c8bb07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91c8bbbc37af9af34c842a3068afa7b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92fe539c98ef3abe3a2b5275857f698b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6b29bab9084bbe0c748e57efb8a84a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aabb56cc3cd3c5c98a59b197cb8f2838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b30193fb959a4cb53da0e8314497ca71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b410ba7a9f5601352613e282fa8f53c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8b7c104aad3370e9c09c305842f216c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf1915817d46a24b5f5f7085aada948d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf9e5fcf35c5a7f200537e3e21d89454, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7277584fc4bb9c95f3cc64f115300b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbffc4c28e4519930eacf211686f39ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd334f3b8d82336ee92fa35137125e45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddb3662d0f4cc1d5108c161fec2ff08c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec3cb100a0ecc5ff2b3438c76d966436, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f802536c8505655b9d1029f08ced5e62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff6c4ce9d2044074fa879a3cdd6d94d5"

Phylogenetic analysis of the S2 gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data resulted in groups of strains that were the same as groupings observed when S1 sequence data was used. Thus, it appears that S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes. Although the sequence differences were small, we found that only a few amino acid differences were responsible for different secondary structure predictions for the S2 subunit. It is likely that these changes create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which could affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype specific epitopes are located. Based on this sequence data, we hypothesize that the S2 subunit can affect specific antibody binding to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09668736d589de1479ce577ac317945c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0efef081522ac07a5afaa39e5fe5bfec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/308f9f3c3559cdc6777bcc43ddca311c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d9d5e6c81d351973ccb24a71977350c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/600524709a58b1b8cdfadee4b5d38d0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60799364b26e1937d52791ef17d941d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72619f212f73fec2a0047db07a745d55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d3d1fd805afc824d831a754d4db9954, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/868a16c214b6e1b5afb07e2186fdac56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8907236ca5cf786e332e069f4c1a3dd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b94738c74ae01921bd9226718b67c5d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba875b9ff6d97f0024a817dba30d2549, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb9c849f761e322a01799a9efb626ecf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c23c7b8b2fc8a61f3a2337c6d379c469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7f2e39a78c04c36daf7b052205f90d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9c704e62715b55ae66b6c1332326672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc1c1cf913e35c7201364b7db5a89fdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7350e663ace4dba388aa9ba01ded389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e378b080d95c9451f2e6890658fd1c4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e970f1a9e6bc9edbf1dff3633d80f675, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9cccbf94ac3beb8d5316ef2422d97db"

A separate ‘torsional restraint’ model suggests that mRNA pseudoknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes directed to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery site positioned at the ribosome's A- and P-decoding sites [J. D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115–1127]. Here, experiments using a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’ having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of multiple i.v. injections of 10% butaphosphan and 0.005% cyanocobalamin combination (Catosal, Bayer Animal Health, Leverkusen, Germany) between 1 and 2 wk antepartum (a.p.) on the metabolism and health of dairy cows. Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.p. and postpartum (p.p.). Health status and milk production were monitored p.p. Serum cyanocobalamin concentration increased in groups C6 and C3 p.p. Multiple daily i.v. injections of Catosal before parturition increased p.p. glucose availability, as evaluated by p.p. serum glucose concentration, and decreased peripheral fat mobilization and ketone body formation, as evaluated by p.p. serum nonesterified fatty acid and β-OH butyrate concentrations. The number of puerperal infections in the first 5 d after calving was decreased in group C6, relative to group C0. We conclude that multiple injections of Catosal during the close-up period have a beneficial effect on the metabolism of periparturient dairy cows. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-producing dairy cows in early lactation may have a relative or actual deficiency of cyanocobalamin.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1278759daa770274f101699645a83941, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13024d33f617e4f2b14f6d1dee500b40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13474e63ffbd9bb89d0595d4edbfb196, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/225134ca624377d3d6202b220836312d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24b810ccebf1d4cac9ca9dc70378492b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268e54caa592fc736b430edb7bcbd677, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a7d886c67ad6a5094293296b663ce3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31188dce909a5476f917acffc36a09fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34691bb007c52876478880e9f148e449, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36bca3cc2172572124a705e391902542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bdbc595bb7e02be45e77ef3b6bfb9d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/566ab02d391436bc7831d9867e69ed76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5713b9449d19ae68c34a970df4010beb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59b11c6c9bde4dfdfa30ad645678aca6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e859da1dbf5ab2ca0fddf55cad8c211, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c58edd52335ff9a964ce79d828582cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f107ddef6af8482248121f7c7f0910d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9af12284cd618d7e28de789a03855667, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a94c5590fdf275a3ec24ef6dc94fb302, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aabde369e94e079338d0cbb7cb3d4d9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab691c1268c07b6cf574b14e67243c61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af1ed7eb1bd1ac1e8ad623055175f0a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af77278b282c064977c5b17a79951e4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc8e7fc029851f2a2bb57118e5109b1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf4128bfbe9ee86e1f1a2ce0b19ea1ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0baa2eaac54c45041fc1fdcbdd13dfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e592b5b6b65fcd70c47d76496b452fd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb5f5e3a09844ee5ebf2d6a1ad431b10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0034a2912aea9c3ba63e51c6961ed30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd673f4ee2bbfd4069d685a14dcd0fa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fed60e631ef8b404191a56c810c44632"

Tools to study EBOV entry have been limited to static immunofluorescence or biochemical and functional analysis. In a recent article in mBio, Spence et al. reported a novel, live-cell-imaging method that tracks this transformational journey of EBOV in real time [J. S. Spence, T. B. Krause, E. Mittler, R. K. Jangra, and K. Chandran, mBio 7(1):e01857-15, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01857-15]. The assay validates known mechanisms of EBOV entry and sheds light on some novel intricacies. Direct evidence supports the hypothesis that fusion is a rare event that starts in maturing early endosomes, is completed in late endosomes, and occurs entirely in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive (NPC1(+)) compartments. The study demonstrated that lipid mixing and productive fusion are temporally decoupled, with different energetic barriers and a protease-dependent step between the two events. Analysis of the mechanism of action of an important class of EBOV neutralizing antibodies, such as KZ52 and ZMapp, provides direct evidence that these antibodies act by inhibiting the membrane fusion.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/202c41ff3fa95f7913bd5fe7afe44f80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/274729ddc257224f8d63a3410990c509, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34d5383fa4beb0d3924d9deecec31f64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35ea54465af99db75fdc4c1933d0b01c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62409e0386757a1a206626b861df03dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/782ccdbe66bbf60c3bcc6746e2577ca2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/807529be7e42495983a459e0fa756a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a069af58bc8ec5d04c8d3b6df9fb12b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a42ea96a1146354c894de74a8f6020e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3d95adcbb46a6697382c750ac7cacec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0580b1493efeedde36ef4a8778ba9f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f27df5e8f06073e332eb97471101ffd2"

To verify the hypothesis, the effect of miR-222 on mitochondrial dysfunction was tested and we showed that miR-222 attenuated TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-222 in TGEV-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, a quantitative proteomic analysis of PK-15 cells that were transfected with miR-222 mimics and infected with TGEV was performed. In total, 4151 proteins were quantified and 100 differentially expressed proteins were obtained (57 upregulated, 43 downregulated), among which thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) and cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) were downregulated. THBS1 was identified as the target of miR-222. Knockdown of THBS1 and CD47 decreased mitochondrial Ca(2+) level and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level. Reversely, overexpression of THBS1 and CD47 elevated mitochondrial Ca(2+) level and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level.

Both of these systems are chronically activated in CHF. The RAAS consists of an excitatory arm involving Angiotensin II (Ang II), Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), and the Ang II type 1 Receptor (AT1R). The RAAS also consists of a protective arm consisting of Angiotensin-1-7 (Ang -1-7), the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R), ACE2 and the mas receptor. Sympathoexcitation in CHF is driven, in large part, by an imbalance of these two arms, with an increase in the Ang II-AT1R-ACE arm and a decrease in the AT2R-ACE2 arm. This imbalance is manifested in cardiovascular-control regions of the brain such as the rostral ventrolateral medulla and paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus. This review focuses on current literature that describes the components of these two arms of the RAAS, and their imbalance in the CHF state. Moreover, this review provides additional evidence for the relevance of ACE2 and Ang-1-7 as key players in the regulation of central sympathetic outflow in CHF. Finally we also examine the effects of exercise training as a therapeutic strategy and the molecular mechanisms at play in CHF, in part, because of the ability of exercise training to restore the balance of the RAAS axis and sympathetic outflow.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/068c6eaf4b9a39025022a8b909bad7f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a574f70cdb8db0aaf30a42cc3abff29, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dba881baa9f9a152a5a4ba213814951, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19a471fc62e79800e84fc05e7312476b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ab8d5a4e4c1a210d8783f43aa21c043, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1be835b23f710b95a13fd1120fb2ce28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22aebb79acba671f4a5e657856c77d0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fcbc0563669d401c556a2a2603191d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45008d6ff725ad5fd8827b3bc3374d26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46a34da1a701ba5e52edc42715667a43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ce401660a8ae1d7ab1ab53c921ebf5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d3c6ade1e0090df0ea53630d9505448, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4eb302643a9d596b01c6f39d08652c7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/505fdedbd7fe36d622a7268744697a85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/527bc5b99ebb3cc8974111125628e87c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a6c55ca8efb8dca1d0a44c1af4c9ccf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/655f4a448b0184848301bb8218d23439, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71538b0d16d3642e0e598cc869a553a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/764994a6f71df96a86bb200d2bff966b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8551e5b2c5f5a9c418455cad84d19b4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/857147c28650236a5024eb47a712b0f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8760218f7f8fb475ea4dce05aae81f7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87cd6235e1e8bf81970ef5aad78589ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d5c9094f6c1f54f60400ae5754f814f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92a1034f68857333cf00df7d17cc1388, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/931b1e5aa7dc21782a6f9bb79e2b755b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a361abbb373ce7f775529b7256b1601, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a16e62483a712ce7e6e10ca264e6e62f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a67d54fe6c283d947d4ccc06a6795b71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aed58e67bfb372182ee39636bba311bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b04af61dea8ed1bf77112b042f5706b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4205a7b2052d17692d04ab5163d9f6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b585c99c23641c7498c306e22296d4b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be87645e49a566f5ec7744bf674e4bd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf5bd44c50fe0235bed0d5ac8a9f6677, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1e8186514e793a6b60754802cee50be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd147b34cdfb885bff0a81deb37ce7b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd914e1feaaef75b40137b0878a44882, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce27b85d0ddb403f5db318fe90ce37d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d84fea1fa63a0afe6b3d6a704fda5860, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/def47ac237aac7dbd34e0ed9da222b89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec16c37b7896fe84ac49d1206f47a6be"

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/244f7d3ca78a8b92ed8b7ab32f9adaa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f7218c1560c6e81ead3f10b678d0023, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/594f5822b1a34eacd3301b4efac6630f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8498aac2097abbe4131f2f1dd650ac81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4a17eaca17799b40de6e0718ce93a1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6da3b9c55d87c3e4badd69f187eed94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae01ec0250c4af9cbe936122f4821735, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afb39623a134894d6f731de5bd5c7ad8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5fdff663eef3b081fc5b106a4770e8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba94834c244f0ddcc74e504cac769602, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb4247e97402077531c0bed9d172ed82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc87dc465b610948834670de849b8d5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cead91226e451daa0efbd8633cbc587a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e618ba2cdf3d4ae7f9b25ebb8837ac0c"

This Series paper examines the evidence for immune dysregulation in catatonia. Activation of the innate immune system is associated with mutism, withdrawal, and psychomotor retardation, which constitute the neurovegetative features of catatonia. Evidence is sparse and conflicting for acute-phase activation in catatonia, and whether this feature is secondary to immobility is unclear. Various viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections have been associated with catatonia, but it is primarily linked to CNS infections. The most common cause of autoimmune catatonia is N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, which can account for the full spectrum of catatonic features. Autoimmunity appears to cause catatonia less by systemic inflammation than by the downstream effects of specific actions on extracellular antigens. The specific association with NMDAR encephalitis supports a hypothesis of glutamatergic hypofunction in catatonia.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19cf0d8e627091aa2145e3f630abd6a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cb40d6a304aa498ea4796d44c616d57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/203a9ceaf243fb68a46b3bfdb80476da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21efbaefc4882fd443ce7630e101dc8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4106a9cc6e4de74f6a3028688690294e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/423800776522ca380342fe770e2f384f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4434220baf2510d01e1f5406271136f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45b5f9f805d51c634f485bfc7c33d9ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e2993260acd48b72fb2e2ecfd64e9da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57973ea1008d176d790c62bfc1398641, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60c381c97a7cfec1d6aad295c4984c5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a0622607e6ee9975309d250eea4d10e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6abdf0220c3921215145b53bbb61e869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7015ecc3f0536d11f5889094ee9aa455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a59fb6c808265c3b06ab4519af3514, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7853b184dfc7db0591749c0fe9b2d741, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87f7329bef044e40306f40dd9307b847, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1f58e573671091d2c1f17b48d350bb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ad624b7ef25bc08f8383d3ee2bf9e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b03a6e6ad2a9f7e327cb1337abe79ee8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2068fffdabfc1653b5c61cea23ccd1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3ab5ae5fabd57b69c5d706cd9b9b5b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b77ce94b922ce82e0bed6028569d85f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b79e5aac12c2838ea00084da5b648722, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b94589372d202fe36194f6b2b79710ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c18bb8cd8f0e440374c4b1bdae066192, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c952266ebc31b1e1ce7a79dac74d3d00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbe0f89d5b3f3a5a12707b89c063cb24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9606dd88f16e21865531b0b01692538"

However, a growing body of literature has indicated the importance of DP-restricted responses in the context of cancer, allergy, and infectious disease. In the current study, we developed high-throughput binding assays for the five most common HLA-DPB1 alleles in the general worldwide population. Using these assays on a comprehensive panel of single-substitution analogs and large peptide libraries, we derived novel detailed binding motifs for DPB1*0101 and DPB1*0501. We also derived more detailed quantitative motifs for DPB1*0201, DPB1*0401, and DPB1*0402, which were previously characterized on the basis of sets of eluted ligands and/or limited sets of substituted peptides. Unexpectedly, all five DP molecules, originally selected only on the basis of their frequency in human populations, were found to share largely overlapping peptide motifs. Testing panels of known DP epitopes and a panel of peptides spanning a set of Phleum pratense Ags revealed that these molecules also share largely overlapping peptide-binding repertoires. This demonstrates that a previously hypothesized DP supertype extends far beyond what was originally envisioned and includes at least three additional very common DP specificities. Taken together, these DP supertype molecules are found in >90% of the human population. Thus, these findings have important implications for epitope-identification studies and monitoring of human class II-restricted immune responses.",""

Researchers from different fields are working to build a framework for understanding how to best evaluate, quantify, and predict different kinds of impacts by non-indigenous species (NIS). In this context, there has been some controversy regarding the appropriate way to define invasive species and the invasion process, given the widespread use of these terms in both scientific and nonscientific frameworks. Although scientists have not unambiguously identified tax-independent characteristics that define all invasive species, the invasion process itself has been observed to progress through the same sequence of stages regardless of taxonomic identity (i.e., initial establishment, expansion, and saturation). Several non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment and spread of non-indigenous species in new environments. In the scenario of global change, species introductions and invasions are a major topic due to ecological impacts (e.g., changes in biodiversity), economic and social impacts (e.g., costs incurred for control or eradication or pests) and human health impacts (e.g., epidemics or increased exposure to hazards). Current research highlights the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species as both a consequence and cause of global change with repercussions on ecosystems, economies, and human societies.",""

However, the mode of virus transmission is not well understood. The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection. We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication. We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid. In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice. Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. With the progression of the enteric infection, inflammation, virus-positive cells, and live viruses emerged in the lung tissues, indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/071b2d5f74540cd67a2e67628dea8477, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0be054067152980405770afb70b4391b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12e7fca0fb225a3b331f00734c6b769b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16880d5614732f2e161ea24caf3e00e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/419e3a84917dd150f30705f7c6dba42d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53d4cf5075f459c7b959b174485b3f65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5770663e420a0341cff357cb2bb415b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74db279c1597b711e23a9f8c08467bf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8075ca85038ddaf8953b57b22795fb1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85957024ded19e87d71c13375f5bcc94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85b699854fa790395065120ed7f74953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/875e8d6faef7f011e98cb5fa2340e85a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87f833ca5e1a5c17f9e986231e84f6ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a430456b367acd58d8419c13eea0cf30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5ed2f6036baae28693766fe13a27b54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acad0893a568d92b1f22b377f290058b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b07b263e5a607c561d963f7cd0f04a48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1cfce89eb965fba2553e0b6a21cb56d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c91201c56b56b8f7038b79eb108b4d1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cda2e921a7f954911e3b38a1c661499d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f65f9247f7ad8dd2fceec29ca56275c6"

We previously demonstrated that pathogenic SIVmac239 and a live-attenuated, quintuple deglycosylated Env mutant (Δ5G) virus target CD4(+) T cells residing in different tissues during acute infection. SIVmac239 and Δ5G preferentially infected distinct CD4(+) T cells in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) and within the lamina propria of the small intestine, respectively (C. Sugimoto et al., J Virol 86:9323–9336, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00948-12). Here, we studied the host responses relevant to SIV targeting of CXCR3(+) CCR5(+) CD4(+) T cells in SLOs. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that Th1-polarized inflammatory responses, defined by expression of CXCR3 chemokines, were distinctly induced in the SIVmac239-infected animals. Consistent with robust expression of CXCL10, CXCR3(+) T cells were depleted from blood in the SIVmac239-infected animals. We also discovered that elevation of CXCL10 expression in blood and SLOs was secondary to the induction of CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and MAC387(+) macrophages, respectively. Since the significantly higher levels of SIV infection in SLOs occurred with a massive accumulation of infiltrated MAC387(+) macrophages, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and residential macrophages near high endothelial venules, the results highlight critical roles of innate/inflammatory responses in SIVmac239 infection. Restricted infection in SLOs by Δ5G also suggests that glycosylation of Env modulates innate/inflammatory responses elicited by cells of monocyte/macrophage/DC lineages. IMPORTANCE We previously demonstrated that a pathogenic SIVmac239 virus and a live-attenuated, deglycosylated mutant Δ5G virus infected distinct CD4(+) T cell subsets in SLOs and the small intestine, respectively (C. Sugimoto et al., J Virol 86:9323–9336, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00948-12). Accordingly, infections with SIVmac239, but not with Δ5G, deplete CXCR3(+) CCR5(+) CD4(+) T (Th1) cells during the primary infection, thereby compromising the cellular immune response. Thus, we hypothesized that distinct host responses are elicited by the infections with two different viruses. We found that SIVmac239 induced distinctly higher levels of inflammatory Th1 responses than Δ5G. In particular, SIVmac239 infection elicited robust expression of CXCL10, a chemokine for CXCR3(+) cells, in CD14(+) CD16(+) monocytes and MAC387(+) macrophages recently infiltrated in SLOs. In contrast, Δ5G infection elicited only modest inflammatory responses. These results suggest that the glycosylation of Env modulates the inflammatory/Th1 responses through the monocyte/macrophage subsets and elicits marked differences in SIV infection and clinical outcomes.",""

We demonstrated previously that UL24 of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is important for the dispersal of nucleolin from nucleolar foci throughout the nuclei of infected cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of UL24 localizes to nuclei and can disperse nucleolin in the absence of any other viral proteins. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that highly conserved residues in UL24 are important for the ability of the protein to modify the nuclear distribution of nucleolin. We constructed a panel of substitution mutations in UL24 and tested their effects on nucleolin staining patterns. We found that modified UL24 proteins exhibited a range of subcellular distributions. Mutations associated with a wild-type localization pattern for UL24 correlated with high levels of nucleolin dispersal. Interestingly, mutations targeting two regions, namely, within the first homology domain and overlapping or near the previously identified PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease motif, caused the most altered UL24 localization pattern and the most drastic reduction in its ability to disperse nucleolin. Viral mutants corresponding to the substitutions G121A and E99A/K101A both exhibited a syncytial plaque phenotype at 39°C. vUL24-E99A/K101A replicated to lower titers than did vUL24-G121A or KOS. Furthermore, the E99A/K101A mutation caused the greatest impairment of HSV-1-induced dispersal of nucleolin. Our results identified residues in UL24 that are critical for the ability of UL24 to alter nucleoli and further support the notion that the endonuclease motif is important for the function of UL24 during infection.",""

This species is currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir. Multievent capture-recapture models were used to determine the factors influencing bat rabies transmission as this method accounts for imperfect detection and uncertainty in disease states. Considering the period of study, analyses revealed that survival and recapture probabilities were not affected by the serological status of individuals, confirming the capacity of bats to be exposed to lyssaviruses without dying. Five bats have been found with EBLV-1 RNA in the saliva at the start of the study, suggesting they were caught during virus excretion period. Among these bats, one was interestingly recaptured one year later and harbored a seropositive status. Along the survey, some others bats have been observed to both seroconvert (i.e. move from a negative to a positive serological status) and serorevert (i.e. move from a positive to a negative serological status). Peak of seroprevalence reached 34% and 70% in site A and B respectively. On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony. Seroprevalence were affected by significantly higher seroprevalence in summer than in spring. The maximum time observed between successive positive serological statuses of a bat demonstrated the potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least 4 years. At last, EBLV-1 serological status transitions have been shown driven by age category with higher seroreversion frequencies in adults than in juvenile. Juveniles and female adults seemed indeed acting as distinct drivers of the rabies virus dynamics, hypothesis have been addressed but their exact role in the EBLV-1 transmission still need to be specified.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05c420c12deaf16b989b3b6b5b1ce6e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/181a24231f038d1b32d064c30894e5b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0156cdf3c3db33cdb4066a37e6fd8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1eb8a2ec47b88e1e6d6e39afafaf71f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fb81d0d6efae44874af86e7fb146cb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33735207867aaa80897a101787947eed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33ab9934db91026e4d67068c7f756623, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35c988d2d54dd0999d648407ac668d4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ab31b46cc6b4dd54ca69e965ce50c37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bbc401a48b38de757dc910553258f96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cc9f1ae9415fd3fd4881a90e513c971, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58fce4e02caa6a67c38b097bccea2dd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ce0ab953cc394d54b4844aa67f1b79e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68516aa72aca4c74b764f9d5f6bd520d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e158e624c09caf484638da4fdd35fc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7157a6d698ad4f4546a4844c29a960f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/716916f75e374b153a7424b218d0a3ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7aac24f58c4fc2b4986debcc6f36e382, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/847a3ca03efdfcddbedc297d2bfe2d16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c5805ff881d9422965519c8c2b66231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/923cc8f1c187ef84edaca9044a27ddaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b33f759627956341615b7e057e18a00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac2f486384a872cf84c38d023daa5061, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1259d1638db67363cb37a9d2cf41abc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0da35a362e54a84d6c55573784d278e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1b726ec77ef021aba4c29195d029679, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d71b6b306bb55b8189c53b36bdbebc9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d76d601898a7f3a5c31964ca8e95e271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df7b717028e8869eee0ad161528ba5b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f12a54e86038fe7f6f3957090e2be501, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f28705b53fc82e006fdcd25d551d89f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f501ed644e04b07cc914bc7f6eafe100, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7da4524d7279ba5c07a243ff26de803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f838e43caf0467255c01e2ba1e633781, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc58bf1ed3946f188e453c51654ca21b"

IFNα mRNA was also isolated and analyzed by quantitative competitive RT‐PCR. The internal standard was constructed to be complementary to and compete with oligonucleotide primers and for amplification of target sequences. One intranasal application of imiquimod rapidly (1–4 h) induced high levels of mRNA for IFNα, and minimal levels in the control animals. Rapid induction of INFα, and proportional increase of TNFα sustained for 4 and 6 h respectively were noted. No adverse reactions to treatment were found in macaques during this short period of intranasal imiquimod usage (except in one macaque with a short period of lacrimation).

Patients were defined as MRSA-positive on admission when MRSA was detected by surveillance or clinical culture on enrolment. Other MRSA-positive results were defined as healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) transmission. HA-MRSA infection was diagnosed according to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance Manual. The 1st period comprised 415 patients, and the 2nd period comprised 1280 patients. In intubated patients, HA-MRSA infection rate decreased significantly in the 2nd period (1st period 12.2%, 2nd period 5.6%; P =0.015). HA-MRSA infection of all patients decreased from 3.6 to 2.3 incidents per 1000 patient-days (P <0.05), despite a significant increase in the rate of patients MRSA positive on admission in the 2nd period (1st period 2.9%; 2nd period 6.1%). Pre-emptive contact precautions for intubated patients would be helpful in reducing HA-MRSA infection in ICU.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e2ea417239f7166783b35d35dc2faf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e8c6540547ae235bd48c7e9c05929d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16c01fb8959ea8bf035d444f624fb109, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a2e090e84ad081b915d2e951d54a1d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c9a2a0d16c44d140dcc1f1bcf6a62fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d85f2c9c0db60319e89567b0698d2f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39c6ae055a0c7f58f7a5052fdf36f525, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39ed7932e56028908fb164c0396847d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42be40d5aecdbf8532129841f749ecbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47c59cc9682a752b3fc7ff7ab9dd09bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f832362f7f7b30d8222947835ec2b4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/571fc4037ba8ae0897fbe1c6987cbb55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a0b02875d282222516ba28bf0677413, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b621a6bbc043d8eaa21caa0e17d7607, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/600762adb95c1a48cb1a1ac25be8e09e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7404f763e125bb96171d0ca47e7e7e12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7657071440ccd8c82470fa677eef96e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/769733d8e25750ce92080e0beefe8688, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/769f49824880ccd422383bb98cc7d6b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7740215fb005372428f70279527b641c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/801f3991b5279e6f23755498483adb72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/811a52c1eac1b9606c1a9d7158fce38d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a879c5b99fbaeb00ad94a3ca5be371b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98bb9d8a32ee735ac490b317f799ba3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bcf73d27e7f665d282e6302ed8eb3b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a96d3ebe1fe7489acb1d266ba26fa295, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4409817ef7afb92ca1725b9a43717b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8f297a64ab8d17e076f3be54f4f0ece, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcb29196ac0e59381b06c65bc79403ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cde0c1afe6d09a4126775c50efbefd74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d14b61d922e9a3262ad604d213d7bc77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7a3a8557a3f48a3d34c52b5d8ff1423, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbd91785cbc1f3aa6407eefe55048f3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd5f403a26ee44ae8200f26247bd6aae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eeb2e7fd21424fc257e87153952d9d80"

Several designs in cell culture and in vivo have established basic concepts that can assist in the interpretation of evolutionary events in the field. Important information has come from cytolytic and persistent infections in cell culture that have unveiled the power of virus-cell coevolution in virus and cell diversification. Equally informative are comparisons of the response of viral populations when subjected to different passage régimes. In particular, plaque-to-plaque transfers in cell culture have revealed unusual genotypes and phenotypes that populate minority layers of viral quasispecies. Some of these viruses display properties that contradict features established in virology textbooks. Several hypotheses and principles of population genetics have found experimental confirmation in experimental designs with viruses. The possibilities of using experimental evolution to understand virus behavior are still largely unexploited.",""

IL-6(−)(/)(−) and IL-6(+/+) mice of resistant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) H-2(b) haplotype intracerebrally infected with Theiler's virus cleared the infection normally without development of viral persistence, lethal neuronal infection, or late phase demyelination. In contrast, infection of IL-6(−)(/)(−) mice on a susceptible H-2(q) haplotype resulted in frequent deaths and severe neurologic deficits within 2 weeks of infection as compared with infected IL-6(+/+)H-2(q) littermate controls. Morphologic analysis demonstrated dramatic injury to anterior horn neurons of IL-6(−)(/)(−)H-2(q) mice at 12 d after infection. Infectious viral titers in the CNS (brain and spinal cord combined) were equivalent between IL-6(−)(/)(−)H-2(q) and IL-6(+/+)H-2(q) mice. In contrast, more viral RNA was detected in the spinal cord of IL-6(−)(/)(−) mice compared with IL-6(+/+) H-2(q) mice. Virus antigen was localized predominantly to anterior horn cells in infected IL-6(−)(/)(−)H-2(q) mice. IL-6 deletion did not affect the humoral response directed against virus, nor did it affect the expression of CD4, CD8, MHC class I, or MHC class II in the CNS. Importantly, IL-6 was expressed by astrocytes of infected IL-6(+/+)mice but not in astrocytes of IL-6(−)(/)(−) mice or uninfected IL-6(+/+) mice. Furthermore, expression of various chemokines was robust at 12 d after infection in both H-2(b) and H-2(q)IL-6(−)(/)(−)mice, indicating that intrinsic CNS inflammatory responses did not depend on the presence of IL-6. Finally, in vitroanalysis of virus-induced death in neuroblastoma-spinal cord-34 motor neurons and primary anterior horn cell neurons showed that IL-6 exerted a neuroprotective effect. These data support the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a critical role in protecting specific populations of neurons from irreversible injury.",""

To test this hypothesis, we compared expression of the three IFN-β subtypes after infection with a RNA virus, Sendai, versus a large DNA virus, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). Infection of low passage bovine kidney (BK) or established bovine kidney cells (CRIB) with Sendai virus has consistently led to high levels of IFN-β1 RNA. Conversely, infection of CRIB cells, but not BK cells, with BHV-1 increased IFN-β3 RNA levels and to a lesser extent the other two IFN-β subtypes. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide resulted in higher levels of IFN-β1 and IFN-β2 RNA levels after BHV-1 infection. Further studies demonstrated that BHV-1 immediate early and/or early genes were primarily responsible for inhibiting the IFN response in BK cells. The three bovine IFN-β promoters were cloned upstream of a reporter gene construct, and their properties analyzed in transient transfection assays. Only the IFN-β3 promoter was trans-activated by IRF3 (interferon responsive factor 3). IRF7 and double stranded RNA (polyIC) stimulated IFN-β1 and IFN-β3 promoter activity, but not IFN-β2. Relative to the human IFN-β promoter, the IFN-β3 promoter contained fewer nucleotide differences in the positive regulatory domain III (PRD III), PRD IV, and PRD I compared to the IFN-β1 and IFN-β2 promoter. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that virus infection differentially stimulates expression of the three bovine IFN-β genes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/066b6721ac643a1034020a2375f8ca54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1051029784b59303c289b29a01d2bf0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/256734edff83125884042e3be0f8d3f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30f56a62e2f4b0f82aee9335f3e517aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31ef99035deef0ffb1c722e26fe12125, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37b7fdeda9edfc2dd1eac2487d00f17f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f379492d9c6301c660cc1266c28a8c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4902fedb088e1c7e8f49fa5cde7975b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cc800ba93f9eca7e245e462e74b9fdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a64ef60a7b97317085538fbfadeb1ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70b8ddf69ca0927a9b6bcccb5c5e24f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ce2ce906264217a5dd0d9b9414f56df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/991a13b139b351faeda131d0fe1062b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfd99f6080f9ef8c07243e20a570a816, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d106d220fc2db7485187c43f45f8a1d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e62e91008e67c0560748877728cb597a"

The One Health (OH) approach to research ensures that human, animal, and environmental health questions are evaluated in an integrated and holistic manner to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions than would be possible with siloed approaches. However, the OH approach is complex, and there is limited guidance available for investigators regarding the practical design and implementation of OH research. In this paper we provide a framework to guide researchers through conceptualizing and planning an OH study. We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods. We illustrate these concepts through the presentation of a case study of health impacts associated with land application of biosolids. Finally, we discuss opportunities for applying an OH approach to identify solutions to current global health issues, and the need for cross-disciplinary funding sources to foster an OH approach to research.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d34bbb979b916102581237479f36c42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3344c02942c6c9287ab142cd60108f7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4249814bf792450ac7eea6c499622766, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b7bf3f0bcb768f96b01e1d3600e8eb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67f7694e507caa3c03b0193a2237c8c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73a01d9912ab769168982c6a35220fb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c88deb06964ac0675a0bff48c70fdc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84e8aeb02b0e0fe68e6f17ff8a8eb1f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93e5f9a4b594da3b2eeafa921b55dc05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/977e7da987342f3f3b59dfea73faaaab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9af2f4c4536f6acb262b06013e3ee7d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b070160e272ccec5d86c3fb3b74a3100, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5c898ff34aa5beade94af14359c6de4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b76fb0269165383846691caafd6c127d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c336f29df34ff17bc94b54c7cdac3bd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e307cb6d78660d7b54d2897ec9993f83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7d98e7a1d81fdd54c176ad1a5d2f6ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8eb5f2f11b18010ee6b70e43a25d9c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb0d59b975c0416407e754e151fcab39"

Infection is the major cause of metabolic decompensation in patients with IEM. We hypothesized that activation of the immune system during infection leads to further perturbations in end-organ metabolism resulting in increased morbidity. To address this, we established model systems of metabolic decompensation due to infection. Using these systems, we have described the pathologic mechanisms of metabolic decompensation as well as changes in hepatic metabolic reserve associated with infection. First and foremost, our studies have demonstrated that the liver experiences a significant local innate immune response during influenza infection that modulates hepatic metabolism. Based on these findings, we are the first to suggest that the role of the liver as a metabolic and immunologic organ is central in the pathophysiology of metabolic decompensation due to infection in IEM. The dual function of the liver as a major metabolic regulator and a lymphoid organ responsible for immunosurveillance places this organ at risk for hepatotoxicity. Mobilization of hepatic reserve and the regenerative capacity of a healthy liver compensates for this calculated risk. However, activation of the hepatic innate immune system may be deleterious in IEM. Based on this assertion, strategies aimed at modulating the innate immune response may be a viable target for intervention in the treatment of hepatic metabolic decompensation.",""

Since CMt has been detected in the saliva of infected cats using PCR, we hypothesised that direct transmission via social or aggressive contact may occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate this transmission route. CMt-positive saliva and blood samples were obtained from three prednisolone-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were infected intraperitoneally with CMt. Five SPF cats were inoculated with CMt-positive saliva or blood subcutaneously to mimic cat bites, and five cats were inoculated orally with blood or oronasally with saliva to mimic social contact. Blood samples were monitored for CMt infection using quantitative real-time PCR and for seroconversion using a novel western blot assay. Neither oronasal nor subcutaneous inoculation with CMt-positive saliva led to CMt infection in the recipient cats, as determined by PCR, independent of prior prednisolone treatment. However, when blood containing the same CMt dose was given subcutaneously, 4 of the 5 cats became PCR-positive, while none of the 5 cats inoculated orally with up to 500 μL of CMt-positive blood became PCR-positive. Subsequently, the latter cats were successfully subcutaneously infected with blood. All 13 CMt-exposed cats seroconverted. In conclusion, CMt transmission by social contact seems less likely than transmission by aggressive interaction. The latter transmission may occur if the recipient cat is exposed to blood from an infected cat.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0df778d874363afdb3b4ae6867c74137, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c139a09c872098604e83dc20267a9bc"

These groups include picorna-, alpha-, and coronaviruses infecting animals and como-, poty-, tobamo-, tricorna-, hordei-, and furoviruses of plants, totalling 21 viruses. It has been demonstrated that the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins constitute three distinct families, the sequences within each family being similar to each other at a statistically highly significant level. A lower, but still valid similarity has also been revealed between the families. An overall alignment has been generated, which includes several highly conserved sequence stretches. The two most prominent of the latter contain the socalled “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif, with four of the five invariant amino acid residues observed within these sequences. These observations, taken together with the results of comparative analysis of the positions occupied by respective proteins (domains) in viral multidomain proteins, suggest that all the NTP-motif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses are homologous, constituting a highly diverged monophyletic group. In this group the “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif are the most conserved sequences and, by inference, should play the principal role in the functioning of the proteins. A hypothesis is proposed that all these proteins posses NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, performing some NTP-dependent function in viral RNA replication. The importance of phylogenetic analysis for the assessment of the significance of the occurrence of the NTP-motif (and of sequence motifs of this sort in general) in proteins is emphasized.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0793f00b18c27f010cc525b1d39a48a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1137a7151501e74cedc1e274e327f546, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d67b5ff5897c392334c763738ebdd34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/204f4f94b6d3aaf8e90d1a4dfe31aec0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24a6fb05a9afdf73b308084dcc8aafd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b805a1539b259cb2a9d4e8ac8339860, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3876731f715a6615a65e3bf2223189c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/399a08f97dc385a9f9929768dbe1ca84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3eb59cd6285ee09985f1753a37775af1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/402d3b974b53e5b0e9a99bbc63cbdd4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53d5346c86e53e4600e6f95fe9b79d6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53e4eda221bd6ff96b1ba6ff6b5cd18e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5aa727b4da7cbcce2c89ac7bc51906bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bec7265bbd59dd4ffa22a52a5b7ed32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64dc40c680fb9116122a248b2cfa442d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68deb22cd21a4860e2d9c925627c3516, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69265c407f5c485fb0b62af2791ce40f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7527b7a1f7398e718730cec93decbd1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79b374b0388537d481ff0164cfcfee6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85c533a67128d59808993ef06194132c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c3cb27cd38cdd0205323052ea9c2715, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99648252c3d1502699d7cc8169acd31f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9be02a61668d25c4d03a9ddabaae52d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bedc850ec093b5c39e1422b20a45215, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a79852f69b31633f55a3a1d7b7c3b7c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9664c77d2f7f0c558beb0db6a8fe70a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca826f271b0e7bb1f41f5bf9bf0b7710, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d92d531e3702dc0b9dbde73687e8894a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d959580f071267af55357dc49c884e91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eca259c8159867b126b5c6c9856258df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f062d08a160a3646d255ec98d780e8ab"

Objectives: To define the ontogeny and biology of the human small airway epithelium club cell. Methods: The small airway epithelium was sampled from the normal human lung by bronchoscopy and brushing. Single-cell transcriptome analysis and air–liquid interface culture were used to assess club cell ontogeny and biology. Measurements and Main Results: We identified the club cell population by unbiased clustering using single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Principal component gradient analysis uncovered an ontologic link between KRT5 (keratin 5)(+) basal cells and SCGB1A1 (secretoglobin family 1A member 1)(+) club cells, a hypothesis verified by demonstrating in vitro that a pure population of human KRT5(+) SCGB1A1(−) small airway epithelial basal cells differentiate into SCGB1A1(+)KRT5(−) club cells on air–liquid interface culture. Using SCGB1A1 as the marker of club cells, the single-cell analysis identified novel roles for these cells in host defense, xenobiotic metabolism, antiprotease, physical barrier function, monogenic lung disorders, and receptors for human viruses. Conclusions: These observations provide novel insights into the molecular phenotype and biologic functions of the human club cell population and identify basal cells as the human progenitor cells for club cells.",""

HNPs are tridisulfide-linked antimicrobial peptides involved in the intracellular killing of organisms phagocytosed by neutrophils. The peptides are produced as inactive precursors (proHNPs) which are processed to active microbicides by as yet unidentified convertases. ProHNP1 was expressed in E. coli and the affinity-purified propeptide isolated as two species, one containing mature HNP1 sequence with native disulfide linkages (“folded proHNP1”) and the other containing non-native disulfide linked proHNP1 conformers (misfolded proHNP1). Native HNP1, liberated by CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1, was microbicidal against Staphylococcus aureus, but the peptide derived from misfolded proHNP1 was inactive. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension. NE and PR3 cleaved folded proHNP1 to produce a peptide indistinguishable from native HNP1 purified from neutrophils, and the microbicidal activities of in vitro derived and natural HNP1 peptides were equivalent. In contrast, misfolded proHNP1 conformers were degraded extensively under the same conditions. Thus, NE and PR3 possess proHNP1 convertase activity that requires the presence of the native HNP1 disulfide motif for high fidelity activation of the precursor in vitro.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a7fc1200b0faabcf478dcdc0bca838c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a8d848189d8d348db8901f89355b2a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1baaf11799c757d219d72b25029a0e5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21e89a5f30d03bd19043dba9c5d18a53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27cd58641543103de8e96ae670cced85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e667fb9bd5d2c0b7541e2da63c04fbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a681aa58c426c1521010a772075785f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f9e82e7d39572546c2974b38a2d463b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45620cb33e623c16daa95f509cef9312, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b89b411f4fec8644c1f59a92571c649, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62c97a9aa90e96fc27f1476482e39774, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b306e99469b3528fa2ffd83cbc3a5e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ed8004e93153a8a19a5a46e427c3936, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80397a2329e2f622d5cc0499c1e81663, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82e188ba0d37c7c2d3463481d446c6a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8504d0d82a63114e06b8251c79eec937, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f9f48866823335de7f55d892023fdc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/922116779651a62f84f8c7b63441217b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9553071b326f08e473bd17fe1b1e9bc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eb593382fa6324ca543b392d9d43294, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2428e6326fd0a12c1aa92278ca51229, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6ecf9dd935fea2c1194c2de29aeacf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac31105809c1a17864396c6171f9fe4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4aa34e508204dcb1b4c6567254d0655, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4ffdd4c6586baec925ceafe9adcc192, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b94c805ce1aa1f049b1bf7f3f73a3658, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb2f1f70b4f50d782cc2dd4c399bacf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb879adc006862422c0cc73c685e8f95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd658727e3165f8cbe2664286d5ba5fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c445545804bd291d782555213af18a90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d980404080ce9c84dc2a264251d81597, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc10d16d2128bcf85704e255a9d6dddd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd4f40b707f337cd97d9453fa0071689, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0f3b82808aca34dc3dcf4d8cfaec5b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1a212c0cf980b9e609c6e8d9e759493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8bb0c0dd22dcc115eee6f3ae4290de5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9f0d7ea000643ae3aaa04043fd9e4e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed7f9a69447c5f15c54d9ff0ecf7f14a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee02730d751193ea199e1743b1be8239, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f262a2f31a2319eced6045ab8c6dc961, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a573e4069d5cdbc7e24ff84f6a4bf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f39733615126110a2c8e9c420355f1e2"

The integrity of the gut epithelium and competence of adaptive immune responses are notoriously compromised during sepsis, and the prevalent assumption in the scientific and medical community is that intestinal commensals have a detrimental role in the systemic inflammation and susceptibility to nosocomial infections seen in critically ill, septic patients. However, breakthroughs in the last decade provide strong credence to the idea that our mucosal microbiome plays an essential role in adaptive immunity, where a human host and its prokaryotic colonists seem to exist in a carefully negotiated armistice with compromises and benefits that go both ways. In this review, we re-examine the notion that intestinal contents are the driving force of critical illness. An overview of the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system is provided, with a special focus on the impact of commensals in priming and the careful balance between normal intestinal flora and pathogenic organisms residing in the gut microbiome. Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the gut, along with compromises in epithelial integrity. As a result, normal antigen sampling becomes impaired, and proliferative cues are intermixed with inhibitory signals. This situates the microbiome, the gut, and its complex immune network of cells and bacteria, at the center of aberrant immune responses during and after sepsis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f1276e7ca0bb332b4181220c154283f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/115d2b1ac393ece53bf864f059e8cd34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ab2f94e5b75ee84cdc04e5f8413f8a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b63bf6df217dbed91b29005e00047d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39f4da15e656752b651c2bff9e1160bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e975d3c1280a7b66d74ddf0700f5866, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58f356fd352d6c172296d39d28df1a12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/610f81936bdd8a718a07c1add6e166be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c2b6208e7e8886ece16ad238b136564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7da687d6199ef4d30b4604c45241914f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e98dc30805654d0b881b41308d02582, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fe4b6b70deea0d8ba94ad5a2b4c1982, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a58d7162121cc89035771d6a498ca5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9595aef43b7b31392a3609e6ee065887, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b419a52b96033f8de2f36876c42d8dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2297190edcb2407b0864da37c652d6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b42fa14722569d8a255892692a4b892e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7f88e3e71991ac5ab1ffd68732a766d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9599774250cd638d0f2b15a85626c0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca5099515afec73aed55b8f07c53abc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc39fa89ef773a48984ce8e6badd01a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddbdb5ba802bedae07105912130e33cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddfeddfc76584b42652e99f7466a22de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4b7113583ae89907b315bb55a6d3faa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e534715cc02ef4e03257ef41b3486d72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f672f303a2ea56583aa46d9a0a72514e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb07b2b3a40b49cea89ed79ddcb4cae4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd4b6a09942abf68983f88697a6ef8d5"

Two cases are reported to exemplify how feeder swine exposed to points of concentration such as holding areas, sales barns and auctions can play an important role in the epizootiology of transmissible gastroenteritis. A third field case is reported as an example of an outbreak of transmissible gastroenteritis beginning in feeder swine and then spreading to baby pigs on the farm. All baby pigs died that were born during the acute phase of the outbreak in the feeder swine. Baby pigs born shortly after the clinical signs had abated in the herd, and from sows that had been exposed orally to virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus and vaccinated with a commercial transmissible gastroenteritis vaccine ten days before farrowing, survived. This was explained by a combination of a decrease in the amount of virus shed in the environment and the immunity induced in the sows. These observations of field outbreaks of transmissible gastroenteritis combined with recently reported experimental studies lend strong support to the hypothesis of a reservoir for transmissible gastroenteritis virus in feeder pigs. This reservoir would be based principally on the transmission of the virus on a continuous basis from the feces of recently infected pigs to susceptible pigs. Clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis in such pigs are difficult to recognize or absent and this contributes to the importance of the reservoir in the field.",""

Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signaling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of virus-host interactions and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003bf823fca78347249a542377d1961d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0234c23dc71a6a79eb6802288ea90a83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06288f864f1de68eb90a175066a070b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06443715eb0dd9f2061875e573d61905, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16232edd8dcabe5c01b06e0a06ec9c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1835cd24e4cfaf99e55770aa0a4f71f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c4477774ea5ce159c323a589f495006, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2637cc550937b5d39d3d47cfec7c75ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42292c3d7ae021421f262cfb6a4d3d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48cbf1a219574d0909ba7db8bbce34eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b2015b15b019f4961ff359c192fb031, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f42e43529cba28c56c0778d2423c414, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a952f045e58e539b6abbf7ea6905959, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e39c7607d71f96db6e645195ee424c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7db104e0fc6af5ab2481ab042a90d749, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8303e8e4bd6bbf91da92a87c10026c91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/972382180bff274814e74c2f02f2b40d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9a19a8e254d5d91a8b39c7fdaf1436c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ace751cb6b440dab396a1c01c9be2b3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bce2e542d6b73bd0ce7211c838ab2799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c91e68e8ee80495d1bba78b6e9d27ecd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbed3fd9f715601bc29e689de9801947, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d608d3e650398069adec581e3d37cdd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21ac03143d93a32e81b2f91af95eb7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e51c84301eb16e1dd4e3c12ba3a7c92c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec72a1865c988c0c9ade1528fb52cfb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2a2feb9116a5b0d60cdd94984294712"

For the etiopathogenesis of KD, there is no agreement even as to whether KD is an infectious disease or an immune-mediated disease. The epidemiologic characteristics of KD, including the strict predilection of age in all ethnic groups and the gradually increased incidence after the KD emergence, suggest that KD is affected by the immune maturation in early childhood that may be determined by genetic factors, and KD is also affected by the changed environmental circumstances such as improved public hygiene. We postulated that the pathogenesis of KD is a hyperimmune reaction in genetically susceptible children to the variants of normal flora, which are induced by the environmental factors. Using this hypothesis, we might partly explain the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of KD. We expect that this hypothesis may help to determine the causative agents for KD in the near future.",""

METHODS: An Individual Space-Time Activity-based Model (ISTAM) was applied to simulate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical control measures including: (1) refraining from social activities, (2) school closure and (3) household quarantine, for a hypothetical influenza outbreak in an urban area. RESULTS: Amongst the set of control measures tested, refraining from social activities with various compliance levels was relatively ineffective. Household quarantine was very effective, especially for the peak number of cases and total number of cases, with large differences between compliance levels. Household quarantine resulted in a decrease in the peak number of cases from more than 300 to around 158 for a 100% compliance level, a decrease of about 48.7%. The delay in the outbreak peak was about 3 to 17 days. The total number of cases decreased to a range of 3635-5403, that is, 63.7%-94.7% of the baseline value. When coupling control measures, household quarantine together with school closure was the most effective strategy. The resulting space-time distribution of infection in different classes of activity bundles (AB) suggests that the epidemic outbreak is strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. By sensitivity analysis, this study demonstrated that earlier implementation of control measures leads to greater efficacy. Also, for infectious diseases with larger basic reproduction number, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical measures was shown to be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Simulated results showed that household quarantine was the most effective control measure, while school closure and household quarantine implemented together achieved the greatest benefit. Agent-based models should be applied in the future to evaluate the efficacy of control measures for a range of disease outbreaks in a range of settings given sufficient information about the given case and knowledge about the transmission processes at a fine scale.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2acc5463208586a0f80b82de6ae385e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e9b3dbee87132e04b2e51951759d59d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40682f26f00caa0bb59ccf226af14702, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/499cdd4d43ae4acc8c6c352f181bd5c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdccaa41afecb0dae018b8499e333d1a"

These disparate effects elicited by O3 exposure depend, in large part, on the experimental design used, the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied. Despite the apparent contradictions, a general pattern of response to O3 exposure can be recognized. Most studies indicate that continuous O3 exposure leads to an early (days 0-3) impairment of immune responsiveness followed, with continued exposures, by a form of adaptation to O3 that results in a re-establishment of the immune response. The effects of O3 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which O3 exposure occurred. Whereas O3 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen, O3 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen. Although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung, numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that O3 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d73d58d4b7e61bd55f5643fc8c6db70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b38d806e177e873ba5a51f4ff468022, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b299a5a3e8c18fc7dc5c4c9c73405d37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d574b68dd9f0faf4e6e4cc58999421df"

METHODS—Prospective observational study over 1 year set in the Lewisham district of south east London. The daily attendance rate of children with acute wheeze at the accident and emergency department of Lewisham Hospital was related to local measurements of ozone, hydrocarbon species, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)) and small particulate matter with diameter <10µm (PM(10)). RESULTS—An inverse relation was found between the air pollutants and ozone. After seasonal and meteorological adjustment a non-linear U shaped trend was found between incidence of wheeze and ozone. The trend was significant in children <2 years of age but not in older children. In the younger age group, after adjustment for season, temperature, wind speed, and respiratory infection, the incidence relative to that at the mean daily ozone concentration of 32.7 µg/m(3), was estimated to increase by 65% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 22% to 122%) at an ozone concentration of 5 µg/m(3) (1.5 SDs below the mean) and by 63% (95%CI −6% to 184%) at 80( )µg/m(3) (2.5 SDs above the mean). For several hydrocarbons there were significant positive linear relations found, again in children <2 years of age but not older children. For benzene, the incidence increased by 8% (95% CI 2 to 13%) per SD (SD 2.8 µg/m(3)) increase in benzene concentration. A same day association between incidence and ozone was found to be the most significant but for other pollutants a lag of 2 days gave the most significant associations. No significant association was found for the non-hydrocarbon pollutants including SO(2), NO(2), and PM(10). CONCLUSIONS—A U shaped relation was found between ozone and the incidence of wheezy episodes in young children. Certain hydrocarbon pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere when ozone concentrations are low, and are associated with childhood wheezy episodes. However, the U shaped association of ozone on incidence cannot be explained by these other pollutants. The finding supports an earlier finding that incidences of wheeze are at a minimum when ozone concentrations are 30-40 µg/m(3). Keywords: air pollution; ozone; hydrocarbons; childhood wheezing",""

In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China. METHODS: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02ebcdec553861fbdc61bf8ea49d5ae0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1acb2c168e9efe3f1a39954ad85d9aea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27128c29cd6e562e82a49bc89a559228, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/276cbf37700d492360fcd831a46b2ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aa70cb7cc94d557faae46c8e9edc04e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/371ef3448eecd4467e10cc8468db66c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7157c7b4b079360b4fcd9b85e183d77d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/739f8100d6db4f0651583a889608cb35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80c99f776787af1eee9fac746053340e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b844efa56aa9bb6a9be7472ae0d43abd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0bb3665313fc7661b4ddd15ed4d9ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee8a88479c23ebe4fc0acc6ab0073b71"

Weaned piglets were repeatedly inoculated orally with 5 × 105 CFU per pig per day of a streptomycin resistant strain of E. coli serotype O139:K12(B):H1:F(107) and susceptibility determined by daily semiquantitative cultural examination of rectal swabs.

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for immune control of their replication are not completely understood. Here we report that the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is required for control of murine NV (MNV) replication and pathogenesis in vivo. This led us to studies documenting a cell-autonomous role for IRF-1 in gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in primary macrophages. This role of IRF-1 in the inhibition of MNV replication by IFN-γ is independent of IFN-αβ signaling. While the signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT-1 was also required for IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in vitro, class II transactivator (CIITA), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) were not required. We therefore hypothesized that there must be a subset of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) regulated by IFN-γ in a manner dependent only on STAT-1 and IRF-1. Analysis of transcriptional profiles of macrophages lacking various transcription factors confirmed this hypothesis.

We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (108.56 cfu/mL vs 108.05cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. Conclusions The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0608aa7df8cd93173c0b18b1328f3654, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/097f266958e22385538942fcb7c393ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0986a46618d89cee3acdcd4e04133592, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ca26fb31bc6112af18a8c83551bd229, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/148c544b0ccdac39edd85315ab4c3044, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/162a75e0f39627bdb06937661ad89002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d4ba1a96eae3826fba0d346c6778a65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3234c2ad485407b8be65373bf6b2448c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/333ccd5c46972b7b3891ffc8680b1e02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35684be3ee993dd92998b2ba228bf3ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c46d36fed9f5cd966724c9593d3c5f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41b650b6a0f576a01b450abed781c826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c296cff1d20691748d315012f0e68f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51c668ea743d0a04eb5c2f5247727f89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53591746b2124ac73962419fba5d1353, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/614f8f72e551642f94385deb5be9188d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69e98ea1b2da0b787bde6cab81a55edf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75fd638e69b92942999e8deb76fce3a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d4b38e9acc49f9b6a8601f55737deaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81bbaafeb63a281467159d653c2f4e11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83beaaf2cfd0108014234a8c7d9d4960, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87d2119163d926aaffe4045d3063da07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9543ab3736c255f6fea6448cad8de7f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c0a978f626cfca8e039b69ca00a637b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a00ef7d4b96b1c8856495f536615244f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a447f9a78b914022482cf62628e32d5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa75a5ae439ad17ecdd4459c23f679c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ada8a180d5b2bd234f2162f000e24077, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b354004a4bad5a0ee71fcd7aacfd6a3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4a63b73860c694726d422261f1d81d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb72df5d64afd64d531ea4375a80429e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be1bc3dd0267d3bd724ff54621870a3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c118e16e799b228dbcc74d0c7a49d4ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c75c6cb9c349f18c4f99fd5fb12a03cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc02f6298ac95e5d8e89fecf362c86ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5d4cf3ff3dbb10b06d84cd146d4c837, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8e6b5876599f5813c4e0aeb6c1826b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd249eaa0c1a9b7fc1db1db65edc741f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df670ae2e2244c48e40ce58eb67dd2d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eeaf9eb9b661a8a56ff7fa99817d59ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f077786b4218cc7f4e4fee04de7da6a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3a8e5e75bbd6b95fcb09362588d93b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc3c28cf030c54a7afcfd003ba3d70f3"

The hypothesis that a disease has an infectious cause is supported by: clinical features (similar to those of known infectious diseases, e.g. fever, leucocytosis), epidemiology (case clustering in time or location), histology (inflammation of affected tissues, e.g. granulomata) or characteristic microbial structures, treatment (clinical response to antimicrobial treatment), and prevention of disease by vaccines targeting microbial antigens. Proof that a microbe causes a disease requires more rigorous evidence. Future attempts to identify novel microbes associated with human disease may use sequence-based approaches. High-throughput sequencing may allow identification of unique microbial nucleic acid sequences in a background of host DNA. The complete sequencing of the human genome and multiple microbial genomes make this approach more feasible. DNA microarrays are also likely to be used in the search for novel pathogens.",""

Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances. Therefore, treatment with early systemic immune modulators (corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin) as soon as possible may reduce aberrant immune responses in the potential stage of ARDS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/013182084224cfecf192dd3890e85584, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02ace621fe7db66455494512ad054ad1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f7e5b8defd1d2892b0d19a6a5943927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1540827159c790df8a1e31358ea70817, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15d18bb0cd21e4f2766307a1c53c08a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31b2310ba967e480d8c02f4fca3ee7e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39902f1898281fcfd357386e04bb60cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f660c50d275975177a996cf385db248, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/403cce20a181c4f7d402ab10669c5e37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/416ad61d9e34ef554a99031ee7d5efee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43eeb350e55135598c8a2297a3f5808b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e85e53dbf31df9627688b5efe31d7b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5052f03145b9ef31e4bfed7afaeeb8b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57d7ef2c55f62c29bb95a0e07ed55fe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fe05b8e278204c637b7dd74353520cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66d0c51478aea86db55c6553126f336e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f1a2959bfd54fa3a5883af07bde2d38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81105a5d58d31c1ab5bba3f308076383, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86102241358b9c99ded99eb6d935641f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a3d2f09214a6af1e01cb230f08b3925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94c7660855758bd32f397d05774ec552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8722594daa92ad2f383a7b6aee0bf51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b344e181546d858c045bf844988868cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b505d921eb175047235a978b45d0811f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5ef4c6dedc858ba2379540bd6728867, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6e02dd08848a912fb5ed815f4857909, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d90176913c17fea1f28db713f9e2d846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da1a6531f2a865c09b876eb4eb44d0ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21a54c4c27f6b73bea7252156b8fcdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f06f7d3bb37f03926505c65bbc214aa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5c5f52d4a3c0a0002c0b054f502c77f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fac659a7679fbb438198cbea850211ff"

M. haemolytica cells initially colonize the tonsillar crypts in the upper respiratory tract of cattle, from where they can subsequently descend into the lungs to cause disease. Many bacteria exist as biofilms inside their hosts. We hypothesize that M. haemolytica colonization of cattle during its commensal state may include biofilm formation. To begin to assess this possibility, we developed an in vitro system to study biofilm formation directly on bovine respiratory epithelial cells. Using fixed primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells, we observed M. haemolytica biofilm formation after a 48h incubation period at 37°C. Addition of mucin, the main component of mucus present in the upper respiratory tract, decreased M. haemolytica biofilm formation on bovine epithelial cells. We investigated the effects of prior viral infection of the epithelial cells on subsequent biofilm formation by M. haemolytica and found negligible effects. Utilization of this model system will provide new insights into the potential role of biofilm formation by M. haemolytica in the pathogenesis of BRDC.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07d40e360a1ce2845bdb2d94f397b037, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cb8e5ae006af806e699b391f70917bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cf16c1f15e20c12d5299e9ada375c69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e9b3a284f02ab99856035963e0d3f40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a2cc1fb7490f7cea24e11310f1fcb5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/531d49ec574ba515553ba33927ce45d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53b412b948a6e35fe4859f9824bca658, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/570ece885822a163e72046ba6939b29f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c3fe1538b29e9ce62b1fd2709d323f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ea903375db0241609d5df9b5248b461, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f9b318d9dbd4f4aa418a6a90cdbd1f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65fb44d5ec5400a54e31073affb54d09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/726eb24401259a8c717751ee6f542fb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86f123b6c720a2129b8e677eb9d53839, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8784b098fbfea65f51ea790e7a2a02e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8822a106747032caa221348231b0a22d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2033479d7c557e4702f1a3c82097355, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7499be680c1575b39c91c13e3d01b37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb2c9d624f163cf939996d892171a19f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd9d4e679d7d6a971739ebf615979e87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c09461d85978f6b7142e6a91fa8c7e9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3c3bf7fd4aa3719e07e1276b417b696, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdfd4ba2a5202baed8e85eec43579861, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf5df96609e128d72edffbba2cddc020, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d82c348e219419e0a17d36601c433016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb91bae9c3377d91ec414781962012b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7761e82fc1bfcae14e0a11afac014b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa637d735b578b4e9c1951d9e763265b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fba7bd46bbd03e35c41452966a2561dc"

The core body temperatures of isoflurane-anesthetized mice are influenced by the choice of supplemental heat sources; however, the contribution of various surgical scrubs on the body temperatures of mice under gas anesthesia has not been assessed. We sought to quantify the effect of using alcohol (70% isopropyl alcohol [IPA]) compared with saline to rinse away surgical scrub on the progression of hypothermia in anesthetized mice (n = 47). IPA, room-temperature saline, or warmed saline (37 °C) was combined with povidone–iodine and then assessed for effects on core (rectal) and surface (infrared) temperatures. Agents were applied to a 2×2-cm shaved abdominal area of mice maintained on a water-recirculating blanket (at 38 °C) under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% to 2.0% at 0.6 L/min) for 30 min. Although all scrub regimens significantly decreased body temperature at the time of application, treatments that included povidone–iodine led to the coldest core temperatures, which persisted while mice were anesthetized. Compared with room-temperature saline and when combined with povidone–iodine, warming of saline did not ameliorate heat loss. IPA alone demonstrated the most dramatic cooling of both surface and core readings at application but generated an unanticipated warming (rebound) phase during which body temperatures equilibrated with those of controls within minutes of application. Although alcohol is inappropriate as a stand-alone agent for surgical skin preparation, IPA is a viable alternative to saline-based rinses in this context, and its use should be encouraged within institutional guidance for rodent surgical procedures without concern for prolonged hypothermia in mice.",""

This mRNA decay-induced transcriptional repression occurs during infection with gammaherpesviruses including Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), which encode an mRNA endonuclease that initiates widespread RNA decay. Here, we show that MHV68-induced mRNA decay leads to a genome-wide reduction of Pol II occupancy at mammalian promoters. Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape this transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the localization of viral DNA in replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss.",""

For this study, we determined the genome sequences of BYD1 and the S1 gene sequences of other five mammalian reovirus isolates (BLD, JP, and BYL were isolated from different SARS patients during the outbreak, 302I and 302II were isolated from fecal specimens of two children of Beijing in 1982) to allow molecular comparison with other previously reported mammalian reoviruses (MRVs). Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0176df5dae966ca5eda2e90129db7f24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c9a1e3c38f1739b578c8127e51f89de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/247310ec7f849e9ca856834aab2decaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26bd0ff6dcbdcc5358b1069ebbf6fa9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b2c9ea8b32b742d4a62402b5beb8c00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f34957aa8bcb0553343e29baf239846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/425c5e7d3bb6698303ec3459df573d3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c947eb1c9682dbe21aa0144f6359ab4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d32d8726f5d15ec11dfcbd2cd360469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/729694eb7d45b7b70cb4d5bdc2b93dde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d763282eb76242d0a6c3a4e98456536, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82953072fadfa15314c6c4dc1b3f7070, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8824205eb81a3fc28687faf22f9ef320, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0289661f4806fa6a7ed30f8f2fc1348, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c83be23b6ccb2341d18de08c4bdaaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9b5db08d4da8862f7707fe93a464184, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa3cec720824e74e679ca24f749baa2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5af4c9007a5a8d00b24241635d93d83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8f0cb4077191efe095df823278e9de4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8a3c474a7ea24b3e4daf4cd70bf7416, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8acc30e3f416c07b111e184e4a504d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d26cc98cdecb25cb5243a0e9f468168f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5e92c6b0acf5a6fce81fb817ea69216, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbbc523bbfd8ca830984c584194d4cdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5fc4ce5b75e2f55989084ea6610aefd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0df81c0e99b47368aa2d9886c473af4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa7ee820c95846077897f6ad20a534f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd3ea21fd2b91665664c1a92b6e75d55"

Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin domain, >10(5) binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced. Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal Shannon entropies (range: 0.3–3.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1) supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and consensus biases. Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity enables direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders validating an efficient strategy to balance inter- and intra-molecular interaction demands at each site.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/210078219b6dc715cb4db528d172e629, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e84ee1e93beb913a764a56fe61b3ddf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f13de2dd2b34a247cc669cb706020d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47db176ca9559729cc0ce169ba01e945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dd2ca1f3ca08983ec6fff6f25104574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/575b42a17f262c278e92081c2a4c0280, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b0ce3b121063c109cc5b6583fc7ea5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66b3575daf158d4e0a15dd53bd7966c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/711b6a667ee3d370ee5b4121c8aca982, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76627a3c0e8d196d3953ca26e3c5473b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bb0c3e554fd98185398b373d6834d24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d34d34fd1b6f7fd382e11eea122faa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a120783d9559864aa091878a29ed0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90e596e72f5618c73c114516109bf964, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97c4587504c10d50a93c2ff19033c3e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98c3d3759aea2f9e002ea1bad8c2ddfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cd30ab5361fa8178c61c8de865b0838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeb92b5de2fefd377b6321596f824f93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b065234047060aa9d05f76a955f4aa69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8b4957d5b34b41dd3eb8e7a1f0d1953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2168bee1cf3319b6afb87d5c13ccd52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee9d29b4f480b555a4f5573167a129d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f472ceb941a46e889852dd56fb0f2015, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc0dd16d9bf1882c14bad21dab196da5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc3690ede5040bde99eabaedd0e1acc4"

Vpu forms cation-specific ion channels in host cells, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. An understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through Vpu is desirable, but remains limited because of the unavailability of an experimental structure of the channel. Using a structure of the pentameric form of Vpu – modeled and validated based on available experimental data – umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations (cumulative simulation time of more than 0.4 µs) were employed to elucidate the energetics and the molecular mechanism of ion transport in Vpu. Free energy profiles corresponding to the permeation of Na(+) and K(+) were found to be similar to each other indicating lack of ion selection, consistent with previous experimental studies. The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments. A two-dimensional free energy landscape has been computed to model multiple ion permeation, based on which a mechanism for ion conduction is proposed. It is shown that only one ion can pass through the channel at a time. This, along with a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, explains the slow kinetics of ion conduction. The results are consistent with previous conductance studies that showed Vpu to be a weakly conducting ion channel.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/017a2309e51641537e8d29c54e3eece8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04de497192207d99b92529468ee0960e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b8c25c501a50b25393bcd675a97a4d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b4346f0df8f0096f189d0acb7a94681, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c2b059a09b773ed8fd60b237427416d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48060259df60367892050c2dfa9019d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e0a709bb6bae3f496f5f075c121e5bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/500d4d7fadefa0cae55891fce02d485c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55346b8093634b7f884e4e1f62f54d5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cfa02ae5e221755dc896bdb16a1a260, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74f924f2366ed22ad41cede20bb12c42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a81a4fd701d13340ec698ec503a976b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/824bc7a8503ccf42da3a6d4c583e0fd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e02ab1561874a01f32df6f0bcab718e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/913efc9ee259e44aa46b9f384f6476b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93b26806e129cc848df7eef573cdb14a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94e38a9aa0dd28a69185eebac8aa2feb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/969f8c611acec80ccd85570747f345e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cc96d7d1471ea2d200e2656251aa6f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a94acd404b14dacc95f12ee09e1526ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b52714b6059befdef7df9d4ad69760f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b53ba29460c2f140f3027648ae37768a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5af69c5c32b866053336ee17fb2c2c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b90e01530bb064ffedde9ec278d029c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf5a1236bed5d50c149f13e9276e2892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c24ff9ce66833a25825f7d99f6b993db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c84c87a1f1c94f0bb36a7401b7f1f731, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca432ba3739b878dcd77fb02c5f8d24e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd1fb1c20c6f667049e31a52f268288d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2725ba7a70468a21a6fb5b2a1e7f242, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8a9e3f4cb21e945cd5850de52c830a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e15441fde9bdc93a48fc8d4c17d92b62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7227b2784b52c5ec2a9ed0a0cb9682b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eae6ddbe83a214bc8de23b02c0b34b12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7ce764169c959f89160dabbb6c9c53e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9288c0ad37c403e5a0193e32d6e73c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbf8f41ee6f882cef8b544948c9d0eed"

Abundant presence of ACE2 in the lungs, and its impressive effect in the prevention of acute lung injury, led us to test the hypothesis that pulmonary overexpression of this enzyme could produce beneficial outcomes against PH. Monocrotaline (MCT) treatment of mice for eight weeks resulted in significant increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricle/left ventricle + septal (RV/LV+S) weight ratio and muscularization of pulmonary vessels. Administration of a lentiviral vector containing ACE2 (lenti-ACE2) seven days prior to MCT treatment prevented the increases in RVSP (Control: 25 ± 1 mmHg; MCT: 44 ± 5 mmHg; MCT+ACE2: 26 ± 1 mmHg, n=6, p<0.05) and RV/LV +S weight ratio (Control: 0.25 ± 0.01 mg/mg; MCT: 0.31 ± 0.01 mg/mg; MCT+ACE2: 0.26 ± 0.01mg/mg, n=8, p<0.05). A significant attenuation in muscularization of pulmonary vessels induced by MCT was also observed in animals overexpressing ACE2. These beneficial effects were associated with an increase in the AT(2) receptor/AT(1) receptor mRNA ratio. Also, PH-induced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly attenuated by lenti-ACE2 treatment. Furthermore, ACE2 gene transfer in mice following six weeks of MCT treatment resulted in significant reversal of RVSP. These observations demonstrate that ACE2 overexpression prevents and reverses RVSP and associated pathophysiology in MCT-induced PH by a mechanism involving a shift from the vasoconstrictive, proliferative and fibrotic axis to the vasoprotective axis of the renin-angiotensin system and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",""

Although this approach is complete, it is costly and may not always be achievable. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low. Our objective was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. ANIMALS: One‐hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for gastrointestinal disease (n = 65) or for imaging under anesthesia (n = 65) that were hospitalized for 48 hours. Owner consent was obtained before sampling. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy (EM) were performed on all samples. RESULTS: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was PCR‐positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV‐like particles in 9 of 258 samples, parvovirus‐like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus‐like particles in 1 of 258 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that are PCR‐positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/269da0fb0196c4a69e65314ef64d3886, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6784ae586a9a13d46ce1f8288569fcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc4a4f0dc78eab7e5d85abaf6c31ad60"

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We hypothesized that highly immunodeficient NSG mice would support the survival and maturation of O. volvulus and alteration of the host microenvironment through the addition of various human cells and tissues would further enhance the level of parasite maturation. NSG mice were humanized with: (1) umbilical cord derived CD34(+) stem cells, (2) fetal derived liver, thymus and CD34(+) stem cells or (3) primary human skeletal muscle cells. NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.

Local and systemic reactions were solicited, hemagglutinin inhibition titers to influenza virus antigens were measured, and monitoring labs were collected prior to and/or after each vaccination. RESULTS: Fifty subjects were enrolled (34 HD, 16 SD). Mean age was 8.5 years; 63% were male, and 80% were in maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences reported in local or systemic symptoms. No severe adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No significant differences between the HD and SD TIV groups were noted for immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were noted between the HD and SD TIV groups for solicited systemic and local reactions. Since this study was not powered for immunogenicity, a phase II trial is needed to determine the immunogenicity of HD versus SD TIV in the pediatric ALL population.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fafe734c4a68cd1e9bea2706d4176ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25cb8191485c4436c01276c041fde970, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38c96895709a42bf866a391c3efa6fc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/605ff0ed074165fb9555437b39e158d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/720e1222d2df305bfdad1902df3f7344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/774206ba410375d1e6c0e0613fe49ae6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ae4c8ec2a48c961da5611841c6ea973, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/901bf9f9d7747a663abf4f8298bbdd98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93acd7ebd8dc20bd736b920612127b0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5e1698cbe10ed35501cd72ada100a83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8d46b8432371fb95d525b4f1a94989a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af3125c3150851f1972d8aacc7e4298d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2e30b3a9db9cb5e0476f39112ce7cb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e992ade3d01f14d96669433d8a08964b"

The ability of the ribosome to change translational reading frames in the −1 direction (−1 PRF) is employed by many positive strand RNA viruses, including economically important plant viruses and many human pathogens, such as retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, and coronaviruses, e.g., the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in order to properly express their genomes. −1 PRF is programmed by a bipartite signal embedded in the mRNA and includes a heptanucleotide “slip site” over which the paused ribosome “backs up” by one nucleotide, and a downstream stimulatory element, either an RNA pseudoknot or a very stable RNA stem–loop. These two elements are separated by six to eight nucleotides, a distance that places the 5′ edge of the downstream stimulatory element in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit. The precise mechanism by which the downstream RNA stimulates −1 PRF by the translocating ribosome remains unclear. This review summarizes the recent structural and biophysical studies of RNA pseudoknots and places this work in the context of our evolving mechanistic understanding of translation elongation. Support for the hypothesis that the downstream stimulatory element provides a kinetic barrier to the ribosome-mediated unfolding is discussed.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03c132a46a293510f96e25b1d1cf3075, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/091dfacf289f8318e7354f8966028200, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c9107bbb37cc5e8ef743271ebc843ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12d43bdaac30cf0ea52b4a4c9a9e9c37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28bff34b9ddbc8188d9adb7df9477c0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bc4e549bc83890fc36a98ce9332e9cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/452ee3f918cbb8d4ff0dfb09e521037d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47cbbb2f35e10ebb4f1b3a40a1d215ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48e42152c0d3e34040a5ea4ff8b737b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e0002141e522c3469651d1361e7ffd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57c9bd17d4f2a2cd8cb78a68785002cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d04566fc32c5897d83485619757f594, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78a5ff102cb9993fd53757b14a20abaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7dfc9ef1f5811d3b60d51ef5f147c367, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f4d2debabf38548945e1f86e0412aa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/809dc04e33eeb9398052beb3e12f1346, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81c3e57a046981a7f02b08016147bd98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/831049a4f71b36ea1aebf2c014e792e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/931fc0e02001e2ca2f5c6906686df9d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bf8af9bf3d9ced7cad95bcdc4537acc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dc5feac8a785e0baa8ca138254f8cae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0891cb0123d7b8abf8e36a2ce5ad0a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7075ca2c435ea765fa1d17d5ae83318, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a92588663cbadbf83bf8eb73c5e41b71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa8fbd0c7e07527c27415fc113afc4db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5faa795ea1acd75c2ba223168ac90b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5057efc4588c3b6e234679d093ab4f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6bf9f55a4b7dfd42b919bc767313845, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d860987fce9ae3cf77fb72e472839589, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8b8bd632f06c3f4d79a8153ed5152ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd3f170607bc3acbe58f5432f94829d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddee6432397189dd47d73ab422697699, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb820d7333a388d3bf7051ad1253be10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2c362151e1b424ac1bc6031fc57b60a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4747a78c502ade9af3997eafb13b85f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f1105597d992a479c74a98247848b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6013cf93d83e269408a0278c2de75f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f92d7f78d9e9513c089c2dde1c033b4d"

Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02a983cc368a88090e682b6e5d2c5fb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a9fd7865610380437ec697a1342bb2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bbdbe11b9e67fcb0eff3abceb23f900, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1087be989c7e938f629299c46a168b76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/139a0985552383cb343a71d5a59367b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1541dbaf0e8d6bf736e7bc9901f68d7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1804ff2e63f8784641f0dcefa3569079, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18fadfb8bb08c4d2023dc779802426eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/196f8c5b8acb1e1ee53f78d67c08fffa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a6f7271f4acba10b3d4186115f35a49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/212a3323180fa9af8b862c336493f14c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21e01bb035312e6cb50828668f86d478, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/269f6f110dc1b282e9d101e51304d89d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2700fedabbbb9d1a28c01fe4fb8e862e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2769f88676de0f25e648d5bfb7bcf986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29c29cd687f67700c36fc2d43967938e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e67217fed7b47ccf8bbcc21513c4bc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36355dce56c381008c256dead08e5a25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57fa06c14e43bbf8dcbdd212667a13b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cdcf03468277e89713b01f15d01dd68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64bddb10daaf3b7c0ee3ea949656fc87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67c970efcf4e2ca823ce6d1c19c432bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e1a5db6f80a03fda2cca07e3fc628e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70374f3829c52084079aed5389cdf8a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/733bda70ca0b80bd86843454739fcd71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c38704d93c044eae4b2f64f6566e9e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ea31bada5802def206b4d0b53517ec5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80a0d938804d8e42069dbae444089f64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81976f9226ac8e5091a93f473dfe7470, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86a1910e5ac3c057c7d520ccd0ae980e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a35fe2bbc96b78007091fa5fb6bdee9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cd5259afc2b93f5d2fa6d4f34efc25c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fb508d052bb11106c3578cfcaeab9fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9626dbc959009120c54d3e92053eda6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/970b8508f5eb5001b1c919342ae41e26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cc53f4b62f793e53a74030d6e2db671, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d52c4a5779fbe2a83dcb3c08eebe441, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ea7543d82fdffc5aea261d0bcbe5b4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a206d25793858ad76bf752c90f1d5fa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a343c7568a603e6eb5e1a81e16c67d55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a68487725fd338722cf178de56b03276, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6a8af7ab93b60382b1c8ee96f9a6336, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac3f9b45c033a5db0c4a0cc105f16042, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2d190a7fc9a24a5e08b7e6cf522e7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4eb3f1a67bd7df79790a78323052461, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b783597b44c9fb00c4bcd6448d528494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba8ec235f218ddfa6caa6d3940b182bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd433779fac11269c9f1d979e0903163, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd8b14fda3afc3051e03cc2452036c0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d63e23ead709bef5af27c91fabd238c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e67143139d66cfbcfc9fa728d250d836, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e764ed90d85f9d6d84dab5be08b9c8ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e769dc63b3b096f2b693b62b1522ab97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9fc556d2ea25fb5d504a05a38cc9fb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f69d3780e62c829b5c62b064104006aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f97f5e3867afeb6e134dda5b69afa291"

Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression.

Immunological responses against sperm antigens or other elements of the reproductive tract can lead to androgen insufficiency, infertility, or chronic inflammation. Systemic or local immune activation and inflammation directly inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis, interfere with spermatogenic cell development, and may provoke sperm antibody formation. Traditional explanations for protection of spermatogenic cells, based on physical barriers or immune cell exclusion, are not consistent with either the organization of the reproductive tract or modern concepts of immunoregulation. Regulation of immune responses in the male reproductive tract involves immunoregulatory macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as active somatic cell suppression of antigen-specific immunity by anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors, including cytokines and androgenic steroids. These restraints on antigen-specific immune mechanisms appear to be counterbalanced by enhanced innate immunity. Finally, inflammatory signaling pathways appear to play an important role in normal male reproductive function, and there is evidence that establishment of male reproduction during development is intimately linked to the maturation of the local immune environment.",""

Some humans and experimental animals develop both humoral and cell-mediated cardiac-specific autoimmunity during infection. Benznidazole, a trypanocidal drug, is effective at reducing parasite load and decreasing the severity of myocarditis in acutely infected patients. We hypothesized that the magnitude of autoimmunity that develops following T. cruzi infection is directly proportional to the amount of damage caused by the parasite. To test this hypothesis, we used benznidazole to reduce the number of parasites in an experimental model of CHD and determined whether this treatment altered the autoimmune response. Infection of A/J mice with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi leads to the development of severe inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, and parasitosis in the heart accompanied by vigorous cardiac myosin-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and antibody production at 21 days postinfection. Mice succumbed to infection within a month if left untreated. Treatment of infected mice with benznidazole eliminated mortality and decreased disease severity. Treatment also reduced cardiac myosin-specific DTH and antibody production. Reinfection of treated mice with a heart-derived, virulent strain of T. cruzi or immunization with myosin led to the redevelopment of myosin-specific autoimmune responses and inflammation. These results provide a direct link between the levels of T. cruzi and the presence of autoimmunity and suggest that elimination of the parasite may result in the reduction or elimination of autoimmunity in the chronic phase of infection.",""

The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ce057edbfa09182d96b2784e45184e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cb3b580493c8ce811fc03417cd57857, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b6eb7d1d76d214c68bb455d9ebd8d27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c2ad7cc456cf62347d3aa646790c1cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2dd6e14bdd0ee8f1fe8ceb5352ff281e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f2742d3c69eede9b5787cf559d93b35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30c522e7dcc52ab9c7ba66883332aef7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/342bf40ef814ce76b5d08238cbea1046, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35eeb8cf61d7a2854773856fd5fc7fae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/398d8853a1902072e866cb64a976522b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/477837f1d10559638052f55ce37ee483, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49c353bd1cb238e77aeb37b1d142125e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a4b8949d207ed9b47ef9b65252ed1c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c61e97d4643360886eb16e78d3ec89c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b3d2fc70904a789600ac167ed03a758, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80a4759b21b0feda1ff913992afaefa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/889c70c739cb7a30b6b093c843d533aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c2e58f02ea77e78aaf0d3b21a987982, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e5d0f3ce6ea9deba935ce81800c4c71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a2ff78e9c9df688936891a92bfe255, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94d58d4a75713514301fa950370eeb70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96ababe08d68ae6fbaf00cf6b8e29fea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4b83389f00e154b44e93b353cdf87bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4f2c72085531f38920f50c0a23edbed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a832190dcd02a1006d776325840125ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3a2b257059e9385a0d72107b7233151, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba041e766052c96dfa442b1dffccdbee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf4df358aa45c3ccf66f6886dba5f838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e026ade3a24094ce0df3990ecff22c37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e250e9e6def49fb68088e20759bed47a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb8bd17bf536d6430a7e83f509737e27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edca66894d7c526863b2c97697f9b682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0a4f456c72473afcdd0a86f24838c4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8e46db3786231f73d824719c8d83b17"

First, we blasted the whole SARS-CoV genome against a virus database to search viruses of interest. Second, we employed 7 recombination detection techniques well documented in successfully detecting recombination events to explore the presence of recombination in SARS-CoV genome. Finally, we conducted phylogenetic analyses to further explore whether recombination has indeed occurred in the course of coronaviruses history predating the emergence of SARS-CoV. Surprisingly, we found that 7 putative recombination regions, located in Replicase 1ab and Spike protein, exist between SARS-CoV and other 6 coronaviruses: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).

OBJECTIVE: To test our hypothesis that themes of polio-related tweets and media articles would differ by location of interest (hashtag of country name mentioned in the tweet; country name mentioned in media articles) but would be similar to each other (tweets and media articles) for each location of interest. METHODS: We retrospectively examined a 40% random sample of Twitter data containing the hashtag #polio from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015 (N = 79,333), from which we extracted 5 subcorpora each with a co-occurring hashtag #India (n = 5027), #Iraq (n = 1238), #Nigeria (n = 1364), #Pakistan (n = 11,427), and #Syria (n = 2952). We also retrieved and categorized 73 polio-related English-language news stories from within the same timeframe. We assessed the association between polio-related English news themes and the Twitter content. Descriptive analyses and unsupervised machine learning (latent Dirichlet allocation modeling) were conducted on the 5 Twitter subcorpora. RESULTS: The results of the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling on the specific subcorpora with country co-occurring hashtags showed significant differences between the 5 countries in terms of content. English mass media content focused largely on violence/conflicts and cases of polio, whereas social media focused on eradication and vaccination efforts along with celebrations. DISCUSSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, our evidence suggests Twitter content differs significantly from English mass media content. Evidence from our study helps inform media monitoring and communications surveillance during global public health crises, such as infectious disease outbreaks, as well as reactions to health promotion campaigns.",""

This led to the identification of a sequence of 1,300 bases which contained a single open reading frame of 690 bases yielding a protein having properties of the matrix protein (M). It was comprised of 230 amino acids with a molecular weight of 26,376 Da. It was hydrophobic and had a net charge of +8 at neutral pH. Analysis of its secondary structure could not establish a simple transmembrane arrangement of the amino acids. Comparison of its nucleotide sequence with that of BECV Mebus strain showed only a two-base change resulting in a 100% homology between the two amino acid sequences. Furthermore, a very conserved structure of M appeared on comparison with the Dayoff optimal alignment of MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, TGEV, IBV Beaudette and IBV 6/82M amino acid sequences. As the two strains of BECV, F15 and Mebus present some antigenic differences, this led us to reconsider the role of M in viral antigen specificity.

Using model infection systems with pseudotyped and authentic glycosylated viruses, we demonstrated that MBL indeed enhances infection of Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and West Nile viruses in low complement conditions. Mechanistic studies with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses confirmed that MBL binds to N-linked glycan epitopes on viral surfaces in a specific manner via the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain, which is necessary for enhanced infection. MBL mediates lipid-raft-dependent macropinocytosis of EBOV via a pathway that appears to require less actin or early endosomal processing compared with the filovirus canonical endocytic pathway. Using a validated RNA interference screen, we identified C1QBP (gC1qR) as a candidate surface receptor that mediates MBL-dependent enhancement of EBOV infection. We also identified dectin-2 (CLEC6A) as a potentially novel candidate attachment factor for EBOV. Our findings support the concept of an innate immune haplotype that represents critical interactions between MBL and complement component C4 genes and that may modify susceptibility or resistance to certain glycosylated pathogens. Therefore, higher levels of native or exogenous MBL could be deleterious in the setting of relative hypocomplementemia which can occur genetically or because of immunodepletion during active infections. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that the pressure of infectious diseases may have contributed in part to evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05902eb8fabf29a342bf7037a0b01378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05c187a0a168ae0ad65bef38aff24b21,

IBV 3a protein is expressed in infected cells but is not detected in virions. Sequence analysis predicted that IBV 3a was a membrane protein; however, only a fraction behaved like an integral membrane protein. Microscopy and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IBV 3a localized to the cytoplasm in a diffuse pattern as well as in sharp puncta in both infected and transfected cells. These puncta did not overlap cellular organelles or other punctate structures. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that IBV 3a puncta lined up along smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules and, in a significant number of instances, were partially surrounded by these tubules.

Brain-derived cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins are potential biomarkers considering the major role that proteins play in PD pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the current hypotheses about the pathogenesis of PD and identify the most promising candidate biomarkers among the CSF proteins studied so far. The list of potential markers includes proteins involved in various pathogenetic processes, such as oxidative stress and protein aggregation. This list will undoubtedly grow in the near future by application of CSF proteomics and subsequent validation of identified proteins. Probably a single biomarker will not suffice to reach high sensitivity and specificity, because PD is pathogenetically heterogeneous and shares etiological factors with other neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, identified candidate biomarkers will have to be thoroughly validated before they can be implemented as diagnostic aids.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13386b272cccabcb5e9c25daac91e985, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15267db9b0ec7b165a73877c326a69ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15ed6edb62d7a21015a66753efd4d6a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bd2646f302ce6883a9dccd94e49a380, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48a28c30b7098312bad118e8e106f9de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/616f3249a0c876f41b4d611e7e25787a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a2722b89511a95b74613e24db897eec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a66b882863c82574029920fa126b1a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bb2785b19055cb5f550c61829b4e992, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3fc51a87d3bb666fe25ec2c51167893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adcf77c66dfbadcfdb765551adc472a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb7a4311f82545e0f7fa02b9890fbda1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc6ba1686dd63bcaaa6ec1fd3fbc1e16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c93946d12921d4f464eaad9566445aa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e59ec1d41f3cca017d9e7ae376a88ede, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f34455f6e0197822d8db7f9f6bc3de79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7f51a324da6d568af2fe26ca320dfa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcc2d1898fd63ec646148fbc4623dc44"

Current infection control guidelines aim to prevent transmission via contact and respiratory droplet routes and do not consider the possibility of airborne transmission. It was hypothesised that subjects with CF produce viable respirable bacterial aerosols with coughing. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken of 15 children and 13 adults with CF, 26 chronically infected with P aeruginosa. A cough aerosol sampling system enabled fractioning of respiratory particles of different sizes and culture of viable Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria. Cough aerosols were collected during 5 min of voluntary coughing and during a sputum induction procedure when tolerated. Standardised quantitative culture and genotyping techniques were used. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was isolated in cough aerosols of 25 subjects (89%), 22 of whom produced sputum samples. P aeruginosa from sputum and paired cough aerosols were indistinguishable by molecular typing. In four cases the same genotype was isolated from ambient room air. Approximately 70% of viable aerosols collected during voluntary coughing were of particles ⩽3.3 μm aerodynamic diameter. P aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans were cultivated from respiratory particles in this size range. Positive room air samples were associated with high total counts in cough aerosols (p = 0.003). The magnitude of cough aerosols was associated with higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r = 0.45, p = 0.02) and higher quantitative sputum culture results (r = 0.58, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: During coughing, patients with CF produce viable aerosols of P aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria of respirable size range, suggesting the potential for airborne transmission.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08c6140d304363d4335533b7a8057fc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0afc239009fbc5c6b42fe2f1f8956e6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12ba9b74efad1cbf202a128663329b42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14f7780ed6a8caa75e46b23796d79dac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/161c244050feb57c0dbcafba98eb8a07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19f061fab8272b01df00ec8c67f5385d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a9eb347a32c9403fe6910e8f5ad805e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cef54246c7e02a37db194b075614c14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46744416361ae83e3191fa8ddcecf7b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4753cc1f29746b78a16d6befa3aaefec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59abc9eb1e0a9c2f9015af6285937360, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63dfff22dc9d3d28bc74d3e7886d9cca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72804d5616093cfc80f015f01e80c21b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/775a964d689e79f4dd78e75284326638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bf9d9b857e68eda73108c173986b97e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82799a5397d1c4863e62e33158abe29b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82dcbb98fe03f502d22ff3f2225cba6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83e32bfcdea5afec29545cadd731483a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd01420c962438f9e65ae77709688b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91001e1fe5f76c37dd19c14dd523206d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9428bc63ea6122a9016a04d6baf27ca6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8e163f3de802b2f73dfa6f92b09f8ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aabb95baa97c4f55ed5bd711bb626cf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab45a508969bda4d1d726940aa075c56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad1a1095f76de7935db9e69be41bb921, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6004dd5a4b85bd778ed1a770be34ab9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7550efa18c6f0e9b6b76c80aac5f71f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b95d7df648cd30b3f26f142b8c841387, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/badee363152a41c5e614c217e45e3a1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd1782598188c9a083715d0ec1059029, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c59b7ba70fbe6972a576d753f9b0e781, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb0e99ea48f78a795a17894b281d04af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2bd53ed98fe41f731c834e227d2ea10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4688e92f6b3cb0da6ccd29a61d02be9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e890a458710cb518dc84ef9be2ea63dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f07036d231d815b96ebe51b10c6d8099, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc6f5dbdd45a4f168bf59e492dad2221, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd1d792fb2ad4ceb4b6472ded22e636d"

Rats receiving the virus at 9 days of age had an extensive spread of infection throughout the brain and the animals died after a few days. Rats inoculated at day 11 postnatally survived and the infection was limited to the olfactory pathways, hypothalamus, diagonal bands and the anterior raphe nuclei. Stereological measurements showed that the volume of infected neurons constituted 67 ± 10% of the total neuronal volume in the dorsal raphe nucleus.

Pigs infected with TGEV often suffer secondary infection by other pathogens, which aggravates the severity of diarrhea, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that persistent TGEV infection stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) can more easily adhere to generating cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary targets of TGEV and ETEC infections. We found that TGEV can persistently infect porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and cause EMT, consistent with multiple changes in key cell characteristics. Infected cells display fibroblast-like shapes; exhibit increases in levels of mesenchymal markers with a corresponding loss of epithelial markers; have enhanced expression levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-8, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNAs; and demonstrate increases in migratory and invasive behaviors. Additional experiments showed that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways via TGF-β is critical for the TGEV-mediated EMT process. Cellular uptake is also modified in cells that have undergone EMT. TGEV-infected cells have higher levels of integrin α5 and fibronectin and exhibit enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces ETEC K88 adhesion and inhibits the expression of integrin α5 and fibronectin. Overall, these results suggest that TGEV infection induces EMT in IPEC-J2 cells, increasing the adhesion of ETEC K88 in the intestine and facilitating dual infection. IMPORTANCE Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) causes pig diarrhea and is often followed by secondary infection by other pathogens. In this study, we showed that persistent TGEV infection induces an EMT in porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) and enhances the adhesion of the secondary pathogen ETEC K88. Additional experiments suggest that integrin α5 and fibronectin play an important role in TGEV-enhanced ETEC K88 adhesion. Reversal of EMT reduces the expression of integrin α5 and fibronectin and also reduces ETEC K88 adhesion. We conclude that TGEV infection triggers EMT and facilitates dual infection. Our results provide new insights into secondary infection and suggest that targeted anti-EMT therapy may have implications for the prevention and treatment of secondary infection.",""

This phenomenon is especially obvious on a windless sunny day. The near wall thermal plume can drive gaseous pollutants released from lower floors to upper floors. Combined with the effect of ambient approaching wind, the transmission routes will be very complicated. The paper aims to investigate the airflow patterns and pollutant transmission within a building under the effects of wind and thermal forces. A hypothetical twenty-storey slab-shape high-rise building in Shanghai with single-sided natural ventilation is set as the research object in the present study. The intensity of solar radiation on a typical day during transition season is theoretically analysed. The temperature difference between the heated building envelope and the ambient air is calculated by a simplified heat balance model. Finally, the tracer gas method is employed in the numerical simulation to analyse the influence of the wind and wall thermal plume flow on the inter-flat pollutant transmission characteristics. The results show that, the temperature difference between sunward and shady side wall is about 10 K at noon on the designate day. When the source is set as a point with steady intensity and the buoyancy is stronger than or approximately equivalent to the wind, the reentry ratio of the flat immediately above the source can be around 25%.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2608962b7f473ddf350b0ae462836432, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/286ae0bc88a1c7dcb75b1c3b64c9871f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/403229804b3eb0c67a0bfe0e2200633c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43d2a7dc51c6435d137e5f61db657231, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74f9dc151848d0906bcf546530df5cc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/792fcb2045c928c7f11c26696a3fe634, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c650f35aa62306d995613aec6a25a4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d1bd4faec5b50fdb61f3f7b82691455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e52f3a5559cc0b4cac64fe62e799cdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/960de078daa253cc0de336f41ef509dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac3e6f9d5af85f62e42cd511fbc1df15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae2d2f1eff729ae1c8a5d1ac0d620f2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5609801b1e18a1389558811b6942c75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b69e50caa964bced3417538ea21a6cc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d675762186461ca81dc94e112a0f915c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f18bd73ac99461d96c4a2fd799e565a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1f2c5d07a54befc32bb7f421f992d50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8cc21f0024ce5247688af147709adf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fab3659e08dc6b076baec9cd87f4410b"

Despite the extensive efforts taken in the past decades, development of the “ideal” live attenuated FIPV vaccine was not successful yet. In the present study, we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant FCoV pair differing only in the truncation (PBFIPV-DF-2) or completion (PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i) of their ORF3abc regions. In our previous in vivo studies, these viruses proved to show the characters of low virulent or avirulent FCoV phenotypes, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesised the ability of these viruses, as possible vaccine candidates, in conferring protection in specific pathogen free (SPF) Domestic Shorthair as well as in conventional purebred British Shorthair cats. In SPF cats, after two oronasal and two intramuscular vaccinations with two weeks intervals, both vaccine candidates provided 100% protection against lethal homologous challenge with the highly virulent FIPV DF-2 strain. In contrast, the conventional purebred British Shorthair cats did not develop protection when they were immunised with the same vaccination regimes. In these groups 100% of the PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i immunised animals developed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Prolonged survival was observed in 40% of the animals, while 60% showed fulminant disease course. Genetic and more probably immunological differences between the SPF and non-SPF purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment. Our data highlight the diverse immune responses between SPF and conventional cats and suggest a decisive role of previous infection by heterologous causative agents in the outcome of the vaccination against FIP.",""

Most strains of HSV show preferential retrograde transport within the central nervous system (CNS), however. Previous experiments suggest that an exception to this is HSV type 1 (HSV-1) strain H129, since this virus appears to spread primarily in the CNS via anterograde, transneuronal movement. The objective of the present study was to test how specifically this virus spreads in the visual system, a system with well-described neuronal connections. In the present study, the pattern of viral spread was examined following inoculation into the murine vitreous body. Virus was initially detected in the retina and optic tract. Virus then appeared in all known primary targets of the retina, including those in the thalamus (e.g., lateral geniculate complex), hypothalamus (suprachiasmatic nucleus), and superior colliculus (superficial layers). In previous studies, many strains of HSV were shown to infect these structures, even though they spread predominantly in a retrograde direction. However, the H129 strain was unique in then spreading, via anterograde transport, to the primary visual cortex (layer 4 of area 17) via thalamocortical connections. At later times after infection, specific labeling was also detected in other cortical and subcortical areas known to receive projections from the visual cortex. No labeling was ever detected in the contralateral retina, which is consistent with a lack of retrograde spread of HSV-1 strain H129. These results demonstrate the specific anterograde movement of this virus from the retina to subcortical and cortical regions, with no clear evidence for retrograde spread. HSV-1 strain H129 should be generally useful for tracing sensory pathways and may provide the basis for designing a virus vector capable of delivering genetic material via anterograde pathways within the CNS.",""

From biochemical and morphological lines of evidence, we have proposed that Sec12p is localized to the ER by two mechanisms: static retention in the ER and dynamic retrieval from the early Golgi compartment. We have also shown that Rer1p, a membrane protein in the Golgi, is required for correct localization of Sec12p. In the present study, we have performed a systematic analysis to determine the ER localization signals in Sec12p corresponding to these two mechanisms. Both the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Sec12p show the ability to localize the protein to the ER. The effect of the TMD is potent and sufficient by itself for the ER localization and is strongly dependent on Rer1p. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain shows a moderate ER-localization capability which is independent of Rer1p. The rate of mannosyl modification has been measured to distinguish between retention and retrieval. The cytoplasmic domain significantly delays the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the TMD shows only a subtle retardation in the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi but strictly prevents the transport beyond there.

Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease. METHODS: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded. Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry. The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice. RESULTS: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality. These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P < 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05) into the CNS. Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P < 0.05). Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α or cytolytic activity. FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis. FTY720 treatment reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination by restricting the access of disease-causing lymphocytes into the CNS but is not associated with viral recrudescence in this model.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d3ab77e90749ccf6ada3c0857a2cdd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31fa56c604f95db919f7525c0a9eeb0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45a92bf86171eb47b6f620e4c4011c2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49ddabdb666b8ab8a5d120e87747418f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57b3f8601581851c87a2e3a7c4481fbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e33d8472fd6452fcdbb586d0cbdf718, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6037eb923aa3b8c15462da7da2a37497, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a13f4cbb826386c37f274f539bf4ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e33544c9e1a52882f1f7fa98032d105, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/805ffb5eff0018d51082563d9490e7fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/848882d8968a973e35294199bf83ce05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/900bb5fa4654c6aa42860314ed614829, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97d3e4ccfe8552af8b203f738dc0db92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9d93e4332b423fd5a7ac29d1509af79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7a38c169286b91a25db64dbeae6f419, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc405359129dd85c75c83324f8cdc207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd4697e102e0c1edb6b3722ad08be046, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce35f89c58f9fdbbfa25fda898cbaddc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbeb6c80342c1f4f48e9c0efded7ef7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e359e7d5e5fb9c4d8c0c0d09b9787a67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd18e1c63369c4e5480f1af01f525cc7"

Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIV–SIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained. This survey also provided clues that silent codon changes, in particular from G-to-A, determine the subtype-specific sequence signatures.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04dfc68f8e3a018aef9054b61c053886, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44e0bbdc508932853ed3e03559688349, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/498ea7be4dcaccee47506742c7f6876b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51f9e3497aba55830883de58ab27f020, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5727c7af123b122a8ae5d486a29a0572, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/657d09460a24a229730fef04fb915222, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88dfafb943faa94765e67d1a692a1e25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a55a4be41255af036d86500a39dabb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b14f521beeb70fbd5130fea8496d0dd9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6eb9e02948d1c9c6ea5aaa34c5bda78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb7284cc6563ecd29488de3556d26e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4a5fc2737c742afc01375e7866c2686"

Little is known about the pathology of these animals and few articles have been published, mainly concerning their important role as wild reservoir hosts for severe infectious diseases of domestic animals and human beings. A 4-year-old, female Asian palm civet was found dead by the owner. At necropsy, large amount of adipose tissue was found in the subcutis and in the peritoneal cavity. Most of the pancreas appeared red, translucent. Hepatomegaly, discoloration of the liver were evident, with multifocal areas of degeneration, characterized by white nodular lesions. Histologically, the pancreas showed severe interstitial and perilobular necrosis and extensive haemorrhages, with separation of the interstitium, mild reactive inflammation at the periphery of the pancreatic lobules. Liver showed multifocal foci of vacuolar degeneration, lipidic accumulation, sometimes associated to hepatocyte necrosis. A diagnosis of acute severe hemorrhagic-necrotizing pancreatitis (or acute pancreatic necrosis) associated with pancreatic and hepatic lipidosis was made. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first case report of acute lethal pancreatitis in an Asian palm civet. Although the exact cause of the disease remains undetermined, a hypothesis of the cause and pathogenesis is discussed, pointing out dietary indiscretion and consequent overweight as possible important risk factors.",""

We hypothesise that foreskin tissue samples of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive men had remaining signs of inflammation at the molecular level. Even in the absence of clinical lesions, genital inflammation may contribute to increased HIV susceptibility on sexual exposure to the virus. SETTING: Foreskin tissue samples were collected from men undergoing elective circumcision in Kisumu, Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: The foreskin tissue samples (n=86) were stratified into study groups based on HSV-2 serology and assessed for mRNA expression of inflammatory markers. Markers of interest were further assessed by immunohistochemical staining within the tissue samples. RESULTS: The two study groups had comparable levels of all molecular markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CCR5, HLA-DR, Langerin, DC-SIGN, Mannose Receptor 1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, β7, IgA, IFN-α, CCL5, E-cadherin, ZO-1 and occludin), except for lower mRNA levels of the epithelial junction protein claudin-1 in the HSV-2 seropositive group (p=0.008). Although mRNA levels of claudin-1 were lower in HSV-2 seropositive individuals, the corresponding protein could be visualised in the foreskin epithelium of all samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas no general inflammation was demonstrated in the foreskin of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive individuals, a decreased expression of claudin-1 indicates a less robust genital epithelial barrier. An intact epithelial barrier is essential for blocking mucosal entry of genital infections, including HIV.",""

It has been hypothesized that some features of their innate immune system may enable bats to trigger an efficient early immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a first line defense within the innate immune system and lie directly at the host–pathogen interface in targeting specific microbe-molecular patterns. However, the direction and strength of selection acting on TLRs are largely unknown for bats. Here, we studied the selection on viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 based on sequence data of 21 bat species. The major part (63 %) of the TLR8 gene evolved under purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. We also found evidence for persistent positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites (7 %), especially when compared to viral TLR evolution of other mammals. All of these putatively positively selected codons were located in the ligand-binding ectodomain, some coincidenced or were in close proximity to functional sites, as suggested by the crystallographic structure of the human TLR8. This might contribute to the inter-species variation in the ability to recognize molecular patterns of viruses. TLR8 evolution within bats revealed that branches leading to ancestral and recent lineages evolved under episodic positive selection, indicating selective selection pressures in restricted bat lineages. Altogether, we found that the TLR8 displays extensive sequence variation within bats and that unique features separate them from humans and other mammals.

It has been proposed that peptides having propensity to interact with membrane interfaces might exert broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses. To test this hypothesis, in this contribution we have analyzed the antiviral effects of peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region and the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41, which display different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity. Our data support the virucidal activity of a region that combines hydrophobic-at-interface membrane-proximal external region aromatics with hydrophobic residues of the transmembrane domain, and contains the absolutely conserved (679)LWYIK/R(683) sequence, proposed to embody a “cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus” motif. We further sought to correlate the antiviral activity of these peptides and their effects on membranes that mimic lipid composition and biophysical properties of the viral envelope. The data revealed that peptides endowed with virucidal activity were membrane active and induced permeabilization and fusion of virus-like lipid vesicles. In addition, they modulated lipid packing and miscibility of laterally segregated liquid domains, two properties that depend on the high cholesterol content of the viral membrane. Thus, the overall experimental evidence is consistent with a pattern of HIV inhibition that involves direct alteration of the physical chemistry of the virus membrane. Furthermore, the sequence-dependent effects observed might guide the development of new virucidal peptides.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02253e6f06af52aab4c9487497d257b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02ce4f0b23979b89176e330b95ee1ae6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/084517c99b4aaaa1aee4af2cf5cf18ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1863b46e016f33fa67ecc291b71d2374, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e61bd5618d0dd834f12750eb4d2439, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bbe428c6495d08bb76ac2f57c6403f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c1b5286a341930704c4d41107a91fc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37dd2ae068de10f94353fbb300202d2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/398edf1d7d9d6576e7d57e7778c8f2a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a4c603930752131079f07fd1685b682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ce08f3a493c27cd715244977b2cdbe0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/419e8d39a28b515dff185c1d68a02603, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44f0a736aee2970f4e5ab5b6d58c1532, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5496f4e53d58887924746d25f4df98fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5588c6d0f9108421f6d24ed472897465, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5638d46ac7bcbd82b04a0e6fe92f3bd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/569f4f494bafac5c817250a2ecccfaa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/585d2cd92e8fa04093ec2142aead3e8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b44e9614f81d6921dadefc7f995bab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60ac34e862759cfe861a14697b5add17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/626bda999681d44a5165cf2e90a822fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/681f247c4a045d0bc4d89db5d7468488, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69b3cefb30e87f030abaed1dfd4d5d18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d6518fd228e00761bfdc3266cdbfe06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/786a1628ca564a23028c7f40f559705f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a481576569c12b52ca24a9707073603, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8004670c48f291b22c45b38a28015351, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86ac058803bde383588cf01b1a096a08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89f75831c0baa602b10a17f7fed9d5a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8be5cd62d266914043fffb6064cc488a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f1ae58bb56669d826e147eef1e75898, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fe82ae311063ae09ff2013f4374d5a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/933bd0ca74c2a11d92e4b25f12a6075a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad9886eec7451179d01da8d242591555, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c687c022660aca0f14e2038421f55541, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce01f4e43993ce2328d08d01690e3373, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d50ba942cae09efd41e2ba19469ebf06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dffdd24e6709d7f097dd26af9ae1080f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e36c14a92d69fd3ea8f63d2f4f25a82d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6993a91c20babe8c9ffe92bdab06b4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7fe6d13fe3b11d7f49799126feebf5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b1cb648e2bd292adbb672e435e4fc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f332d78914e350b10f965941b0f1a7a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffe4347e5628c9b5d0e77c60bfdb9128"

This deleterious disease is marked by infiltration of myelinspecific T cells that attack the protective myelin sheath that surrounds CNS nerve axons. Upon demyelination, saltatory nerve conduction is disrupted, and patients experience neurologic deficiencies. The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens, such as viruses, as potentially key contributors to MS induction. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well-studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry occurs when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross-react with self-epitopes, leading to autoimmune tissue destruction. In this review, we discuss an in vivo virus-induced mouse model of MS developed in our laboratory, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry-induced CNS autoimmunity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ea56c4ae14660a28abaf80e384f6e2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/124a7c2b6292468d4159e64bd39cf987, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14388fbff4c7dd98420fe64b9ba1ccab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19800fb73b200bd5708cb573afbac033, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38ec5ecaae408e92e6e416cb0bdcce3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/476789947b4bef7b94de35ba1cdf73db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5109738f8b00d64eaa68d3ef6380efbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/526729cfd651b4cd5542b7f162357a52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dab5db7ed558a0df7f54c7545fde24e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/669de288e65bb1218c5a251e49a56e2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/678796ae3fa4637ab1164d0fb47d401d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e169681f51a49bce65b869538be65f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/926e49107e6221b35676a4c563fe840b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1f6589c48bb558c3a3d516528784db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7da1b1750d0648512821bb4ac7f62c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4cb660e75bd91848c79302aa715b889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5724777df257d60ae8ecd89eb477c2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcae6c795ed06417ea8863b017565882, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c756f5806e2dde180b7ffeba66fb8aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d68ec7035099e7db5880ce983aebe31b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d79afc66ef74d1c982adc0cd5be62b72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e66c06c16993454d31e3e655926b975d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d74378c5611e6ebf6f62f64c68921b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efd3d85881d01bf0e5a7a1466a1a5a36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2c18924fb24c36446de43f4a983bf04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fab975d70869edcdbdb7d242a71023fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffbcca3ce8f61006aec17e1a3e27d7a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffeb508355b2e1009f34589e132a4b81"

Schematically, effector T cells specific for self-antigens exist normally, but their activity is modulated and prevented by networks of regulatory T cells. As a result of mimicry between molecular components of microorganisms and self-antigens, autoimmune disease can be triggered by specific foreign pathogens which alter the state of activity of the network from suppression to activation. Conversely, by a procedure known as T-cell vaccination, autologous effector T cells re-injected after in vitro stimulation and attenuation may alter the state of the network from an activation to a suppression. Numerous observations are reviewed that support the concept of autoimmune activity in the destruction of non-infected T4 cells. Such activity is presumed to be triggered by an antigen of viral origin, the most likely, but not the only one, being the envelope protein gp120. Based on this hypothesis, a T-cell vaccination procedure against effector T cells responsible for autoimmunopathic activity in HIV-seropositive patients is proposed, similar to the one known from experimental study of autoimmunity and presently being tested in human autoimmune diseases. Its purpose would be to prevent T-cell loss and the onset of immunodeficiency disease in HIV-seropositive patients. Apart from its potential therapeutic value, this procedure will have use as a therapeutic test from which insight will be gained about the immunopathogenesis of AIDS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a356b37d85d67da0f766d825e2af382, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1eaf0ec63cdc057e1e5dee310b639767, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/200920939d6da3b49bb5aed1446fe328, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/315a5b4308ea5c080dfdba7b1584e7fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60c4714a520991b66d5336b0be4ed624, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6aa7b212c8c434b462b4f4b0a6f078df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/760d197c35419d262131bf0816290454, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d4d090591a0b0f320cbd49274ef186f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85e24215ffdb1180bea0f25eb6c124f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/917cd4ebc1bab19c9f27d11c32ead082, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b39abcc9fddc1fdd88083a8faccaea55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c97d0bdcf5ed599054d2941f86988126, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6bd14feaf8707132f52b9ad546951a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef06c51f9beb204d40e64dd7b757cdd5"

The psychological behavioural patterns of the family were as follows – creativity and high IQ, hypersexual behaviour, reduced appetite and eating behaviour, insomnia and reduced sleep patterns, increased tendency for spirituality, increased tendency for addiction, less of bonding and affectionate behaviour and left handedness. Digoxin, an endogenous Na+–K+ ATPase inhibitor secreted by the hypothalamus, was found to be elevated and RBC membrane Na+–K+ ATPase activity was found to be reduced in all the disorders and in the indexed family studied. Hypothalamic digoxin can modulate conscious perception and its dysfunction may lead to schizophrenia. Digoxin can also preferentially upregulate tryptophan transport over tyrosine resulting in increased levels of depolarising tryptophan catabolites – serotonin, quinolinic acid, strychnine and nicotine and decreased levels of hyperpolarising tyrosine catabolites dopamine, noradrenaline and morphine contributing to membrane Na+–K+ ATPase inhibition in all the above disorders and the indexed family. Digoxin induced membrane Na+–K+ ATPase inhibition can result in increased intracellular Ca2+ and reduced Mg++ levels leading to glutamate excitotoxicity, oncogene activation and immune activation. Digoxin induced altered Ca++/Mg++ ratios, reduced ubiquinone and increased dolichol can affect glycoconjugate metabolism, membrane formation and structure and mitochondrial function leading to the diverse disorders described above including those in the indexed family. The isoprenoid pathway and neurotransmitter patterns were compared in right-handed/left hemispheric dominant and left-handed/right hemispheric dominant individuals. The biochemical patterns in the indexed family and the diverse disorders studied correlated with those obtained in right hemispheric dominance. The hyperdigoxinemic state indicates right hemispheric dominance. Hypothalamic digoxin can thus function as the master conductor of the neuroimmunoendocrine orchestra and co-ordinate the functions of various cellular organelles.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/069b21c3892858647d87a21996daec18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/091e564f4cf54d8daa8a8d35c4d67a4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ae9f937725e4a149392559d30599106, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c0d3bae41847ca9af97a597cbb3e195, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d164cc53cf535cac0527b4cfaac8b04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e55a12acc7e5de0e7907d6a13cec415, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/111d150482d0c2d4fd4d4a7756ffeeb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14c55922d49a6cf436f027338a8e1273, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c67016786357eb312008fee1956d773, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f2cf9943d8367002905d81ab03817e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2125d62fb50a71ca61b32350d5d7b169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/289bef699967b7eb5e50edc270d4e7fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e9b4dffdf65c63eccca26b738aa7dbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34f07c5e974e12a23b4dfc4790bec47e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/357fb4bb8dd5061637110324d16c561b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f623e290090897e22815ebe1815ac1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42a6815e616a6832d1bc048b3d4903b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/558e77643bd7301bbc4fc2d14cba4a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/602499d8f733e7a88c52e2c854494ab9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6780bb568cc2f91cdb18654cdff76ab8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a926a8407f1ec0056d8903b5eb64df1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f356f677ce1db15231a5f610c54b751, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7041b9d5a31b6e4e7f62f0fd657644f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74605c46a7a8a61357d77a716d0b7c06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/754ab5bde76a32a97c5b7d03b2633b97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79485ebea7fe1a932a6bb311b30d3b4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7eedbe4ddaa9a2bced2efaf95176ff67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80d837689e932ba0981e0707ee694c88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8770577579d8995293c7fe5ade8b3b2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/887d746b7cc44a45934d5cd281f5b1c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b4e6ca4652b9c2ff32913a81e04b7c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c0bdcbcc443a3a73de0379e0f2ca2e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c205c5832281472b6c5f71b5ffe0c0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d765a2db154e02bdfaaecc6dbf4aa5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d8a83782c71c1c58be25748a4d4045, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bc8e3f2139c7697bc090533f2051b9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dbbe47a101306a1697be541f99b632d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fd8ad194a13dcf4ffc38dd7a4cbf2cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3840da23ffb8fc5dcf8279f87a7fda8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6717dd50d6542737762713c2f11a19e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6c1f75eb0ebf3d9374bfc0764047f02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a774394e31d8b4fa3a2dcc5df498d407, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b098ab4d3fd27c94fbdf0b9bcc6eac7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2e6bdd978a3dc988aeb5e09135d187f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcb4f0b0dacd6610287c4937d1518ad0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be02a8a11b3cb69f4d229787107cc0ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfaaa32dfbc88f7fcee11cd825f1e95f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c173470e1328aa9ac54ecbdbc2eb3694, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1d458d36c620abd048cea6a453f598e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3af20c9540584fb11abcbb1370546b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3b8ced6a6b8384ea6009c8753d6a3a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c612150bcab2fbfe064c69353d97c86b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce63bac68353e11b3f164db23216fb6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d43971bc78f302f39e4041de197e8cdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da946ea3b9fee87962a5de1d87d2b575, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db496f753d1bc60a142eb3401c679257, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc173c9d614916c2ee8d65c84d2f5a46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e47eec150ff5cac9bf5cc321f65bd825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4841141dcacc2e4bcaab37f2261cf2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7e0571da5f5160d8f42ebb86f405706, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8c7e034390fc57a2dcd818b8518e20f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0c340b119c8d5d4e5f12fbcaacf7f38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1aa0cb4e514450cc444def696a3e5bf"

Our patient reported playing football, along with upper respiratory infection symptoms, prior to presentation. Extensive infectious and toxicology workup was negative; however, several inflammatory proteins were markedly elevated. We hypothesized the large inflammatory burden led to an increased reactive oxygen radical burden that overwhelmed muscle and erythrocyte reducing power. Severe rhabdomyolysis in G6PD deficiency is not a common presentation because skeletal muscles are more resistant to oxidative damage compared to red blood cells.

However, increasing sectors of the population have expressed hesitancy about participating in such programs, leading to the re-emergence of vaccine preventable diseases. In this study we rely on a recreancy hypothesis to test the association between confidence in the government and local hospitals and the willingness to take the vaccine. Methods A secondary analysis of a survey that used a large sample of the U.S. population conducted in October 2009 was used (N = 968). Results The results indicate that 36.1% of the respondents expressed willingness to be vaccinated. Those with the greatest trust in the government were the most likely to be vaccinated (43.4%), and those least confident were the least willing (15.8%). From the ones reporting being confident in the local health system, 38.4% were willing to be vaccinated, and from those not confident, only 23.5% were willing to be vaccinated. Conclusion The decision to get vaccinated in the midst of a contagious outbreak involves many considerations. Trust in the government's technical and organization skill to deal with the infectious outbreak along with trust in medical organizations predict the adoption of recommended protection measures. The results indicate that public compliance with vaccination plans in health crisis requires the development of social and institutional trust.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36ec234e0849a6882344b05af5664eab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2da71d6b4cc275655ce1471841b8123, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e69ca0a58e4260b7058e6feb9fad6fba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e91db50ee5a39eb41ebf26aba450e2e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc86e8f576c3e944409f7cc44cf1e1c6"

We tested this by analyzing the site of budding of four different coronaviruses in relation to the intracellular localization of their M proteins. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) grown in Sac(-) cells, and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) grown in CrFK cells, all budded exclusively into smooth-walled, tubulovesicular membranes located intermediately between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, identical to the so-called budding compartment previously identified for MHV. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of the infected cells showed that all four M proteins accumulated in a perinuclear region. Immunogold microscopy localized MHV M and IBV M in the budding compartment; in addition, a dense labeling in the Golgi complex occurred, MHV M predominantly in trans-Golgi cisternae and trans-Golgi reticulum and IBV M mainly in the cis and medial Golgi cisternae. The corresponding M proteins of the four viruses, when independently expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus system, also accumulated in the perinuclear area. Quantitative pulse-chase analysis of metabolically labeled cells showed that in each case the majority of the M glycoproteins carried oligosaccharide side chains with Golgi-specific modifications within 4 h after synthesis. Immunoelectron microscopy localized recombinant MHV M and IBV M to the same membranes as the respective proteins in coronavirus-infected cells, with the same cis-trans distribution over the Golgi complex. Our results demonstrate that some of the M proteins of the four viruses are transported beyond the budding compartment and are differentially retained by intrinsic retention signals; in addition to M, other viral and/or cellular factors are probably required to determine the site of budding.",""

A model described recently by Sawicki et al. (S. G. Sawicki, D. L. Sawicki, D. Younker, Y. Meyer, V. Thiel, H. Stokes, and S. G. Siddell, PLoS Pathog. 1:e39, 2005), based upon complementation studies of known temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59, proposes that an intermediate comprised of nsp4 to nsp10/11 (∼150 kDa) is involved in negative-strand synthesis. Furthermore, the mature forms of nsp4 to nsp10 are thought to serve as cofactors with other replicase proteins to assemble a larger replication complex specifically formed to transcribe positive-strand RNAs. In this study, we introduced a single-amino-acid change (nsp10:Q65E) associated with the TS-LA6 phenotype into nsp10 of the infectious clone of MHV. Growth kinetic studies demonstrated that this mutation was sufficient to generate the TS phenotype at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the TS mutant variant of nsp10 inhibits the main protease, 3CLpro, blocking its function completely at the nonpermissive temperature. These results implicate nsp10 as being a critical factor in the activation of 3CLpro function. We discuss how these findings challenge the current hypothesis that nsp4 to nsp10/11 functions as a single cistron in negative-strand RNA synthesis and analyze recent complementation data in light of these new findings.",""

Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets—the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli—speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1(HXB2) replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1(NL4-3) containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1(NL4-3) Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1(NL4-3). HIV-1(NL4-3) variants were capable of CD4(+) host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1(NL4-3), but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle. We currently reveal that viral integration is deregulated in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0473a2f494e9a0719eb9a3ceb7b9680c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06cabcb5de5671bcc5a57a8be89501b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e9f5994f7be2737d2692fa48c154579, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17f2fdb643d7cb31137dbd779ad1fc8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2524523b824a512f802ef8203d8b47c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/332ad53ae1af11133d59e541b3685a22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f88216de25b27283bcabc5becc7ffe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40582b595f8a280931d7c4c8db20ab48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/571ed54260c77caa654f5827a648413c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5855a895f50d1065f8b62b4d9ef3fd0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fdf72d25e6ecbb8a39bee2efb5dd202, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64d0adb9fe8df749ede61383ab0af1e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6652b0aeba04404f36aa4679e949ae75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/675f543f76c4f8edf3923bab821309f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71a07387ee822dceaaec91042fef1406, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76fa979096a26119b858f34b1ce10742, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77535ff2fcd7253879c398d87a678b15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b54b937a2962d218ff7ffa1a4ecb472, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84171ad9bf02c4a9f75661c41d40d121, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a13714b32cc75e1eb94cc1ebc3d25a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a2d830ce3dfb4869c85f2c6b1bbc924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919b3b3bca1c4a3ab59f3732ce96d820, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99dcf5f4e292ea91d1d638fc2be9bf8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a07f46a2d06682352102f30fe3269be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aef30992731836ba1dedff922034a1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ce14cc01d82030f91c360ec6030e2d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a842da774399384d423091a2453a83b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b810f929a8456d6d000e52a2519ac30a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b94765989edcbf2b26b7b239efd2eb6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9fa0e2ab115ac56c31fd59c48f08393, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba5be39e407a7b43ffc0a073425b6a37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb59bd86e7c51f2126eed5bc110ae66a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb780aae80682a4183e8f44cbb5083a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb9122d36aedee33acf58d3e98f54c21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c043d2fcbb133aef496c96c7cd2f2438, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c14ac0bd1e4484e3fafc392164d672db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3546a9ccb0ed087973dde1ba91c06a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c46a290d2dd291f95a9e96219118f6e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5ddfc67eb39a77cae57faec6b2eeb1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c671ed2b18f2ed47f28feb74e407dd17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d59c8d07a666026b6e298d8aefab2f09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e224a70c7dd9bb9c7d679691e1f80dc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3168bf56d03b80af791f0bf3013d922, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec34417c1d06012f04954684b6435184"

It remains unclear whether certain types of cases were more likely to cause secondary infections than others, and if so, why. METHODS: Publicly available demographic and transmission network data for all cases were collected from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relationship between demographic characteristics and the likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Findings from the statistical analyses were used to inform a hypothesis-directed literature review, through which mechanistic explanations for nosocomial amplification were developed. RESULTS: Cases that failed to recover from MERS were more likely to cause secondary infections than those that did. Increased probability of direct, human-to-human transmission due to clinical manifestations associated with death, as well as indirect transmission via environmental contamination (e.g., fomites and indoor ventilation systems), may serve as mechanistic explanations for nosocomial amplification of MERS-coronavirus in South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to closely monitoring contacts of MERS cases that fail to recover during future nosocomial outbreaks, potential fomites with which they may have had contact should be sanitized. Furthermore, indoor ventilation systems that minimize recirculation of pathogen-bearing droplets should be implemented whenever possible.",""

The zoonotic Hendra virus (HeV), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, utilizes the attachment protein (G) and the fusion protein (F) to perform these critical functions. Upon triggering, the trimeric F protein undergoes a large, irreversible conformation change to drive membrane fusion. Previously, we have shown that the transmembrane (TM) domain of the F protein, separate from the rest of the protein, is present in a monomer-trimer equilibrium. This TM-TM association contributes to the stability of the prefusion form of the protein, supporting a role for TM-TM interactions in the control of F protein conformational changes. To determine the impact of disrupting TM-TM interactions, constructs expressing the HeV F TM with limited flanking sequences were synthesized. Coexpression of these constructs with HeV F resulted in dramatic reductions in the stability of F protein expression and fusion activity. In contrast, no effects were observed when the HeV F TM constructs were coexpressed with the nonhomologous parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) fusion protein, indicating a requirement for specific interactions. To further examine this, a TM peptide homologous to the PIV5 F TM domain was synthesized. Addition of the peptide prior to infection inhibited infection with PIV5 but did not significantly affect infection with human metapneumovirus, a related virus. These results indicate that targeted disruption of TM-TM interactions significantly impact viral fusion protein stability and function, presenting these interactions as a novel target for antiviral development. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses require virus-cell membrane fusion to release the viral genome and replicate. The viral fusion protein triggers from the pre- to the postfusion conformation, an essentially irreversible change, to drive membrane fusion. We found that small proteins containing the TM and a limited flanking region homologous to the fusion protein of the zoonotic Hendra virus reduced protein expression and fusion activity. The introduction of exogenous TM peptides may displace a TM domain, disrupting native TM-TM interactions and globally destabilizing the fusion protein. Supporting this hypothesis, we showed that a sequence-specific transmembrane peptide dramatically reduced viral infection in another enveloped virus model, suggesting a broader inhibitory mechanism. Viral fusion protein TM-TM interactions are important for protein function, and disruption of these interactions dramatically reduces protein stability.",""

It will be shown here that, alternatively, the epidemiology of the influenza lethality could be completely explained by a combination of two determinants: (1) acquired immune-differentiation of birth-cohorts, within populations, through developmental epigenetic adaptation (and selection) secondary to maternal or early-life episodes of influenza infection and (2) a triggering context – emergence of a new sub-type/strain, and its co-circulation (competition?) with seasonal viruses immunologically related to ones that had circulated in the past and primed particular population birth-cohorts.

The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFNα/β production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFNα/β production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFNα/β production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFNα than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88-independent stimulus, consistent with CD200's known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells. In contrast, blocking CD200 with an anti-CD200 mAb resulted in reduced IFNα production by pDC-containing splenocytes in response to CpG and influenza virus (MyD88-dependent stimuli). This suggests there could be a differential effect of CD200 on MyD88 dependent and independent IFN induction pathways in pDC and macrophages. This study supports the hypothesis that a mannan-inhibitable lectin and CD200 are involved in virally induced type I IFN

It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase after serum starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells. Based on the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression, and are controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), a key molecule induced by prolonged starvation and involved in mitochondrial metabolism, we hypothesized that PGC-1α might be related with the cell cycle function of Bcl-2. Here, we showed that PGC-1α was upregulated upon Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following Bcl-2 knockdown during serum starvation. Knockdown of PGC-1α activated Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that after serum depletion, PGC-la might coordinate with Bcl-2 to reduce ROS, which in turn delay cell cycle progression.Summary statementPGC-1α coordinate with Bcl-2 delay cell cycle progression to reduce ROS after serum depletion in human glioma U251 cells.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a1ac4479bf067cc71d1d7cc1896e6ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a1b59f9f0b2717e07c64a8881c911b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0abf28817250521612d8250cadc95e34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11cd1199592f1f9b2e04adc5dd896b4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35b2d578cb30c8a9da8c23008d28da75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36d0a62cfb9a276a72e3229b8bec2a88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cbdc1f87fb9f409e2a9ef9db3a87cc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41a8f75313b7216bfa3fb78559bb5ab5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53a6ea90aebfdf7df86804621e6cbc45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/651648b177fe525e6b78246b2c065a54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/651a8f8abdc530b6a362526ff27d2ba8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b2698fed4bb2efae9b89b2122051c84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f1453482e05463b26bdbdb8f0627696, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/964f5618e2e257dc5c4ffd2033c64c5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d23e9f9b3f2b3f3c89c352611ffd513, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c774bc089b07b0ee722b9aa9e1f2843c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cae4806e06425e9cfc362e790f658062, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d238fdb32b7ddc1d296a2bf5a02718f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4c1b1c458e647abaa69416215806c8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbd7e4bfdd4f92e832b15e7c1f035030, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc0f8e637962070813be026a3f015dec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df48c04cd9260b49eec271b627f93047, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eedd655dbf0f0fe9d8707bad9e863b47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef89a1cc829c47b82960c112eaed9518"

These relationships are hypothesized to reflect the causal impact of seasonal environmental factors. However, recent work casts doubt on this interpretation by showing that mothers with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to give birth in months that are associated with poorer birth outcomes. Seasonality in the numbers of conceptions in different months can also induce a mechanical correlation between preterm birth and month of birth. This paper analyzes the seasonality of health at birth using a large sample of 647,050 groups of US siblings representing 1,435,213 children. By following the same mother over time, we eliminate differences in fixed maternal characteristics as an explanation for seasonal differences in health at birth. We find a sharp trough in gestation length among babies conceived in May, which corresponds to an increase in prematurity of more than 10%. Birth weight conditional on gestation length, however, is found to be strongly hump-shaped over the year, with 8–9 additional g for summer conceptions. We examine several potential mechanisms for explaining seasonality in birth outcomes that have generally been dismissed in the literature on seasonality in rich countries, notably disease prevalence and nutrition. The May trough in gestation length coincides with a higher influenza prevalence in January and February, when these babies are nearing full term, whereas the hump shape in birth weight is associated with a similar pattern in pregnancy weight gain.",""

MHV-A59 virions use as a receptor a 110- to 120-kDa glycoprotein (MHVR) in the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of glycoproteins (G. S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991; and R. K. Williams, G. S. Jiang, and K. V. Holmes, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:5533-5536, 1991). The role of virus-receptor interactions in determining the species specificity of MHV-A59 was examined by comparing the binding of virus and antireceptor antibodies to cell lines and intestinal brush border membranes (BBM) from many species. Polyclonal antireceptor antiserum (anti-MHVR) raised by immunization of SJL/J mice with BALB/c BBM recognized MHVR specifically in immunoblots of BALB/c BBM but not in BBM from adult SJL/J mice that are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, indicating a major difference in epitopes between MHVR and its SJL/J homolog which does not bind MHV (7). Anti-MHVR bound to plasma membranes of MHV-susceptible murine cell lines but not to membranes of human, cat, dog, monkey, or hamster cell lines. Cell lines from these species were resistant to MHV-A59 infection, and only the murine cell lines tested were susceptible. Pretreatment of murine fibroblasts with anti-MHVR prevented binding of radiolabeled virions to murine cells and prevented virus infection. Solid-phase virus-binding assays and virus overlay protein blot assays showed that MHV-A59 virions bound to MHVR on intestinal BBM from MHV-susceptible mouse strains but not to proteins on intestinal BBM from humans, cats, dogs, pigs, cows, rabbits, rats, cotton rats, or chickens. In immunoblots of BBM from these species, both polyclonal and monoclonal antireceptor antibodies that block MHV-A59 infection of murine cells recognized only the murine CEA-related glycoprotein and not homologous CEA-related glycoproteins of other species. These results suggest that MHV-A59 binds to a mouse-specific epitope of MHVR, and they support the hypothesis that the species specificity of MHV-A59 infection may be due to the specificity of the virus-receptor interaction.",""

A variety of lines of evidence suggest that this interaction induces exaggerated inflammatory, cytokine and tissue remodeling responses. We hypothesized that the 2′-5′OAS/RNase L system, an innate immune antiviral pathway, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these exaggerated responses. To test this hypothesis we characterize the activation of 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) in lungs from mice exposed to CS and viral PAMPs/live virus, alone and in combination. We also evaluated the inflammatory and remodeling responses induced by CS and virus/viral PAMPs in lungs from RNase L null and wild type mice. These studies demonstrate that CS and viral PAMPs/live virus interact in a synergistic manner to stimulate the production of select OAS moieties. They also demonstrate that RNase L plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of the exaggerated inflammatory, fibrotic, emphysematous, apoptotic, TGF-β1 and type I IFN responses induced by CS plus virus/viral PAMP in combination. These studies demonstrate that CS is an important regulator of antiviral innate immunity, highlight novel roles of RNase L in CS plus virus induced inflammation, tissue remodeling, apoptosis and cytokine elaboration and highlight pathways that may be operative in COPD and mechanistically-related disorders.",""

The expression of PTEN controlled by p53 regulates autoimmune arthritis through modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg. We hypothesized that PTEN regulated by p53 might reduce CIA severity and inflammatory response via inhibiting STAT3 activation. Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. We observed that PTEN expression downregulated by p53 deficiency induced the activation of STAT3. Loss of p53 exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and dysregulated the population of Th17 and Treg.

To mimic the possible field conditions, swine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV in vitro simultaneously or with one virus 18 h earlier than the other. The cell viability, cytopathic effects, antigen-containing rates, phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities, cytokine profiles (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-α) and FasL transcripts were determined, analyzed, and compared to prove the hypothesis. RESULTS: A marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-α expression level was revealed in AMs inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously and in AMs inoculated with PCV2 first then PRRSV 18 h later, but not in AMs inoculated with PRRSV first then PCV2 18 h later. Transient decrease in phagocytosis but constant reduction in microbicidal capability in AMs in the group inoculated with PCV2 alone and constant decrease in phagocytosis and microbicidal capability in AMs in all PRRSV-inoculated groups were noted. The levels of IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-α, and FasL transcripts in AMs in all groups with dual inoculation of PCV2 and PRRSV were significantly increased regardless of the infection orders as compared with infection by PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. CONCLUSIONS: Swine AMs infected with PCV2 first then PRRSV later or infected with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously displayed marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-α expression level. The different inoculation orders of PCV2 and PRRSV in AMs leading to different results in viral antigen positivity, cytopathology, and cytokine profile may explain, at least partially, the underlying mechanism of the enhanced pulmonary lesions in PRDC exerted by dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV and the variable clinical manifestations of PRDC-affected pigs in the field.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04e26297a8d7a2940472145425e19564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07750c7d1e38a9d5cba244388a693530, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e582bd9bc7d724607851a7d7c148f38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22ecf72c854fc9bec822110632b958d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32d522df976fd3c02f2e095a35394af5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/353f240ed4107efee31e913f847675bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39aea14832137f7fd311a71305b2ebe9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39bca1d35d90c95ece42455bb8eab271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a6aaff0ab3135ca9fb0cd389979bae8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4805a5443a39e63e4ffdaa156b2ac6e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a9b5639ced930d2a8fd74522cddf229, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5781fe77fb0a7efd341479cff3596aeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58ae4b3941e13b8a168d0cb68c55c036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5979defc9e086af604ad41c7f141702f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62291be47b53afb791658e9062d2db69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/639e78436fae4b302ad0f34bf2dbecdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68074bae4b346acf6d67607cefa7c5c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fc372db01d0c24c2fb1577fa73a5fdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8209ee2b8274ccfd49861bc2e1b611ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/849f1bbe6df57b14c6ab2c2adf654134, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88740e643acecd791ae00e98bd1f1b6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9105a0c6fc57db37af2088c651f8a6ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa098bba5c463c6128cbf225dc2e261a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbb04dac8e201205ff63d93e98408622, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c52d2b3d7cbf2661f7a35242b7b4522b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c65439e07127da6086d4be074327f902, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caf2c635e429690b7b954d38f4f1654e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daa89b2e3d160d1011b59ce1f0577f34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fafd8bbe73fb00b0925a61dba514873b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd64adb7984f44afdf530f37c6929c77"

The results showed the optimal timing for devising pertinent policies during the year. We found that the first step requires a safety information announcement, within one week, immediately after disaster site decontamination. The second step is the implementation of event information policy within 24th to 36th week after the disaster. The third step constitutes announcing visitor information within the 37th to 52nd week after the second step. The final step is the implementation of price discounting policy, until the 52nd week, immediately after the third step.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95411d346012e130e03a470939bc7eb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7a04d811cd5736d3a923c529cad9c47"

Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNK-phosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae induced the release of distinct CC and CXC, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines and growth factors by human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae time-dependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser(63/73)-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNFα. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 expression by human epithelial BEAS-2B cells depended on activation of JNK and recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun to the il8 promoter.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/001155ccc0fbd42bf0d44a579c098e9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/096d7b9fd5c6c9353b5e2a8edd55348a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1146d4f6e72757a42b653a0b119e8c77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bf86d693a51fdacd970b8fcd2a8c58a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24e26d5b48255143c4a0379dec772cd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2610cdec0cac1e50880fa10f68ef6843, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27210adbf6efab0c44fd2d54d603ab36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f7197c6612f39fd4d0c1224b203bcd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78dcfd1b861065043addf4a83d3dc797, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c41052b4ad02f6960b28227271be395, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d7104854e9c3cb8b7d41c7244b19765, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/874336b85e4ac81969d6a329465dbcec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/897567a76fc7410a4484606b8e04aafd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98fe85885533509b8b9fe526175f0c98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6a8af086ec51677bda2aa67c350638f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5b475b0551a01d115f758c23b88995e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c04fcf63f8362f460af4c980f85f54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baee0366ff53a0d2cd6c0c458984938b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf49438d1f50f9f5764b6b59c645a2bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c306018965a669f8c7c928a4ad3fb3c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d409df265e846fe3d37a8fbc44af961e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d69839644583e55c858cbf3209d75005, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d96cfa19b941a0ebf44e45343295e871, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfa841499f6775ccf0be191feaf25271, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eee48b94641c61522ea07595a6fc19ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efaceb51d9502f1d47341ec88f67b9d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9cf82a4384fb617bca41c3c92f6f2b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff75afafd5a8592af277427c4c768a51"

Because alpha herpesviruses spread along synaptic circuits, and infected neurons exhibit altered electrophysiology and increased spontaneous firing, we hypothesized that alpha herpesviruses use activity-dependent synaptic vesicle-like regulated secretory mechanisms for egress and spread from neurons. To address this hypothesis, we used a compartmentalized primary neuron culture system to measure egress and spread of pseudorabies virus (PRV), pharmacological and optogenetics approaches to modulate neuronal firing activity, and a live-cell fluorescence microscopy assay to directly visualize the exocytosis of individual virus particles from infected neurons. Using tetrodotoxin to silence neuronal activity, we observed no inhibition of virus spread, and using potassium chloride or optogenetics to elevate neuronal activity, we also show no increase in virus spread. Using a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to directly measure virus egress from infected neurons, we observed no association between virus particle exocytosis and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Finally, we observed virus particle exocytosis occurs in association with constitutive secretory Rab GTPases, Rab6a and Rab8a, not Rab proteins that are associated with the Ca2+-regulated secretory pathway in neurons, Rab3a and Rab11a. Therefore, we conclude that alpha herpesvirus egress and spread is independent of neuronal activity and Ca2+ signaling because virus particle exocytosis uses constitutive secretory mechanisms in neurons.Author SummaryAlpha herpesviruses, including important human pathogens Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2, and Varicella-Zoster Virus, are among the very few viruses that naturally infect the nervous system. These viruses cause recurrent herpetic and zosteriform lesions, peripheral neuropathies, and deadly or debilitating central nervous system diseases. Many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of viral egress and spread remain unknown, particularly in the context of specialized neuronal cell biology. Our results indicate that elevated firing activity of infected neurons is not functionally or mechanistically linked to virus egress and spread; therefore, therapies targeting peripheral neuropathic symptoms, elevated neuronal activity, and synaptic vesicle secretory mechanisms are unlikely to affect virus spread in the nervous system.",""

Recent studies have confirmed the impact of increased fidelity on RNA virus replication and pathogenesis; however, the impact of decreased fidelity is less defined.

Genetically stable exoribonuclease mutants will allow direct testing of viral mutational tolerance to RNA mutagens and other selective pressures.

The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTIs currently relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT). It is conceivable, however, that these diagnostic methods also yield positive results if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT. Positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. The existence of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has not been established. We hypothesized that asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated by current diagnostic methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted at the Erasmus MC–Sophia Children's Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Asymptomatic children (n = 405) and children with RTI symptoms (n = 321) aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from July 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011. Clinical data, pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens, and serum samples were collected. The primary objective was to differentiate between colonization and symptomatic infection with M. pneumoniae by current diagnostic methods, especially real-time PCR. M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 21.2% (95% CI 17.2%–25.2%) of the asymptomatic children and in 16.2% (95% CI 12.2%–20.2%) of the symptomatic children (p = 0.11). Neither serology nor quantitative PCR nor culture differentiated asymptomatic carriage from infection. A total of 202 children were tested for the presence of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. Finally, longitudinal sampling showed persistence of M. pneumoniae in the URT for up to 4 mo. Fifteen of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae and 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae in this longitudinal follow-up tested negative after 1 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study has limitations, such as a single study site and limited sample size, our data indicate that the presence of M. pneumoniae in the URT is common in asymptomatic children. The current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection.

Recently, influenza virus-like sequences were identified in bats; however, the viruses could not be cultured. This discovery aroused great interest in understanding the evolutionary history and pandemic potential of bat-influenza. Using synthetic genomics, we were unable to rescue the wild type bat virus, but could rescue a modified bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA coding regions replaced with those of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1). This modified bat-influenza virus replicated efficiently in vitro and in mice, resulting in severe disease. Additional studies using a bat-influenza virus that had the HA and NA of A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) showed that the PR8 HA and NA contributed to the pathogenicity in mice. Unlike other influenza viruses, engineering truncations hypothesized to reduce interferon antagonism into the NS1 protein didn't attenuate bat-influenza. In contrast, substitution of a putative virulence mutation from the bat-influenza PB2 significantly attenuated the virus in mice and introduction of a putative virulence mutation increased its pathogenicity. Mini-genome replication studies and virus reassortment experiments demonstrated that bat-influenza has very limited genetic and protein compatibility with Type A or Type B influenza viruses, yet it readily reassorts with another divergent bat-influenza virus, suggesting that the bat-influenza lineage may represent a new Genus/Species within the Orthomyxoviridae family. Collectively, our data indicate that the bat-influenza viruses recently identified are authentic viruses that pose little, if any, pandemic threat to humans; however, they provide new insights into the evolution and basic biology of influenza viruses.",""

After weaning, eight male offspring rats were randomly selected at each group and fed with diets correspondent to their parents’ for 70 days. The effects of exposure to TT51 on male reproductive system of offspring rats were assessed through sperm parameters, testicular function enzyme activities, serum hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone levels), testis histopathological examination, and the relative expression levels of selected genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary- testicular (HPT) axis. Results No significant differences were observed in body weight, food intake, organ/body weights, serum hormone, sperm parameters, testis function enzyme ACP, LDH, and SDH activities, testis histopathological changes, and relative mRNA expression levels of GnRH-R, FSH-R, LH-R, and AR along the HPT axis. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate that parental dietary exposure to TT51 reveals no significant differences on the reproductive system of male offspring rats compared with MingHui63 and control.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78f8b4ff966379c40cf9179b0d6229ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a4593375cb20db33695ed9af9b6b7aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8ea465586d11f6640bf8ae8c49adf8c"

A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient's weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted. Studies which, along these lines, show an environmental impact on genetic secretion in the phenotype are underlined. Also discussed in passing are several mechanisms which go towards explaining neutrophilic asthma – for many a contradiction, given eosinophilia's stranglehold on asthmatic inflammation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c3474edeff73a202b1a68f6f1d770b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/725c45b266a926afc26bb2d6286214a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6f0acd6e2c2f0e0277f3a5a2dcb18d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daeee91b2bb120e1c716fab2ff0afa82"

We aimed to assess the effect of azithromycin on the duration of respiratory episodes in young children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, hypothesising that it reduces the duration of the symptomatic period. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children aged 1–3 years, who were diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort; a birth cohort consisting of the general Danish population of Zealand, including Copenhagen. Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of ≥50 breaths per min; fever of ≥39°C; C-reactive protein concentration of ≥476·20 nmol/L [≥50 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verified by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297. Findings Between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 asthma-like episodes in 72 children (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo). The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3·4 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7·7 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a significant shortening of the episode of 63·3% (95% CI 56·0–69·3; p<0·0001). The effect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0·0001). We noted no differences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in final analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0·30), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment. Interpretation Azithromycin reduced the duration of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting that this drug could have a role in acute management of exacerbations. Further research is needed to disentangle the inflammatory versus antimicrobial aspects of this relation.

As the intracellular respiratory pathogen L. pneumophila or the extracellular uropathogen FimH(+) Escherichia coli entered macrophages by a cholesterol-sensitive mechanism, they immediatezly resided in vacuoles rich in glycosylphosphatidylinositol moieties and the autophagy enzyme Atg7. As expected for autophagosomes, the vacuoles sequentially acquired the endoplasmic reticulum protein BiP, the autophagy markers Atg8 and monodansyl-cadaverine, and the lysosomal protein LAMP-1. A robust macrophage response to the pathogens was cholesterol-dependent, since fewer Atg7-rich vacuoles were observed when macrophages were pretreated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or filipin.

Recent studies suggest that toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and that the reason for corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory diseases is related to the anti-inflammatory activities of corticosteroids through the reduction of NF-κB. We hypothesized that the administration of TLR ligands in combination with corticosteroid causes ONFH and that transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH. The aim of the study was to evaluate (1) the incidence of ONFH in rats after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands together with methylprednisolone (MPSL) and (2) whether transcription factors contribute to the development of ONFH. Male Wistar rats (n=148) were divided into five groups as follows: Group 1: Saline+MPSL, Group 2: Imiquimod+Saline, Group 3: Imiquimod+MPSL, Group 4: CpG-C+MPSL, Group 5: Imiquimod+BAY11-7082+MPSL. As a result, ONFH was observed in 0 of 12 rats in Group 1, in 1 of 10 in Group 2, in 6 of 12 in Group 3, in 4 of 12 in Group 4, in 0 of 9 in Group 5. MPSL treatment did not significantly affect IRF7 activity, whereas NF-κB activity was significantly repressed in Group 2 and Group 3. Furthermore, the repression in interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activity by BAY11-7082 interfered with the development of ONFH simultaneously with the MPSL treatment-induced repression in NF-κB activity. In conclusion, in the present study, corticosteroid treatment after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands caused ONFH. Repression in NF-κB activity by corticosteroid treatment boosted the development of ONFH.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04fc2318d4cf60899a31e29eee1348b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc08008dde4e777e3791800d2810b99e"

This helps to facilitate the enhancement of DNA vaccine potency via strategies that modify the properties of APCs. We have previously demonstrated that DNA vaccines encoding human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen linked to calreticulin (CRT) are capable of enhancing the E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses and antitumor effects against E7-expressing tumors. It has also been shown that cluster (short-interval) DNA vaccination regimen generates potent immune responses in a minimal timeframe. Thus, in the current study we hypothesize that the cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination will generate significant antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell infiltrates in E7-expressing tumors in tumor-bearing mice, leading to an increase in apoptotic tumor cell death. We found that cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination is capable of rapidly generating a significant number of E7-specific CD8(+) T cells, resulting in significant therapeutic antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. We also observed that cluster intradermal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination in the presence of tumor generates significantly higher E7-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses in the systemic circulation as well as in the tumors. In addition, this vaccination regimen also led to significantly lower levels of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells and myeloid suppressor cells compared to vaccination with CRT DNA in peripheral blood and in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in an increase in apoptotic tumor cell death. Thus, our study has significant potential for future clinical translation.",""

Pregnant multiparous sows and their litters were allocated to one of 3 treatment groups: Group 1–6 serum antibody-negative sows and a subset (n=11) of their piglets. Group 2–8 serum antibody-positive sows and their 91 piglets. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV at 4 (Group 1) or 2 (Group 2) days of age. Group 3–2 PEDV serum antibody-negative sows and 22 piglets, provided a baseline for piglet survivability and growth rate. Piglets were monitored daily for clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature through day post-inoculation (DPI) 12 (Groups 2 and 3) or 14 (Group 1). Serum and mammary secretions were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. Feces were tested by PEDV real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Piglets on sows without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) anti-PEDV antibody showed significantly different responses to PEDV infection in virus shedding (p < 0.05), thermoregulation (p < 0.05), growth rate (p < 0.05), and survivability (p <0.0001). Specifically, Group 1 piglets shed more virus on DPIs 1 to 5, were hypothermic at all sampling points except DPIs 9, 11, and 12, gained weight more slowly, and exhibited lower survivability than Group 2 piglets. Within Group 2 litters, significant differences were found in virus shedding (p < 0.05), and body temperature (p < 0.05), but not in piglet survival rate. The number of sows and litters in Group 2 was insufficient to derive the relationship between specific levels of lactogenic antibody (FFN, IgA, and IgG) and the amelioration of clinical effects. However, when combined with previous PEDV literature, it can be concluded that the optimal protection to piglets will be provided by dams able to deliver sufficient lactogenic immunity, both humoral and cellular, to their offspring.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d7775f3e41b349a2341495e286ec431, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10a3e794b4ac66b2e5fa8cecbdfc1c4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b67320f583d85d3159e3aeb0634a8e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20a5568d1ffe4fc412ae2a973a1dd266, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/293fb634c8810924712fc7660ee1127f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37018b16cb3106e06a064336a84123df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37edfba24ad9a12dccf718e29e7ea04f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ba208b0e97d96da711cee5f73b58086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cddf07ebe1cb470bbd11952f9368ca7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dc62af83929d52d5633f5ad3240f16a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50f8110e53dd15b20f4c045bc86e796c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51f18ff4e65a8231d0c9f0c15ea99d6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d04d96b20cfce3f26b5c649389f5f85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dd54a7f085e54afc5fdc6bd262662ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/617d22875d15790d08e5e3850309fdc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67ca5ccf314baa7bb3cb3a860ccce517, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c9073fd232421648e23684bb4c70135, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6daeae17afde5f0acc11a4daf67940f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70fb18fbcd5fe193895a044c1964430b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73f1375ef3ff5b33cbb67aa95390b047, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74b5e37ac4ab28901c2c51cbb5d7a255, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/781f668410a6034f42c4f17500d8bcaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88b0153153db3de20e0bd75e6dbb48bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c87d2e6337c0926198704df8a0579d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9390c68752783afca342cbf97d528e93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a8e8c1f2d6b7f173e2bed108c80ce05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c6ad1f483568eda52527cca43e158ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d2d03687ebddaf54580a06242a6a35c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f38fba2dc9afcea9491f3541523032f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a78620196334b29b42dda12aa7f4db9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a791b18b5dcbff4dbc2236bf46ea4267, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4acb9a423c6b24a005dca54f0715b7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b56c00df20377c58dd77a22386dac772, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf0d29984f74241b4a205e1e4810ce9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c17ce002c8d57fce2ec62ca5006c572e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce793ceb97ee0c6ebc02a50215a207f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf774e4ada62d8f32e7303147d24989e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da61a6af7055db3aa694f1a9831291dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddcf64d4c6b4f4695ee1cc9d72f9f348, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3de66c17013cfae0ea6285e9ef9746f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e783a8d19882014f12815db2397018b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eab5840b8d4d13387141d42ba9bdd97e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f41967129432fac65d4a1cc33d77946a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f70521fe55917e5934b7f89224537600, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf5e4a5386e1c619befe850d0e284fa"

Because ketoprofen is a nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that can damage the gastrointestinal tract, the putative diagnosis for these morbidities and mortalities was gastrointestinal toxicity caused by ketoprofen (5 mg/kg). We conducted a prospective study evaluating the effect of this therapeutic dose of ketoprofen on the rat gastrointestinal tract within 24 h. Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg SC) was administered to one group of rats that then received gas anesthesia for 30 min and to another group without subsequent anesthesia. A third group was injected with saline followed by 30 min of gas anesthesia. Our primary hypothesis was that noteworthy gastrointestinal bleeding and lesions would occur in both groups treated with ketoprofen but not in rats that received saline and anesthesia. Our results showed marked gastrointestinal bleeding, erosions, and small intestinal ulcers in the ketoprofen-treated rats and minimal damages in the saline-treated group. The combination of ketoprofen and anesthesia resulted in worse clinical signs than did ketoprofen alone. We conclude that a single 5-mg/kg dose of ketoprofen causes acute mucosal damage to the rat small intestine.",""

This study tested the hypothesis that the infection causes negligible impact on pigs’ growth performance in terms of feed conversion efficiency, daily feed intake, daily growth, age on reaching 100 kg bodyweight and overall feed intake. A sample of 1955 pigs originating from 43 breeding herds was classified into five infection status groups; seronegative pigs (n = 887); seropositive pigs (n = 874); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 33 kg and 60 kg (n = 123); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 61 kg and 80 kg (n = 34) and pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 81 kg and 100 kg (n = 37). Each pig had daily recordings of feed intake and bodyweight from 33 kg to 100 kg. Marginal effects of the virus infection on the outcomes were estimated by multi-level linear regression, which accounted for known fixed effects (breed, birthdate, average daily feed intake and growth phase) and random effects (cluster effects of pig and herd). RESULTS: The seropositive and virus positive pigs had decreased (P value<0.05) growth performance compared to seronegative pigs even though feed intake was not decreased. Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirement and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg bodyweight. The effects were more marked (P value<0.03) in pigs infected at a younger age and lasted a longer period. Despite increased feed intake observed, their growth rates were lower and they took more time to reach 100 kg bodyweight compared to the seronegative pigs. CONCLUSION: Our study rejected the null hypothesis that the virus infection had negligible adverse effects on growth performance of Norwegian pigs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0711d24a81b7107bcb351252c110d88d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07302d4c9da25d05b4b9c143ebfcb45c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11f0f9e55ca86589a724c2d3f97f8c1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15f072dc4d1591dad7534b00a756ddd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16f2adfd2c1a0156079a5a44c64a7acd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d64c465fe554d7a894b4709f3b999c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51764e24fe7478b65eca0502a9f23af6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54a64f627e252e2a6250f3bf2c684d96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6079760ac47a3a02d0e75490dedde695, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c55524f03c4e3561285c816dc75ffee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f42b52719d85f496a0c239b1cbb9b3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a302b51e8636de948991e15b0642cda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b57031b21caa8aba1f87c455c179b5d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b66552fd015957f24ab6773ac542c71f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b97e0a366c9e363c738016fea1909d2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd9807b185f469843087c776ac7c198c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdf20034ecf749fc7fa60c0c121d7a77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7d5987266cec01e246580dff0b8214a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2b4ce7a5ffa72df6ce2d314991efc25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9da3ad96e830d44a27b1fa511bb6c9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f687c6a3371236bb696f6f5435ef309a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f885693378c830da0558cfc3c7d5197a"

While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs. TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling. These results demonstrate that several viral RNA-binding proteins can enhance the dsRNA-dependent innate immune response initiated by TLR3.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/026925c713545f5b5bfb40a873d54614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/041ad9f8ce73a2874ae80b674bca2477, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06466a2deb673605fa4a8756f1e897c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06ff756e021f7f032a37094b4a2c36ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/092ce59a3107d4b6f61c74f2b0df9927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17c9b5c224e76689e742e3c4c178ca62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ac611ba3614a8de4862e467f9b02176, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2298444cf740f65ce8bf67c4d418be4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24a7825fec1176381470c48e7d45ab42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b2b7f24a60b14f8dd070a3f6521971c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ed542f6f397834f349aa5671b79e4df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34cbeeb9f7541856028e81aad5cd7200, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f0f0f9eb7c77fc4ccf83e5b910f553c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3faeaf454b96d598523c3664401a4773, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4dedf23f1520fbf23197f5d2ef306d51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ccc48e78b295c5abdaa896c12005146, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ed58bc01e050ca2abed81ec61941d65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6639ad62056ba6d9d4e5a7efabf0a0a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/666603f83d71181ac471ffc95e815a1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cb6966c63aad644c27d9fda29d48d3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6fad1b642a31c28bc17608093aafb8d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77a35382d4c6b0ec1522f88e11cad856, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ab83932af8b2d63bdfe4399f5c9bc27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80abc0974ecb160c69c2bb64a961de4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89345638f29d5e7c7d7fe545e54ea233, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ca283a5c3c58ab00d065fff9fb847c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cf71b4afab2a9f53f8423c5a4792358, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9257f0f88d960dd200fb2dfb0e9591f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94b89f58e730f75939d42ad9609e17d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95815262442d57a54d9ad30e4bd0f491, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1465bcba828f6f8f57d4982ae70c38d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab9909bb3a724666717686c2a0553e42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af6202881c3e749e506934b5eb23d05a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3ed0cc8390ec371b580c50a7af8a145, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cab372d2e2c3ac8d12d3518054e9e77f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cba9c3e2714bfda5f8b9d7b8c607afb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdae68c8f25df7f7e6696926f4d51de1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6e2d66fc7d2c7c0bace6248ad0b5f73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8b7a29b0571ee0415e211045049a198, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5be573237b669b8fe75e485ef31c996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f984dd36a8de31c7de3aca2a4122dbd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb39525e747b17ab5d4b75c8fbaaf7e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc6bdee3fc2f5d3e58457a79316657ee"

Human papillomavirus has been established as the causative agent for cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer. However, the tumor biology involved in the prognoses of different cell types in early cancers and tumor responses to radiation in advanced cancers remain largely unknown. The introduction of microarray technologies in the 1990s has provided genome-wide strategies for searching tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. In this review, we first summarize the two types of microarrays: oligonucleotides microarray and cDNA microarray. Then, we review the studies of functional genomics in cervical cancer. Gene expression studies that involved cervical cancer cell lines, cervical cells of cancer versus normal ectocervix, cancer tissues of different histology, radioresistant versus radiosensitive patients, and the combinatorial gene expression associated with chromosomal amplifications are discussed. In particular, CEACAM5, TACSTD1, S100P, and MSLN have shown to be upregulated in adenocarcinoma, and increased expression levels of CEACAM5 and TACSTD1 were significantly correlated with poorer patient outcomes. On the other hand, 35 genes, including apoptotic genes (e.g. BIK, TEGT, SSI-3), hypoxia-inducible genes (e.g. HIF1A, CA12), and tumor cell invasion and metastasis genes (e.g. CTSL, CTSB, PLAU, CD44), have been noted to echo the hypothesis that increased tumor hypoxia leads to radiation resistance in cervical cancer during radiation.",""

These viral species all can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), but share no gene similarity. The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood‐sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. We present evidence that these observations are only partly explained by differences in nucleotide composition of the complete viral codon regions.

By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection.

Following subtraction hybridization, a cDNA library was constructed and displayed by differential reverse dot blot hybridization. This new genomic subtraction hybridization method will be ideally suited to identify rapidly any previously unrecognized viral agent.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0de3409d5ac5f6f039b46a1d3955e63a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bef1d35f59f6b977ba0521b39ea3869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36a3b6271e99794d8975c79ed25d56fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d27450f252775ca89ab53c724024638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4233cf002a50138c3c0c2f104bb0213c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fae2e2dbdfaeaacdbdbbf702d0ecbc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d371122bb70e7ef7f29bc45540d924f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72030489948de37bc714ce1258be92e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/760b346b8e7ac523bd6d0eb59da80248, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79345093788b42aa5c962581c336df69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/797c988b20244e3e1a001a5d68d09bf0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/806c58fa82a4dce47ccf6336090daf9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8552f35a26af584cb227485254ca0f5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f6a7da080a47f8a89110c31cfec41ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8f60ca8228c12eeb2b5c576cfd7ef1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa2105d6e0de21e3e885c9133dfb9cd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f55a34c6817225fe0db8d6021649271c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f61c45b206d482b619f1ef9f30b8b3f3"

Patients et méthodes Les 90 patients hospitalisés du 16 mars au 30 avril 2003 furent inclus dans cette étude prospective. Les données échangées avec les institutions sanitaires locales permirent à la fois une classification de cas officielle («possibles», «probables», «exclus») et une classification locale basée sur une adaptation de celle-ci, incluant une catégorie supplémentaire dans la graduation du risque, intermédiaire entre «possible» et «exclu» («douteux»). Résultats L'évaluation initiale différait dans 39% des cas (n =35), sur des arguments épidémiologiques (n =24) ou clinicobiologiques (n =11). L'évaluation finale divergeait dans 54% des cas (n =47). Tous les patients furent officiellement considérés comme des cas «exclus» de SRAS, alors que 47 demeuraient des cas «possibles» ou «douteux» selon les cliniciens. Conclusion Une différence de perception existait dans environ 40% des cas, sans impact en termes de diffusion épidémique ou d'exposition nosocomiale, puisqu'aucun cas probable de SRAS n'a été retenu parmi ces patients ou leur entourage.

Abstract Objective The characteristics of patients with a suspected SARS hospitalized in a Paris hospital were studied to analyze the hypothetic differences between epidemiologic and clinical teams in the management of an epidemic emerging disease, and to gather experience for the management of the next outbreak. Study design All 90 patients hospitalized between March 16 and April 30, 2003, were included. Epidemiological and clinical data were shared with the French National Institute for Health. Cases were classified according to both the official definition (“possible”, “probable”, “excluded”) and a local one, adapted from the official definition but including an additional level of suspicion (“equivocal”), intermediate between “possible” and “excluded”. Results The initial assessment was different in 39% of the cases (n=35), according to epidemiological (n=24) or clinical (n=11) elements. The final assessment diverged in 54% of the cases (n=47). All patients were officially considered as %22excluded%22 for epidemiologists, while 47 remained as %22possible%22 or %22equivocal%22 cases of SARS according to the clinicians. Conclusion The risk assessment was different in almost 40% of the cases, with no impact on epidemic diffusion or hospital-borne exposure as no probable case of SARS was diagnosed among these patients or their households. The confrontation of these different but complementary points of view will thus enrich the interdisciplinary management of eventual future outbreaks.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13fed6dfa218bb000ef8abde633bb776, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ca46cd0c498810f2eef267f4f4a01f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52dc5d30f88878107d1d2a32c0364801, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/688995dfb44087e1f7a916f73dd85df3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb1818dc70398cc0f88a0b4e43245c41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d69098ca5783579f8dca2aab0b9eb7b1"

We hypothesised that HRVC would be present in children with acute asthma and cause more severe attacks than other viruses or HRV groups. METHODS: Children with acute asthma (n=128, 2–16 years) were recruited on presentation to an emergency department. Asthma exacerbation severity was assessed and respiratory viruses and HRV strains were identified in a nasal aspirate. RESULTS: The majority of the children studied had moderate to severe asthma (85.2%) and 98.9% were admitted to hospital. HRV was detected in 87.5% and other respiratory viruses in 14.8% of children, most of whom also had HRV. HRVC were present in the majority of children with acute asthma (59.4%) and associated with more severe asthma. Children with HRVC (n=76) had higher asthma severity scores than children whose HRV infection was HRVA or HRVB only (n=34, p=0.018), and all other children (n=50, p=0.016). Of 19 children with a non-HRV virus, 13 had HRV co-infections, seven of these being HRVC.

Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes’ true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/029ad55aca7296fec82db9aad194a707, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a147085b7f7ed9b568b7a7a0f11f8cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28cdfa2134381ca7cadd00ecbb5984a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/407d665bc1d37849ac19a14c715516cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/455a7fff5cd547b840a31c236cb8dd35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ba2fc765e8e86cd7df62acd147a676a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f4ad976c75fd4fad93da64f890eee5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54c00b0aabb41e13e607c5309b9d1db9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b14ea189f06b062c98e04f98fcdca26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dcc06a52ec1f57d1b2f1e95322f35c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70d479c11dfda8265e25bb66480a463d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fbd01fce8e4ebff3fcc18bc8df0a59f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80217c0d81a1114eb908e2cb2fd454e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b619707cfeb6c72309b698e8679917f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ad23504eb422fdd1b2e7711afbe1582, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1599d31800fa8002ec25715b36437d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4ea12a413cb3fd81ae25807e068b612, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6367e089784af36a5ed5cdb1c97e6b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bba69d514a067e3a702f939734c8cfaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bea02b25f1c318857748cda23517ea11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf670afc8421c13b50ae4441a431f4a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c70ab5140717ec9d1f18606e82e8c79b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d233325d2038d2a877965b9562bd3b56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5f13b71d22f5fbf9e73336fa62efd51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7eb35cad9144758ace1c393711bd87c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfa82aa27ae1c742bb71855a93ea6e98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3331252ac78fb1ad26075a43c86fac1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4e6e21eb1e8b2c94713a56fd69eccf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed9a7fedf73e392a905b6d50637cfaa7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc5ab11bc064c40cca990f01563daca7"

In the present study, we identified transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), whose expression does correlate with SARS-CoV infection in the upper lobe of the lung. In Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2, large syncytia were induced by SARS-CoV infection. Further, the lysosome-tropic reagents failed to inhibit, whereas the heptad repeat peptide efficiently inhibited viral entry into cells, suggesting that TMPRSS2 affects the S protein at the cell surface and induces virus-plasma membrane fusion. On the other hand, production of virus in TMPRSS2-expressing cells did not result in S-protein cleavage or increased infectivity of the resulting virus. Thus, TMPRSS2 affects the entry of virus but not other phases of virus replication. We hypothesized that the spatial orientation of TMPRSS2 vis-a-vis S protein is a key mechanism underling this phenomenon. To test this, the TMPRSS2 and S proteins were expressed in cells labeled with fluorescent probes of different colors, and the cell-cell fusion between these cells was tested. Results indicate that TMPRSS2 needs to be expressed in the opposing (target) cell membrane to activate S protein rather than in the producer cell, as found for influenza A virus and metapneumoviruses. This is the first report of TMPRSS2 being required in the target cell for activation of a viral fusion protein but not for the S protein synthesized in and transported to the surface of cells. Our findings suggest that the TMPRSS2 expressed in lung tissues may be a determinant of viral tropism and pathogenicity at the initial site of SARS-CoV infection.",""

When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the %22conservative transitions%22 hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1358bb18aac10db69f3112cbde17bf82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2937633286510251ecdb28f0e5c50419, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36d7840649e37d4d491c3360fb6578a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38ce178de828edeea654bddbbf368572, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5614a5be9b006af499d6c9f4183f4eed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cd20c15052d61d390706d865bd1440e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8579e54bd5a13972446a156e252b5c27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/946df4cf79eb02f039fca011e335ecd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c6942e960b28e693a3d675a6a38dac6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3d1e0fd36e5fd6d0af65a56d41cd022, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a753635dbf7a856b102c699e6f033f6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa93f62eddfc8154fe413e440db177b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3a60171fdcc38aff4f1caf4e04e1c50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2921863363cd784d534da33559521e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8434635d3917a33551996e7a422cd7e"

We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino- 1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms. Further, ceramide accumulation reveals this cycle by upsetting the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic and/ or disrupting retention by altering bilayer dynamics.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04077d9a7ce3a8119bf2d6ab54ebf805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fb5d414aed0ac8145a4db3a0e34a12d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/115d3c6f840b0d76d9ca7f11fd33c413, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20f248e5e1c762b37f7d9a0a9c713a31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dfe45aef579dd6c24691d525a9404b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b84de817cfddb3ea2e3b8c726a7e856, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cf23a65cf079c52cc9314620ec3a01a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f5610e8373362c6b9d08ce11001c2c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69b73a33320ffd4810aac07f65524e25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72b922aa7a843acc14335ed3092c249e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/838544bf44890990891ff3ee7d1688d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/878f775dd7cb1db32e9662ab12b16dc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97b907332b3c21a6700c12c94400cd52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98889f0b1b3b911316bb8702931547a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aab70225f7aedf9d55fa5509ffa6c35d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2ba01f341abe266a97ddba11a2132b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7ad4d7e290acd1ec95aa0337f155799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f36bc02ed844845921cbbfc2074e731a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7227aa3b52e60d8efc760e179a14b42"

Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood, and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use. OBJECTIVES: To determine if the use of a rapid viral detection test for children with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Emergency Departments (EDs) changes patient management and resource use in the ED, compared to not using a rapid viral detection test. We hypothesized that rapid viral testing reduces antibiotic use in the ED as well as reduces the rate of ancillary testing and length of ED visits. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 1, 2014), MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (15 July 2014), EMBASE.com (1988 to July 2014), HealthStar (1966 to 2009), BIOSIS Previews (1969 to July 2014), CAB Abstracts (1973 to July 2014), CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007) and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality, and extract data. We obtained missing data from trial authors. We expressed differences in rate of investigations and antibiotic use as risk ratios (RRs), and expressed difference in ED length of visits as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: No new trials were identified in this 2014 update. We included four trials (three RCTs and one quazi‐RCT), with 759 children in the rapid viral testing group and 829 in the control group. Three out of the four studies were comparable in terms of young age of participants, with one study increasing the age of inclusion up to five years of age. All studies included either fever or respiratory symptoms as inclusion criteria (two required both, one required fever or respiratory symptoms, and one required only fever). All studies were comparable in terms of exclusion criteria, intervention, and outcome data. In terms of risk of bias, one study failed to utilize a random sequence generator, one study did not comment on completeness of outcome data, and only one of four studies included allocation concealment as part of the study design. None of the studies definitively blinded participants. Rapid viral testing resulted in a trend toward decreased antibiotic use in the ED, but this was not statistically significant. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group, but no effect on length of ED visits, or blood or urine testing in the ED. No study made mention of any adverse effects related to viral testing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support routine rapid viral testing to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Rapid viral testing may or may not reduce rates of antibiotic use, and other investigations (urine and blood testing); these studies do not provide enough power to resolve this question. However, rapid viral testing does reduce the rate of chest X‐rays in the ED. An adequately powered trial with antibiotic use as an outcome is needed.",""

Natural selection has favored these viruses to be retained in the phloem to facilitate acquisition and transmission by aphids. We show that treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate with sodium sulfite reduces transmission of the purified virus by aphids. Transmission electron microscopy data indicated no gross change in virion morphology due to treatments. However, treated virions were not acquired by aphids through the hindgut epithelial cells and were not transmitted when injected directly into the hemocoel. Analysis of virus preparations using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed a number of host plant proteins co-purifying with viruses, some of which were lost following sodium sulfite treatment. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we show data suggesting that several of the virus-associated host plant proteins accumulated to higher levels in aphids that were fed on CYDV-infected plants compared to healthy plants. We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a) that sodium sulfite treatment disrupts critical virion-host protein interactions required for aphid transmission, or (b) that host infection with CYDV modulates phloem protein expression in a way that is favorable for virus uptake by aphids. Importantly, the genes coding for the plant proteins associated with virus may be examined as targets in breeding cereal crops for new modes of virus resistance that disrupt phloem-virus or aphid-virus interactions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/048f574673530956e113ef2ece062be6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04e0ee1abe41676dc5950ab9ac75c02b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07e37ddc5b73d201552dbf98465e4892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f822dbba168a1cbc842682738f49e2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12e0c23a21b9f1891185a3556e72902c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1525015e931aa59e8f59106ef91477c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18125956bae89b96443d9a6ccd502363, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/185ecbb6b847d1711c08b96985f85bc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f0232e0edb0c2cd59ef37d4e4f8a60e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2725cef4f196695181e60fae87f5b320, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a7dbaf3ff55ecea8e0251a703809c65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ee4695e9da2785dd19f60c1f269cbe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3374339fc272174dce56516e4793df8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3808f06c0991d4f44dcfde7c08665178, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42207c0957346339b4e358f20f920f92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ea974936bc038aee8ba036d4a6ff0a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54c4c4b9660534b048910481157568a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56814d2acc642607d3cc1e4199ca9d8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c713dc528fda2dab3119648b0c50cfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60ee6c5013f61de2480b6eeddb86c181, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6117f6cca90f4ce242cf8b7f9795ecce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/631027f21931b2bf172ef1dcc02c1bd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64a2e2fdf415720ff2adae76b440cd5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6748b2270d8fc6c30539a4f327a3070f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e5f06c4ba8079cb0c79209665c75bc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f17b1fa8c0b41191e3e1404496ed9d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7067d9dd25a5edd08d54622cedfeb0e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a01f7e234de2491a278845f62bd4b2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ef82bce7d0d6ffbb671197f32232148, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87f509a3f6d30aa47a2ce866ef6b879b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cb2dcfd7b0f889224dc1a03d994869d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93e09fb682668a29908b28c9d94672b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/971a75bc3f06c02ed044a1d5606e4249, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b89417b2fd56fe8091ca72d13cd07fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a241ae3010f5d68bcb9b2b7d1ebab2f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a28459f0a1a34484bde685068c431653, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeeae47d03791ab8705785537dbdc0c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b30aaf01269fbe67ecc1b1578bb9f6d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb5a2632eac77a0be725536f7de97ec9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdd2aba4d0bf47251ecc8704656e8021, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce34b68e1179a44b74eaeb645223aac8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7279751b0a8d1b27b3a49826eb701ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e907b517f08aa7400c2b5cc02e04ac4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecdf398bcbeb96836aeb757fd308277b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef0c8e06d8f715a8f9aa94d08b2e841b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f06e32e318cfe8d915d30ba7443faed0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1d1ff293ae8e22e6d03d6aa831a7574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d6c366367c54d992cd1ab2fb86eddc"

Early in outbreaks, evidence is scarce, but it accumulates rapidly. We are continuously facing new disease outbreaks, including the new coronavirus (SARS-nCoV-2) in December 2019.The objective of this study was to describe the accumulation of evidence during the 2013-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Pacific and the Americas related to aetiological causal questions about congenital abnormalities and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Methods: We hypothesised that the temporal sequence would follow a pre-specified order, according to study design. We assessed 1) how long it takes before findings from a specific study design appear, 2) how publication of preprints could reduce the time to publication and 3) how time to publication evolves over time. Results: We included 346 publications published between March 6, 2014 and January 1, 2019. In the 2013-2016 ZIKV outbreak, case reports, case series and basic research studies were published first. Case-control and cohort studies appeared between 400-700 days after ZIKV was first detected in the region of the study origin. Delay due to the publication process were lowest at the beginning of the outbreak. Only 4.6% of the publications was available as preprints. Discussion: The accumulation of evidence over time in new causal problems generally followed a hierarchy. Preprints reduced the delay to initial publication. Our methods can be applied to new emerging infectious diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15ab4a00275d297d2783f98a4ad286de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e29eb2337a2deeceafb351dd436c664, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f7b838232bc97dde0a04ac15e13c2e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/320ca05f810d2d3d734b5d5093746487, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b0ec64f5a689fa1fd2d8bf3d7afdfe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54307ac3df9ec684541b710b95fbc17a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/623d81a5b89cbcb54d92bf756e8d5dba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/640bb5253c2e9fe1f26c2ad0b045ec83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8049ed2518b5c7c5d5b6e46279e8032f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0ef8f0629b93485a7964c511439242e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8c8333927e444887732256a2f9fa143, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed2f808be863673eaaeeaabc07094861"

However, subjective sensation of nasal patency may be more associated with activation of cold receptors by inspired air than with respiratory effort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether subjective nasal patency correlates with nasal mucosal temperature in healthy subjects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two healthy adults were recruited for this study. Subjects first completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and a unilateral visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify subjective nasal patency. A miniaturized thermocouple sensor was then used to record nasal mucosal temperature bilaterally in two locations along the nasal septum: at the vestibule and across from the inferior turbinate head. RESULTS: The range of temperature oscillations during the breathing cycle, defined as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory temperatures, was greater during deep breaths (ΔT(exp-insp) = 6.2 ± 2.6°C) than during resting breathing (ΔT(exp-insp) = 4.2 ± 2.3°C) in both locations (p < 10(−13)). Mucosal temperature measured at the right vestibule had a statistically significant correlation with both right-side VAS score (Pearson r = −0.55, p=0.0076) and NOSE score (Pearson r = −0.47, p=0.028). No other statistically significant correlations were found between mucosal temperature and subjective nasal patency scores. Nasal mucosal temperature was lower in the first cavity to be measured, which was the right cavity in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation. A possible correlation was found between subjective nasal patency scores and nasal mucosal temperature, but our results were inconsistent. The higher temperature in the left cavity suggests that the sensor irritated the nasal mucosa, affecting the correlation between patency scores and mucosal temperature. Future studies should consider non-contact temperature sensors to prevent mucosa irritation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8212ea5bbee45fe95ad3110bf0aae471, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d221bfde66c6697facd470cdca61ee0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af363ed2d0af72f5a1804c8bdd6f8a0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d071ce3064c90c937c9783868920eb45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eabcd5a9c9ae57480646a0c3a943b342"

A total of 723 spots representing 574 protein entries were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, including the majority of known key virulence factors. 64 hypothetical proteins and six misannotated proteins were also experimentally identified. A comparison between the four proteome maps showed that most of the virulence-related proteins were up-regulated at 37 °C, and the differences were more notable in stationary phase cells, suggesting that the expressions of these virulence factors were not only controlled by temperature but also controlled by the nutrients available in the environment. The expression patterns of some virulence-related genes under the four different conditions suggested that they might also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. A further significant finding was that the expression of the protein ArgT was dramatically up-regulated at 30 °C. The results of semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that expression of argT was not regulated at the transcriptional level. Therefore, we carried out a series of experiments to uncover the mechanism regulating ArgT levels and found that the differential expression of ArgT was due to its degradation by a periplasmic protease, HtrA, whose activity, but not its synthesis, was affected by temperature. The cleavage site in ArgT was between position 160 (Val) and position 161 (Ala). These results may provide useful insights for understanding the physiology and pathogenesis of S. flexneri.",""

However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI− viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI− mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI−, but not with WT rSV5. Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system. We present a model for the effect of P/V gene substitutions on SV5 growth and immune responses in vivo.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01c7e74237d4ee7f15b40925d7c1eef6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07333d30d9315e5faee4f9cb219609a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12f66450a9722bef3613120d49eaa53e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1aa64c7698c8cd4663760cc05bed369a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dd97c14bd673c056b4bce721f9713e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2412075975e5b015b59e7b1883af8872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24e09c633a93a5f4feb567acf797b32e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a2b9ee77fbcdb895d1073311fc4565a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bb2489ca02899b6ab51c7ebf2ef4c7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e65c9a86256b0dfd4a1522bcd955053, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43ed78412790b707b6fc8a66d7afd056, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46baa4ba4f056e3f23cd94ba95ca58a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bbb76e362b794fa7d3eeac45274eaa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/511ffd90a9d54988d0b486c21e011ae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52c59322dfe853222ac67672cda5fb63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56072095f0f95fe060ae04aa23025c4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/564ab7299d32f11a558329103e150f3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59bc464cc44710b84b414ae765959563, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bbc0f8d3ca1a86d7319cc02de44b303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/642e8296d46831e19a1d44f7a34482d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6474c73a38f90677ffd48fca056db923, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6749f25c7984845e8d63afec44869f6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a7417aaac2b64accfd87be3cd538b85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c76917e8ddc43d2aa8b761c61de6936, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f22e52bc1ba05538ec70c54ab93d7d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8781e5ec3eb6c8f853b740bdc9bf7338, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88b4923e44bbfd4eec274e7d33aa3fe8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f04e7cbe5ce6cf7a2504ffc77361266, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95c1ff86d9e35658a4180fbde6adc928, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f6fb5f11d60ab9ba475fa00d9a89f5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a14360ec2f913baea01194011ae602de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b56c675833a2fe651ad3fdb2a008260e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ef4b458f80d01083f4f13077277508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdef02a4a21cf5e40dd001ceacf6d0f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be9ac2705e7a75f75a2eace9c150795f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf8a55fb9778b39d57d6948530039213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3700e582484150aa143cda912a30691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c582001e06169e2ffec85d6e6e6d3d7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce1443b0d282a938d33ad1bd20c3f889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf33bb6fc4995e15ea8ec6ce7a4fcc0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d236a114267e27fe4e298ce9af75a549, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9607f42c6d6f5c04b24bdb7d9f065e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd03a75e403ce94616b1cd24808bd1d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e384db6e76336d2d0bf1ce2d61eebbd0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e67fb799e4a85a7eaa70e064a2c38bd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9e50776c38d5ea754d2422eb69e8b41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eaa63d12f165bc1a301c9b301f9e63af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb0913112113c4d0f98413f4a796c085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eec6ecfa96c9ffc748c9367e9245abbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef5be72a988b819c55a8798a4e8a6d09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f3d29ddf388eb98ca1429332251688, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f75ac8b40091cbfdf806d9345180d4dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb9319de6a0623daa9ed60ae7c813b78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdbd02e0933fb17228956115d0b3881a"

We hypothesized that while asymptomatic carriage would not increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and graft loss, severe infection would. METHODS: All lung transplant cases between January 2000 and July 2013 performed at our center were reviewed for respiratory viral samples. Each isolation of virus was classified according to clinical level of severity: asymptomatic, symptomatic without pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Multivariate Cox modeling was employed to assess the impact of CARV isolation on progression to CLAD and graft loss. RESULTS: 4408 specimens were collected from 563 total patients with 139 patients producing 324 virus positive specimens in 245 episodes of CARV infection. Overall, the risk of CLAD was elevated by viral infection (HR 1.64, p < 0.01). This risk, however, was due to viral pneumonia alone (HR 3.94, p < 0.01), without significant impact from symptomatic viral infection (HR 0.97, p = 0.94) nor from asymptomatic viral infection (HR 0.99, p = 0.98). The risk of graft loss was not increased by asymptomatic CARV infection (HR 0.74, p = 0.37) nor symptomatic CARV infection (HR 1.39, p = 0.41). Viral pneumonia did, however, significantly increase the risk of graft loss (HR 2.78, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: With respect to CARV, only viral pneumonia increased the risk of both CLAD and graft loss after lung transplantation. In the absence of pneumonia, respiratory viruses had no impact on measured outcomes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/484fe506def5388c646a5a1202fda6ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/621ebecbc699f87c1cdcdc7726a58fff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88bb5c88ebd91538410d0e6e6d8160e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fcfb6fc31e4deff937f4cf04a09ba6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d326101e3b06f6635bd17dc719001019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e91e70168ec2ca69bc137f7f4de94465, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eef7c30603a8ae91089b2b891c6e22a5"

Colostral growth factors and hormones have beneficial effects on postnatal maturation and may affect substrate utilization and energy expenditure in neonatal calves. We tested the hypothesis that energy metabolism and its endocrine regulation differ during the first 10 d of life in calves fed either colostrum or a milk-based formula with a similar nutrient composition to colostrum, but largely depleted of bioactive substances, for the first 2 d postnatum. Male Holstein calves (n = 18) were fed either pooled colostrum (COL; n = 9) or a milk-based formula (FOR; n = 9) for the first 2 d of life. From d 3 on, all calves received same milk replacer. On d 2 and 7 of life, calves were placed in a respiration chamber for indirect calorimetric measurements to calculate heat production, fat (FOX) and carbohydrate oxidation (COX), as well as respiratory quotient. Blood was sampled on d 1 before first colostrum intake and on d 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, and 10 before morning feeding, to measure plasma concentrations of immunoglobulins, metabolites, and hormones. Additional postprandial blood samples were taken on d 1 and 9 at 30, 60, 120, 240, and 420 min after milk feeding. Liver samples were collected on d 10 of life to determine gene expression related to energy metabolism. Formula-fed calves showed lower plasma concentrations of total protein, immunoglobulins, haptoglobin, leptin, adiponectin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein (IGFBP)-4 during the whole study but temporarily higher plasma concentrations of urea, insulin, glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on the first day after feeding, compared with concentrations in COL. The temporary increase in glucagon, triglyceride, and cholesterol on d 1 reversed on d 2 or 3, showing higher concentrations in COL than in FOR calves. In FOR, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were lower on d 3 than in COL. Interestingly, FOR calves had higher heat production during respiratory measurements on d 2 and higher body temperature on d 2, 3, and 5 than those of COL. The hepatic mRNA abundance of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was higher in FOR than in COL. Our results indicate that first milk feeding after birth influenced whole-body energy expenditure but not FOX and COX in neonatal calves, and the absorption of colostral leptin and adiponectin might affect insulin sensitivity on d 1 of life.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/131762075db271606a7fa5624a3c037e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18cab205211fa8f67186492681b48197,

Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain this including issues of genetics, physiology, nutrition and management, and these factors have been investigated at the animal, organ and cellular level at critical time points of the productive life of dairy cows. This paper reviews the physiological events and their causes and consequences affecting fertility in dairy cows and summarises these in a downloadable poster. We consider the following points to have the greatest negative impact on fertility and that they need to be prioritised in efforts to ameliorate the problem (others have been included in the review). Firstly, minimise negative energy balance and resolve any infection of the post partum uterus. Secondly, expression and detection of oestrus followed by insemination with high quality semen (day 0). Thirdly, ovulation and fertilisation of a high quality oocyte (day 1). Fourthly, an early increase in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum (days 3–7). Fifthly, the uterine endometrium must produce an early and appropriate environment to stimulate embryo development (days 6–13). This leads to sixthly, a large embryo producing adequate quantities of interferon tau (days 14–18) that alters uterine prostaglandin secretion and signals maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 16–18). Future strategies to improve dairy cow fertility are needed for the benefit of the dairy industry and for cow welfare and should be based upon an integrative approach of these events.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c7db1a6b5b20aab822152f74970ca27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12bb40221c72a9902bae79125aa9f4c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/179bb897e1ddd9d8147f072127fbef34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22c6218cab018e78e5312667e15a7c15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28b79dfdbb480e0ca6b250ea0f6183e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a28e25b434f4a0a07be5260a7a1121a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cbb7d7a152ef26eab691de5ad736f1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3158f8b2250085cafd29aea1fa80ac62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ac12c50ea602389ecc5f0d407a6b84d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/460d593dd4159ca4fb8410ba7445af43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/481659fc2a1c58e606ecae3d2fb7fa5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ef13899cc714676f59bd98e888ee20f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5527eef7cf62c000bae4a37e3fe08aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fa4f036b53e11ff05d1d4c85a79d3d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/659f10555ab855bae9f25d93c3b7586d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/723c3ca56e20641961a101402d7f2a34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7aa1d49b46f1f20b70913c940c9eb760, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bd6650c01c23c2ecd2ab2cc6e7ad3b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80ad7941bb05650a3dceaa55f8b3642a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e83e286e3ffbf87041bfb1bca299303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/924f650b56eefc1b948e9af5e9fcef6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/962d02485a81d21082a681096f3d3e01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a09c2028131ca538d72b911201051c3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0ffdd72b435eda403c376763fc58d46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3f16502ac22b36945a1a978544243a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac2976cb1ef265667e5ef0c518a9c160, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b14a274f5e538a157b55148e6722f67a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1f0576433384fdf704f9c456506235f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5709f6442285e502c8d9e0664c1418f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8cf519735dd445936a84245dc15cf3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9d879a860f7cb65f2d1cb08c1d53a26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c795ca97a904b3705e9702215a3fc64e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb6b9a2e78ca3dc6d6af5c9da9f19e84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d71328492a59b53a4d1d3fcaad06ed3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de8e436fae07eabd242f132ac100ecc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dede0ffdb7fc16ff4eb39498c9440382, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e42cd545dffa9c69b40c0121c8108ce8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4b6c58af4a3eb124ae90618e5861d40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fad4d4c63903882bba77174970fb7029"

The genome consisted of 128,058 bp and had an overall G+C content of 40%. There were 130 hypothetical open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding proteins of more than 50 amino acids and covering 92% of the genome. Among all the hypothetical ORFs, 37 baculovirus core genes, 23 lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes and 10 genes conserved in Group I alphabaculoviruses were identified. In addition, the genome included regions of 8 typical baculoviral homologous repeat sequences (hrs). Phylogenic analysis showed that CapoNPV was in a distinct branch of clade “a” in Group I alphabaculoviruses. Gene parity plot analysis and overall similarity of ORFs indicated that CapoNPV is more closely related to the Group I alphabaculoviruses than to other baculoviruses. Interesting, CapoNPV lacks the genes encoding the fibroblast growth factor (fgf) and ac30, which are conserved in most lepidopteran and Group I baculoviruses, respectively. Sequence analysis of the F-like protein of CapoNPV showed that some amino acids were inserted into the fusion peptide region and the pre-transmembrane region of the protein. All these unique features imply that CapoNPV represents a member of a new baculovirus species.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1273440ff9e17b34a04171f8e697daff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a2118fbb51761e48b6a74b7d688d235, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dada270b3cb7db058723f7de7ad6041, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20a3c0eba3f22b0ea69b8bfacc31d4bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2debb996052c0585e73da1fc402f3464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f88d07c21fe578e6cf06c72422e9ad6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/351d0b6beaed98fc01421202f50d3764, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/380af2cb241634b1f487a63c016be4d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/403920df6f80c52986afeebb9778b3d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/412fab058a935557c52957093b10b071, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44bd65e99a31168e4dc9c013b86c3695, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5569a73aecebebb5411723e27db94a14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57cbe1f5151ea1c0793da90826cd8360, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57ef956d95022a2ba12e5150b17650c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e50336b33b96fcc6d2d051b65849e1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64e07bdfcd5825ea6ff86ec8e4850923, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70ee54df2305276ea5bde96e752735f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78c1b161827661b8bec68ca6d95a111e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8125fc81d1d38f9b85a8665dfcc26992, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b2e2139e29ae5ab15d6379a301977ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96a60352c7506349d0caa6cba68c85c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9aadbeaa3341c699fc8d6cf10c94d100, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4b152207644a8d4f8a1c978c10c9505, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a572bddd6964f67635de266f512c92c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a700b1fdb0f699d185b211a92fc7c17c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8c9f74c072eb99ad6ea39fa214116b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9757338e1f4f38be5cb501c80364547, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c9680d317a3352dc29ddc1937fbfca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9fbd60d6c19cc8483c7fb566725afed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb134dddae9a195316950ebfd5b73064, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccfcd629aa054ae38c25340f0c71ca0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/daaaba6cc9c760cf41093d824797ff89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dff326f6fcad642655eb56d11078130d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecdb82c89c4bb4371f34b10817bbf88a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef414d5a1884a70dd8bc7af1755a0798, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f25c1b3cd9532738a991cdb23c44d210"

The device is capable of providing high recovery rates even for microorganisms which are rather sensitive to physical and biological stresses. However, some mathematical procedure is required for realistic calculation of an actual concentration of viable bioaerosols in the air taking into account a rate of inactivation of targeted microorganisms, sampling parameters, and results of microbial analysis of collecting liquid from the sampler. In this paper, we develop such procedure along with the model of aerosol propagation for outdoor conditions. Combining these procedures allows one to determine the optimal sampling locations for the best possible coverage of the area to be monitored. A hypothetical episode concerned with terrorists’ attack during music concert in the central square of Novosibirsk, Russia was considered to evaluate possible coverage of the area by sampling equipment to detect bioaerosols at various locations within the square. It was found that, for chosen bioaerosol generation parameters and weather conditions, the new personal sampler would be capable to reliably detect pathogens at all locations occupied by crowd, even at distances of up to 600m from the source.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a842cfe41b1cec9fab2841366aad7ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c912b0ac09fe83f959e2084153cec35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8066ed67fbbbdff31238bbde1dd9217c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/813e1671ea77d3ed28de07ad620023f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83431ab2a34b8a879afce4378fa75f66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b7cff975063b8bcd2675daf04e70171, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92942f990c24c09b80feab79cd964d81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9edb7cbba75d34c1ae868ebb9116efc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aceb3722c72aa1882c69f9669b444c30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7d30db76b3769fba88d529275a15aaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf572c0e2d9b3caf6eb30ea547969944, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d40ef2fd24750376ddaf4002af6e07f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da4f098a92686345c05a3adc653ce250, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea8663cdc2e9fd1c7ba177b07b032a8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6f687cbba9a86f2d2dedc0571dcdfdd"

A 33.5 kilobase (kb) nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is in the 100–300 kb range. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps towards DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of the size constraints on RNP entities and the role of genome size in virus adaptation. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20–34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with the acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) encoded in the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in a monophyletic subset of nidoviruses. However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region including unannotated domains, and overall 41.1-kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, as well as key replicative domains. These domains may include functionally relevant substitutions rarely or never before observed in highly conserved sites of RdRp, NiRAN, ExoN and 3CLpro. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts, e.g. Ankyrin and Fibronectin type II, which might modulate virus-host interactions. PSCNV's greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features–impressive in themselves–attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/055146ba9e62a2414c3d4b7a6851412f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05e2c2051d9c893654d883ee6a5c5b01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0628d4727405f9b41f11f252e4ab8bac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a61bfb6db2204364b9459416d4b5cbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2685f4de7d3b86cb85364cc50660aa97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ba0ead3edc9dc20374d83d5c5803b0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e8971a1c29c44f02275f73585472ff5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/319a1eef97f79c84b493e7952b2e6fba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31d4bd83dff8d752061349f32d09eb70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32f078b89bd178782d423701a4e66770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39d2e14af9ce363b763b3bf19c22791d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e08406ae2c0cea81e191f6ed4a1dd62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45e4635c5a27fbe174fac917b33277dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52f1519702e96c2013b908df2880cb6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53cbb642edb56a3314ec0c6071c4c2d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61a76953845fd6d3051ef745dd8942ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67ebbbc949f74e24d0f51c7bcebcc1f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/767430386bc318d8fa519fff1ce5d1b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f3ab8eb6f999ed725ac44a660657c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e9bf8e0d9bbb94770bcdf1a6ebf374, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/789a405d2ecdac3e58e4aacbf10939d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79cbfae92589523c234ef85038ba4c58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a873a739b54a7a2db6ba9fc018cdd07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bff9f25498ff159f0783577333e24ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d6a43816b408d64b4258da3796775e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8352e9bf6fcdd7fc5796abf5375ce085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/844a61f30bb1442e46526951359ef455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c2caf111631736f48facb49697861df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8eb6ee3b6ec730f952f14a5dd779c7be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9603a1ff896b127207f71168ed3a7c74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98c5d33ed3c1dac260a8737d4f61650d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b1e849054da2da4662613f7ba602a5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a20ecd7743f3b325d3b8c9f10966cd60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7bf2a1005e777de06571af56d9501af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab015f3cc8e946f35f15a946acc87268, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8f524dfd6060ff77b2f1c34bd73ae1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baf23e6d7f57f2e4795e1ea06e7a45da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bba39f20f9500b25df8881b2d1534cea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbc8fb032cefcd4a900429afe1dec838, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1ad829ed497deeb50f964c201263ce4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d85c46c85d944fe1c9f8832ac6d0b54c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de7b4338a9cf003af4a5cdca5b48f12a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df3a9849251ada3a15d6fdf7669844e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df446b03e133ec9ea38a4a9c9d1b08dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dffef753ee020e5586e2f7b9a8379f50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecac5dc6f3130cc0e39130199020c8e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed97981e18e7a2a73c117eeb0bad8715, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f633caefc2e582f1fdfefdad2f65bd0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6e887cd4d515a880a69a37914fa9dae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcf75f33af5700c58d963aad6da95a7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd8236eb5a5afaf7774b335e1189c6b0"

The outcomes of FeLV infection in domestic cats vary according to host susceptibility, virus strain, and infectious challenge dose. Jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi) are small wild felids from South and Central America. We previously reported on FeLV infections in jaguarundis. We hypothesized here that the outcomes of FeLV infection in P. yagouaroundi mimic those observed in domestic cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the population of jaguarundis at Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo for natural FeLV infection and resulting outcomes. METHODS: We investigated the jaguarundis using serological and molecular methods and monitored them for FeLV-related diseases for 5 years. We retrieved relevant biological and clinical information for the entire population of 23 jaguarundis held at zoo. Post-mortem findings from necropsies were recorded and histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed for FeLV-positive samples. For sample prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare frequencies between infected and uninfected animals. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: In total, we detected evidence of FeLV exposure in four out of 23 animals (17%; 95% CI 5–39%). No endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) sequences were detected. An intestinal B-cell lymphoma in one jaguarundi was not associated with FeLV. Two jaguarundis presented FeLV test results consistent with an abortive FeLV infection with seroconversion, and two other jaguarundis had results consistent with a progressive infection and potentially FeLV-associated clinical disorders and post-mortem changes. Phylogenetic analysis of env revealed the presence of FeLV-A, a common origin of the virus in both animals (100% identity) and the closest similarity to FeLV-FAIDS and FeLV-3281 (98.4% identity), originally isolated from cats in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of progressive and abortive FeLV infection outcomes in jaguarundis, and domestic cats were probably the source of infection in these jaguarundis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003059399997a893b29522d2dc26aa28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0347659447b10e7fcf459fcba965382e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03e91b05e277bc82c240425b15ec6773, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04d8c0a587c52fbd4ac28b6ada835b1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c7328e674b893943766979510efe1b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12bb9d40c50fe1a1f3bf59af874c1377, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1402ea184ded4e7ae807949981f5fac7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb70934f383f8849dbc4cf01a40aa44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2226ebd454f24a8c1701ac2c8e29cc4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/250c5febe382385ad7a68339d33f8965, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/260fb5cb0a437f8136c32bc52b49eda4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f800b93a7c303d86a7485614479a63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c9f6bec843892ab8cbaf659877eee88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37a9f140089bba705c6c90a83d7d26a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39852ec549e497c11fb7440be24639cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1b9e5a115c0ca4499bce3b74bf1d50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/434fc95224378098bf927c82fd0cd4d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/458dd57d9cd933546d7f83e4f51610a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/474c57b694f8d0f16e60587d2b936e84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/504ae16206f429b8eb9d8146de4beb40, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/518e32dbbf068708613d78856a0e17b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54ebf4842a109d4dfc477ad01b84efeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/569ea740e1cacb80272b078a84ec3604, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/573a6e325ca5a72c30741deb4c2a23f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/574c04184172e221ad86a9ed22835b41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cc84a9ed8dfb1034bf74af72bb46bda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6409e2ded4ae61e776f4e5ab0ae43830, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/650a367b65ba5f8e92693bd07baa13a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6570cc2b2fa137676ce2b0747870f3bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6717d8b5cfc256b2b8fe0e0f3654388f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b8cc9fe46deeb9a60af022167dd396f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76278305363ce037cadeac89e8610570, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77d094675765fce858c796a34091625a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ea6846c20dcafd22f55f7e44ba49f7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f08856cc394bc02271a8f7df3d35d83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8640f8b6a58e4055dfaf5626dd3d4dda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89055444237a2f772ff565278489a531, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89c88de4a534d05d48941442d6c6a457, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8efe49adf3e94bbc6f6b41288dee0a98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93c1365bc01366794c073a65f84bf72c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/989150bc8974f829056b5234bd5e3e6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9db71bcd064ab814fd7367351b3b123c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fa5a99ef68d1957e7f5e0b37218b91c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1cb868c0833de22477816aca5a9a1fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1ee347592ebaab192809c2c0be30a30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a54d0815fb623b63d35f0fd27b83f478, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a553b2f4d12b3c725d7490c302040075, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5b7ef96b45b15b2557da6d061a5727e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a864580ede37329e4ab89cb793683409, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1a257ba593380f519c6f772707658c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3e1c02103a592fd0646b4ed3fd06c30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7c0e8de701d9ad139de30b5030756a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb43bee4e45b7604a48b7be80a127c07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bef83499dd5317e7ea958554608a7d7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e012f79c62ee6ed562723b23132af651, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3b17a1080b9d587efc13241bd2347fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6264f2bd81786f50092adb105cc5278, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e78fbb626b9b56a935ba2d153f27df8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efd9641fe4ad8f50121d099581038d8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9bb52687a62031205c23fdd5e73ed3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faf049f79a1b53bb0a8b99b3c78991dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc05227c71dfa4a29837ebc9075f746a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd812701f32f35b49a855db7188fcb96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe02ade847fdad8eafe6c95420786bc7"

However, the genomic basis of these phenotypes are yet unknown. Here, we report the first genome sequence and comparative analysis of peacock with the high quality genomes of chicken, turkey, duck, flycatcher and zebra finch. Genes involved in early developmental pathways including TGF-β, BMP, and Wnt signaling, which have been shown to be involved in feather patterning, bone morphogenesis, and skeletal muscle development, revealed signs of adaptive evolution and provided useful clues on the phenotypes of peacock. Innate and adaptive immune genes involved in complement system and T-cell response also showed signs of adaptive evolution in peacock suggesting their possible role in building a robust immune system which is consistent with the predictions of the Hamilton–Zuk hypothesis. This study provides novel genomic and evolutionary insights into the molecular understanding toward the phenotypic evolution of Indian peacock.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/051178532a679dde41af0e019a8be2a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0caf846906a2dced31cb0ac5d535b91d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16e3985dc53edb2aad006a1188c0edd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26f0a36d034366b3fbbea9b67e59a10d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27aefe18711acf687c12c339136464b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d3def4e6fd35ab8d211b9d2cdb3a91b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43ba34d2d9a681d454a018633749ab83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a30773fceb29d8b8e064c3f061a8ccb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5440944ff0f14dd15b98a134a27b3954, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54ba56296f50211f8ec5739e0410ac64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c19eeacc99492c975047d1a64ce71b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72cee395557727c68baef5bd1505c805, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7348db32755e1f89beb74284c70a1be6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a5805465d01ae2294452458f4197bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76abba2b8f930d202ad0c4a1bdca54cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8aff2c6ff7a9dcee5d429e58fd17431a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2014647320d47bc3e924ac44d5a9a8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3df7ecd9743058fea3741173d9e0dff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0217ede3027c3faed0dacdfa2918260, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e75b833b0ed9ceb9c74fd4069968c4b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8be4eaf4b4d0b9151a9646258b83d66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6adadae95774203fb6d77d67103ff47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdd663d673bea133f90f4b7ebae0f8b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffacf36d735abbc54bf82408c8460e9b"

A prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or reassortants of human influenza virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection. However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), were largely limited to this group. Extrapulmonary pathology may thus contribute to the morbidities induced by H5N1 viruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04e5fb070ef43a58ef0c2bbc6181fa54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cc0cea16e902e28aa379281a4b1c768, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c174f91183178f698b6913d813f6c44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/303ae14df8c2f5493e2bcb3543ec824a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3314970fcc43ab0e3c65ddc5a73a08ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33ba8282f11928f6ee7bfc7c8d7b5a33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3670c8d7afa89ec893e46c68d98d1f12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43dcf877e3aeb180f94a7be0451bca30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/471cf9c0ee48e1221553acd0577df86e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b6df8c81981ec7a3568542fc72d5414, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bb7bf2d9bd06ee39f55f2c7fb4fa81b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c8589ec57583e6344d5784e67b259ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57cc760a2f36357a30184475a0015ef7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59b9f64479e4ee113a292deed397004b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/655f68d22a8de22ccf5722c239d4d41e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/689838c02643a5ae9a22d01a3c72d13b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74def81c71b236e3afb2aa7a7b562421, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85848709305c34d694152f80aef3a20b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92571648ba7f4f3377c900a25fe1eee2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a960b93c25445be12bd7e05ee256f0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ee15fa6e91711d69ed5d6501fd36102, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac8dd357f2c762c95b5131917f87ee10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4effe69ccb32d861194b1bf3f28d02f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c59ef8cb582110bc67c4080e450851c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9b9593d79d4c92acdaa3511c878a66a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d36d11b06c6e0ed69e364a5ffea10172, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d759095e93c8aec42962f05ee68b9d45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1555c5dda9dd2e38ebcec3d3ce77ba0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e20ba1568dd56eebdb73796bba82e1a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5d013b42dac1580be235fb7bc68d21b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e678b3347034151ee63cb2677b24ed03, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b912283c6fa705b990d84b0bb67c38"

EV-D68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen; however, due to lack of a permissive animal model for EV-D68, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against EV-D68 has been hampered. Recently, it was shown that EV-D68 has a strong affinity for α2,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) and we have shown previously that α2,6-linked SAs are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection. Here, we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated EV-D68 strains (VANBT/1 and MO/14/49), along with the historical prototype Fermon strain (ATCC), to infect cotton rats. We found that cotton rats are permissive to EV-D68 infection without virus adaptation. The different strains of EV-D68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody (NA) upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization. Infection with the VANBT/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology. Intramuscular immunization with live VANBT/1 or MO/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses, but a moderate heterologous NA response. We showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of NA against VANBT/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy. VANBT/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from VANBT/1 challenge, but induced strong pulmonary Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology, indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization. In conclusion, our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis, immune response, anti-viral therapies and vaccines against EV-D68 infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02cf2b3a3fb978ee64c0b51f8b536164, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/072e915f6d8ecd7b5347712d70b4ed71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/088a55b6c55cbe9ff642a5b6c5217132, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13c6c9366c84af89e39749ed1bd2a6b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1626770212dbd2bce275ae36eae43ce5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fbad3fe1abe850bbbecaf30df9ee63c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/213ab66daea6d60871b710acfa5cf569, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27de5ee170fd72af34b0b7096b35de76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ba1600a1b2859bdf2bf4f899fbd75ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3be0e8467f075c7e1ce52c2510cf717d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41ba241af98af195a20839d3e1560519, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b1c205c2ea6279b133ec35c0f219564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b440e89b9931494860a87cef8cb38de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/509f62e282a8dbabdc4c1bd2f4d1ca88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53aac41104b4ab0dac7be4b079dc5a70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54d9e915d43383966b0483bf63234ccb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/583de816f67cbc552b1b7bf483d5adc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a93a0d0285e77f60901263a252fe98d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c0cf9d67e095360642d99a2859d6df0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f2ccf69c13541b0b2e07c14af904a9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64b16b4556ee3fa93dc9241b30321d16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6610d740f7e2ab6fd2ae0b92c099b606, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6738649843331e9219e00300845ec91d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/695b7dfc244bbf48ea2aee7c347c9d9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77ecade01379ed304db7def352e1f1af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a1221d8c6ca9fb822cc948c070117b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f1f43c6ccd2fe53131f78f584c4a528, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/820e61c6462b5e8946dd1f7a030c59e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cd0714ec50f84d2403cc5c2dbff7b07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bd3ff75b18e0e4694e6abdade41b32f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bdff34b88397edb61eb205728ac060e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ccf732bd5248839a5573fc682e478f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d1abfa913b974af5519e45b2517c4ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f3fa7955603e9443df1f9d46efdb1b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3bec1fa9ca6cb039da913d624e33f46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a51b8b4abd15cb161fccf0e7b2dcb6af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b08721d95900a1bcf2d0618054235cfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ed3089357a89f7179f2c431603d1e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b74f6ead52afa6fb4abab7ebff3fb78f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9d939eaa82f073c910ea427f1575144, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba82b4087f6e76ef19ac7d1e0e28c542, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc5e879a0290b102c67cbf1df3ad2200, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce68596ef4121724552320e180d21c95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0ed56ff5a2032a54bc7869ba8e6fa4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5e425366d131f4f71fa5869b92b548d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6fbca23536db4599800e956ef831e26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e495e39390d51ca6c6d3f8879f034da8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e61add5934cfd9892a9b6e75511b4da4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2aea63c37622861fb79dce0f93a677e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f544b71a637d9507d591ac00e550b60e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5a02d77de34e6bb4c9019892db09794, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f61b8e8e47a656981d3e1c07eeea43de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f807e2ff10e79b6dd6fc734691afd60d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f95182ea4e9007b54fb672534b993a2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe7e8934399a0ec9791c4db5f48395b6"

The objective of this study was to estimate the median amount of money ED personnel would be willing to pay for preventing nosocomial severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Methods A contingent valuation approach with close-ended format was used. During the study period from June 15, 2003 through June 30, 2003, a convenience sample of all medical personnel working in the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital was carried out. Participants were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and were asked to choose whether or not they would pay at a specified price to purchase a hypothetical SARS vaccine. A logistic regression model was created to evaluate the relationship between willingness-to-pay and the log of the price offered in the bid questions. The median and mean amounts of willingness-to-pay were calculated. Results A total of 115 subjects were interviewed and most were nurses (68.7%). The median and mean amount subjects reported being willing to pay for a SARS vaccine was US $1762 and US $720, respectively. Subject responses were significantly related to the price of vaccination and their type of job.

We hypothesized that an electronic nose (eNose) could fulfill this need. An eNose can discriminate various lung diseases through the analysis of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs). An eNose is cheap and noninvasive and yields results within minutes. In a single-center prospective cohort study, we included patients who were treated with chemotherapy expected to result in PCIN. Based on standardized indications, a full diagnostic workup was performed to confirm invasive aspergillosis or to rule it out. Patients with no aspergillosis were considered controls, and patients with probable or proven aspergillosis were considered index cases. Exhaled breath was examined with a Cyranose 320 (Smith Detections, Pasadena, CA). The resulting data were analyzed using principal component reduction. The primary endpoint was cross-validated diagnostic accuracy, defined as the percentage of patients correctly classified using the leave-one-out method. Accuracy was validated by 100,000 random classifications. We included 46 subjects who underwent 16 diagnostic workups, resulting in 6 cases and 5 controls. The cross-validated accuracy of the eNose in diagnosing IA was 90.9% (P = 0.022; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 83.3%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.93. These preliminary data indicate that PCIN patients with IA have a distinct exhaled VOC profile that can be detected with eNose technology.

These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. RESULTS: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14e355f101dcc99f555c0c8aa79bfdbe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28a9fe55ea863f927d0524e21a1fbf5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32c4017dc6389c5224c4fa2a400a1019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b2d05feb36627f3b10b9e7b7b58e214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f10b70369cb5b6983c029c5eeda7d17, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bea1e8492861286d70998d69f17f76a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60281eec2d886e17e789eac784b6b13d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/647f37238b747653148dd5c1d2e977af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65e80afa54ae6ffbc482ec445c730c32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f016e630b2ba477fa7f7f6b998037e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/958bfb2e407e19897ca2f3d7bca195db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96dcbf6cf5187fd5a9bc31105b50659c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a44032385bfcd6dea05861392c41d3be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5c2d078a2a33f49d35778f3ed75ae9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b977606872980ade719a6214287a75e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d202b031501a5ff619ddcffd3ed5bc39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4d0cb2c9c187be2e1500c486b0e86b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d72f6296c802001309d2d7ba7c9d2589, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de450a05e59570b9e07de11501e8dff2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edc66bcf4373d98d00f0722a83cbc80d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f03f41f9c5ae9577defdbaf758bd8776, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc4f82b8542985284459d915a25f87a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc97acfefef1dd172c1b88ea5916233e"

Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world. Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus. We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the Corona virus.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a6293db179da576930c17d7dc90347f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268e60ed8723ef1d97d523cd791aefa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50bc78df3f55dfee09a676523762652b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6738a87961f1848bf63a270c26e1b5b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7335044cc67504a568bae3b2e0cc5759, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75daee65b5b91b24a0c4eae165b5ec57, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fdef38325fb565775611e5dea924156, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae4267affe0620cce1640857cc49c5eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9e900c795ab9bd7b44e1e916a6e7ef4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c336bf88fbd6140ae76435aed889946e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5f0e1cb045ab0adf7d1d7b3824d6bb6"

We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, that is balance between commensals and potential pathogens, is involved in pathogen overgrowth and consequently disease. We compared oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients (n=100) with healthy elderly (n=91) by 16S-rRNA-based sequencing and verified our findings in young adult pneumonia patients (n=27) and young healthy adults (n=187). Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, P<0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls. Clustering resulted in 11 (sub)clusters including 95% (386/405) of samples. We observed three microbiota profiles strongly associated with pneumonia (P<0.05) and either dominated by lactobacilli (n=11), Rothia (n=51) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (n=42). In contrast, three other microbiota clusters (in total n=183) were correlated with health (P<0.05) and were all characterized by more diverse profiles containing higher abundances of especially Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella and Leptotrichia. For the remaining clusters (n=99), the association with health or disease was less clear. A decision tree model based on the relative abundance of five bacterial community members in URT microbiota showed high specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 84% (89% and 73%, respectively, after cross-validation) for differentiating pneumonia patients from healthy individuals. These results suggest that pneumonia in elderly and young adults is associated with dysbiosis of the URT microbiome with bacterial overgrowth of single species and absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria. Whether the observed microbiome changes are a cause or a consequence of the development of pneumonia or merely coincide with disease status remains a question for future research.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/00536829c7a8be90912e7a91eed8bbcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02b0ace72454b5334edcdff4d0cbd5ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/045f8fdeeac616aa906107396062e1a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/090426e96721cb710f481c036a0d3f13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09f1a04ea011b2597852c79fbee94b55, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a0494e6a242d376f6c387e580e59581, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/111af5d2df3881d01b003de286e1332a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a00ccec0ddfcea43d85593102da4721, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d6a8d3cdd18bdd1d833c14306090ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20907b2b69c99ecd662f1b39613af752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/230a30828218f83203a1a773c5e4789e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23de345d68a9aae091d6ef46d39eb50e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26d8b42c4316da3060b9eabdd64ad72f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2722d75f243f4cbefeef228093188f4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e8de438544f41fada72120a911b3c84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/354293431e1fce379d5dae22d8ec65de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41a7814ad4ca6e53c1e451deda89697d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45b57b3b12c71fcf92935114efe3c170, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4eb53828e5975faeeafdfda12cabd559, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ec926b81662b6f5d47b62321aa4687f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/547e590c6dde873e2ed31cec36adb3cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56006d93ffe33c030c0de597e5c3305c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f82dc181bdc5b3aac9932c705b0be62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63b800e4366d50f9a43196b3dd228e92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6625dbdcada5cfa16ca042d3ad76f782, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/776b206918c05623a1067e553a89512f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8482f6305374a09c3bf1940b096657ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a7468107029878979d4833a3b8022e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91f3a5eb12f702ef0e794b8646a069bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9720443bfe2b6eb018e774b4db0cb053, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ab4bedafcb071feb811b40de33ac1a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a04a5befd980891176640079844edc3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad620df1f9c2e50fdcd4c12356463caa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b15ea0ce57783199b35dfec7b33552d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5997c87e2c623ff7a94fe6b41c32a8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfc51545646187586290161ce693eb10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c77da6b4a02370a807dbfcc4e4885a75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7fb4353c3265e5387913da263d2c516, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df9d7b44437b6b4b70aa0328ca061b1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d4e71b1fce183d86fef6fc0ee3ffa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6178065e25237a7581312801cea1d6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d405655981410db74f3cc6406b977c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8913cabc779b1eb816866d7f2ee4acb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe97e770b9e294edfaa1952ad1944521"

A number of neurotropic viruses have been found to invade the brain through the OB. There is growing evidence that microscopic particles of toxic dusts can propagate from the nasal epithelium to the OB and further into the brain. These harmful agents impair cellular elements of the brain. Apparently, cells in the OB are the most affected, as they are the first to encounter viral infections and toxic particles. It is well known that neuronal and glial progenitors are continuously generated from neuronal stem cells in the subventricular zone of the adult brain and then migrate predominantly into the OB. Therefore, it is feasible to suggest that substitution of injured or dead cells in the OB by new-born neurons, differentiating from progenitors, plays a role in protecting the OB neuronal microcircuits from destruction. Furthermore, some cytokines and chemokines released in response to infection and/or intoxication can modulate different stages of neurogenesis (proliferation, migration, and differentiation).

However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge. These results demonstrate its potential for an improved MV vaccine candidate.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/307f2c5bc71c4a076983e0cfb9efbf4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a6e3b763bc3cb63eb06fa351af718d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50476430ade58cca30fbded726a44244, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b105e383918a8a5b13bd7232d01dea6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eaad14d34759e9d46c55e91fddf2bf8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7937693126c8b8d07fe4aa1eb525ff70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f9c7988cfa7dfd0f99f943506d90a08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/896c4b2cc93e20556d98117f3b455d9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cc3b30058cdd0af715277e0eb66bd49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a23359cf33b3f27fe7dc7938815a355e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a25c7a0c2b144911cb05bacf987d537e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abe72c00293d415b1489f0b7613d0248, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad04d6f1b792f51761fb49cbf1e272f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afdc12fd7b749bf1963b136f8db6fa35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1087f6f05c12b33378fb2379c542f75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db180dacc77a660e4bb9f40e15ca7527, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1f409e9a83f3b6a2d1f6b33e533c366, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e953b28ec53c81f924e151dcb77ff5fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef8edf5c4c035f03a7d4f3f2e87bc789, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8927f326cb072bd1c5902d8a1a0cc26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f0aa108e06bc49ed302845626c0b1b"

An early induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens as well as an infiltration of macrophage-like and cytotoxic T-cells was detected with immunohistochemical techniques in circumventricular organs, such as the median eminence, neurohypophosis, subformical organ, pineal gland and area postrema. These areas, which lack a blood-brain barrier, correspond to those showing early invasion of trypanosomes. In addition, there was a marked induction of MHC class I in neurons in two hypothalamic nuclei, The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Neurons in these two nuclei are located behind the blood-brain, but project to the neurohypophysis and to the medain eminence, thereby exposing their axon terminals to factors circulating in the blod or released locally from invading trypanosomes or from macrophages or cytotoxic T-cells. It is suggested that the alteration in the nerve cell bodies in the hypothalamic nuclei is caused by retrograde axonal signals from these target areas.

Apart from the pandemic virus that was responsible for most ILI cases, incidence rates of other viruses have varied among geographical areas. In general, human rhinovirus was the most frequent among individuals from the community, and respiratory syncytial virus among hospitalized patients. Detection rates of other respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, adenovirus or parainfluenza viruses have been much lower. On the basis of an interference mechanism, human rhinovirus may contribute to modulate the pandemic wave, although available data are not conclusive to support this hypothesis. In contrast, the epidemic wave of respiratory syncytial virus during 2009–2010 was similar to previous seasons. Overall, incidence rates of respiratory viruses other than influenza did not change significantly during the pandemic season compared to other seasons. No association has been found between coinfection of pandemic influenza and other respiratory viruses with the prognosis of patients with influenza. The involvement of clinical virology laboratories in the etiological diagnosis of ILI cases has improved and has optimized diagnostic procedures.",""

ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. ISG15 can be covalently attached to proteins, analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors. Specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their C-termini and substrate proteins. The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15. RESULTS: We have cloned and expressed 22 human DUBs, representing the major clades of the USP protease family. Utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and ISG15, we have identified USP2, USP5 (IsoT1), USP13 (IsoT3), and USP14 as ISG15-reactive proteases, in addition to the bona fide ISG15-specific protease USP18 (UBP43). USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB, and its ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: By evolutionary standards, ISG15 is a newcomer among the UbLs and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin. Functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/033c3abc1a1b429fc96ea47932a7c5a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/075308ee2e683e71ccae475c19bab55a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d0d930aa70acb7d8f3c778c8782a676, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11be38f5fdd95c1c06dc2e0f62bd8bb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1237d796302e3f730c0fc9f7c15dba07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/152afa8ad70f5b4d6633c8bd5ed99b90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb1decacab029a10d98fc48c8e769a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bb350f3171459bcbf401ee273436000, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2efcc9d8fac6d380824deea97d64bd32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/355fc5ce852e496b991cd7bd31413ab2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b25e006b45012f0ed20eb5bcd4f3375, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d7c26e8f3ce173645dcf2fdbbc70e65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ef17d671cc7fc097d809a20c9e92d3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41ca230381dd17507f6482c00d9cc7c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4395b576792c39bb2e37ab7e0ed64ce4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4657001ea7aaa0b5b23d526cd2a7b549, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49f94d64444a57d014df4152c123028c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60d035cd45f3fa31cf3eeced1ed38d3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68cd8e75e48ba9b83541cd605a399cf2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a4b5d7ba18ea412672ea7363a1b8039, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a4db356bb1306e253261e22b344d82d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72f0c756a7ef89b27f7b879300ad835a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7336cab7fe7a4a6d0a1686776ecf8182, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75035a21ca6bd6e2c7a5aaf53af4567b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e9dd15eda4fd2a4d090cbad686895ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8089a83de289d243acb42669d7bcc00a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919796f710cb81ecb194881cfa4caada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9669a38470475e62173205f9ab30370f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4b7b59a60678deed7d4194642213e47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5ad1e21a76bd9a77473a5a062cc70b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7aff3e87395e7d229c6ac693ec74baa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afeadc40908ff985b9a42be39c735e48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b73544d297cf6b5c4ebd9f1d51d8b695, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b848043f4f207d890e67e845c866e08b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd3825c116f122f42cacff0aaae2d56f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c818744907db2f82669d1859c234aa91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8b8b597a89a1393bceec139f64c9243, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc02b5aebb06a77bb307d14477635853, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0c253bc5dd45e11fc72d8935f62acea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3553789833c6c558ca00c73e04e51c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7781f9a6d1ff7980844e52682b0163c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e83a3c3418eebc0ff599e2bc1b71072b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea103ad0da4a97f54e43c10f0f674a0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eced62add1d7009f204cc58c19c8aa33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0dcdd8fbeb4054c65225fe79270ec18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbd886e3d000b0b2623740e3abf2a3bb"

Monoclonal antibodies specific for IFN-γ, CD4 and CD8 molecules were administered in vivo to deplete selectively the IFN-y synthesized or the appropriate subset of T cells. The animals were then infected with MHV3 and the course of infection was followed by studying different parameters, such as, the mortality, the virus growth in the tissues and the IFN-γ synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates. After MHV3 infection, a full resistance of control A/J mice was observed, in contrast to the high mortality rate observed among the depleted animals, where higher virus titers were found in different tissues. The IFN-γ synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates of depleted mice, after MHV3 infection, drastically decreased when compared to that detected in control mice. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that IFN-γ plays an essential role in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV3 infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b717ce70ef37441dcde746e3ec0fbaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/161895e1b0493ca5d06adc64f4893e1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a069fb9b4ac4aad3587c3b6d971fa80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b66db69ce4ecdac82f9f87d07704e43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30a6789539f315255d68ab807fdd7733, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39e8292ea69547c62deac1c0d542e130, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c79b66cd3cc7baa615c81d10040eaa6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55891a35ca7a9e2d3aeb7f4deef6d9b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d8652c06702c5a760488e1f22808987, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/742c34083ed6a01eedce629f4996c056, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e55d072c1f68017d54758ad0bb7c0a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84657ea05fbadff258810a0604693586, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e47528f7c0bc1443f649ee8a791f6db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5bcfb59bb7d946a45af86c137d756bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa968abbc6018437259dcc20a3b2e459, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1ed2ff2f2be031dd39ab393395548b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca12afb2c75fb27639a0a2d53e66800f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccc09bd1b1b2d9750b901ff9cac6ee83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2ff9de74141f2406539ae2baa22957d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6f5fcf5d680d113171f16ca162be80e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb189ead8a8f80f4929e84656e62da8d"

Exposure to live poultry is a risk factor for H7N9 infection. Public psychobehavioral responses often change during progression of an epidemic. METHODS: We conducted population-based surveys in southern China to examine human exposure to live poultry, and population psychological response and behavioral changes in the two waves. In Guangzhou, an urban area of Guangdong province, we collected data using telephone surveys with random digit dialing in May-June 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. In Zijin county, a rural area of the same province, we used door-to-door surveys under a stratified sampling design in July 2013 and again in December 2013 to January 2014. All responses were weighted by age and sex to the respective adult populations. FINDINGS: Around half of the urban respondents (53.8%) reported having visited LPMs in the previous year in the first survey, around double that reported in the second survey (27.7%). In the rural surveys, around half of the participants reported raising backyard poultry in the past year in the first survey, increasing to 83.2% participants in the second survey. One third of urban subjects supported the permanent closure of LPMs in the first and second surveys, and factors associated with support for closure included female sex, higher level of worry towards H7N9, and worry induced by a hypothetical influenza-like illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated high human exposure to live poultry and low support for permanent closure of markets in both urban and rural residents regardless of increased worry during the epidemic.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04eacf9d1b728184fe9ad05442d4f61c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/392acc38238f4b5c4916ff9ab100795d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4009c8b086ee04dc4ca1832afff96618, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a34a3fb69846ae765c0208e61b5f72de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4bfb1e4331c2b25c3afd8c6e90e8128, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b79643153266fd3a09d435fb8187999f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e228b0752789ba764f14bf0a7e92546b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3c668ddefe1a674c19708d102867cc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fba34598888062cb2bcd1be6f7478be1"

Results from many studies have convincingly demonstrated that the basic molecular mechanisms governing programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting are almost identical from yeast to humans. We are interested in testing the hypothesis that programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting can be used to control cellular gene expression. Toward this end, a computer program was designed to search large DNA databases for consensus −1 ribosomal frameshift signals. The results demonstrated that consensus programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals can be identified in a substantial number of chromosomally encoded mRNAs and that they occur with frequencies from two- to sixfold greater than random in all of the databases searched. A preliminary survey of the databases resulting from the computer searches found that consensus frameshift signals are present in at least 21 homologous genes from different species, 2 of which are nearly identical, suggesting evolutionary conservation of function. We show that four previously described missense alleles of genes that are linked to human diseases would disrupt putative programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift signals, suggesting that the frameshift signal may be involved in the normal expression of these genes. We also demonstrate that signals found in the yeast RAS1 and the human CCR5 genes were able to promote significant levels of programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting.

It contains a highly conserved hydrophobic region (amino acids 524 to 539) located 24 amino acids downstream of the N terminus of the Ebola virus GP2 subunit. Comparison of this region with the structural features of the transmembrane subunit of avian retroviral GPs suggests that the conserved Ebola virus hydrophobic region may, in fact, serve as the fusion peptide. To test this hypothesis directly, we introduced conservative (alanine) and nonconservative (arginine) amino acid substitutions at eight positions in this region of the GP2 molecule. The effects of these mutations were deduced from the ability of the Ebola virus GP to complement the infectivity of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking the receptor-binding G protein. Some mutations, such as Ile-to-Arg substitutions at positions 532 (I532R), F535R, G536A, and P537R, almost completely abolished the ability of the GP to support VSV infectivity without affecting the transport of GP to the cell surface and its incorporation into virions or the production of virus particles. Other mutations, such as G528R, L529A, L529R, I532A, and F535A, reduced the infectivity of the VSV-Ebola virus pseudotypes by at least one-half. These findings, together with previous reports of liposome association with a peptide corresponding to positions 524 to 539 in the GP molecule, offer compelling support for a fusion peptide role for the conserved hydrophobic region in the Ebola virus GP.",""

The process begins when the bacteria aggregate in mucus secretions outside the light organ. The cells eventually leave the aggregate, enter the light organ, and encounter a rich supply of peptides. The need to dissociate from mucus and presumably utilize peptides led us to hypothesize that protease activity is integral to the colonization process. Protease activity associated with whole cells of Vibrio fischeri strain ES114 was identified as the product of a putative cell membrane-associated aminopeptidase (PepN). To characterize this activity, the aminopeptidase was cloned, overexpressed, and purified. Initial steady-state kinetic studies revealed that the aminopeptidase has broad activity, with a preference for basic and hydrophobic side chains and k(cat) and K(m) values that are lower and smaller, respectively, than those of Escherichia coli PepN. A V. fischeri mutant unable to produce PepN is significantly delayed in its ability to colonize squid within the first 12 h, but eventually it establishes a wild-type colonization level. Likewise, in competition with the wild type for colonization, the mutant is outcompeted at 12 h postinoculation but then competes evenly by 24 h. Also, the PepN-deficient strain fails to achieve wild-type levels of cells in aggregates, suggesting an explanation for the initial colonization delay. This study provides a foundation for more studies on PepN expression, localization, and role in the early stages of squid colonization.",""

The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent downstream open reading frames encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and downstream open reading frames affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the −1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by >4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a “golden mean” model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins.",""

However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs. Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis. As a consequence, recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs, for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0302c1a618115f86729a9c36ab8de38a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1120813e25d3a27fd6789b228cf6d51a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/132b28ec71a15f7e472384cb76fa4e22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14329ab8eb72d56ebaf6b8fbce4fc638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b75bfb6a56a6c2ad03ebcb02041f9d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d19aabeccdf8d303f6a10cb62c5fdb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38d98908a4ce071ea7d4cff9848da99b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/446398bde865fb79fab07082e28a3179, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/475995c4ffd7b76b9fe20fd6d5ce5edd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b132e06a10f8be83333959b5237018c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b53a60b378746909de624d09c2d4434, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/527845164bf91fdfdcc4d8cce4f8c9fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/554bc8d9de9bacdcf21c732238ab4dbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5750cd5c022665d062b9d08e397fd74b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c8fa9040e6ae7c1ae56da2cd5819564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e3f6665e11c467c71243a16272e647d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/706da69ad337e8dc439e7a7bfc52b1df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a22481dc1ff2007cbb112bd61916f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e204668fdc3ec62aa3fb391baec7c53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94376a7e2981f973beef549921bafb4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b1b7512bc1e6b4a6bf4bf8479d050fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f8728fd00076d4e12844006184c92fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f8b0a6475fc1c2a8f49ac8867d8a0c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a000b369a815c4e450ed1cdc43c7dd3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a703e8c64b742d197f4aca6e3dd2163e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b399643d791f1f96db1b89010fd6668e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4b037e900d9c1f38cbfdd2e3f0522b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b990fc0bb2daab7130ee275712268cf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf053fe4a61a16e9ad595fd5ac30a562, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c16da0937180c1440cd979ffa938c0f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7dc919d9b6293e57ad7e38074935de4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb143786d0f8b97c78a84caa3b18b2be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d54a37563839317a0673815cd09161fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5d031f20f78c7d12a10ec2abe7fd7f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d64fe32d2ef05ad8f7f06ff4811053fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8929c5e334b30780a1cec81c4c85e68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e916b5683ac667d81d017e446742cb3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb0c817f21ec800466297101c467c021, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3a43fc955574e77086c58378d32a744, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4cc5964b95d56d0992bd205d70826eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9cac73e61bbac0254966d6e9497c5d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcfd16166512c7e0f7d9276ba2fc3aeb"

HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/105bec446667c78bc57296289b207d75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/145a0b43d02b839c44461c6eb18f43a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14f8d38d0a2bdb61f04264d2cabedbb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15882209165abd66ccd57f1f65a62442, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c4cc66fc90a500c863fbbaa6d612bc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f8582fb08106d6c050ae2e8fa2cc53a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f973f9cbed26b7f4ae650eb0bdd4d69, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/274024aca0a5a5dfcaaa8b1787442ab6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d1cc031687d5202b255101d19d2fcdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f4bd56b474d4d804f91178bb25d0de8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/305b446bc20bce8940d483a626f0ed35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/337c1dc8d35661f805dac327c3181b25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33c5fef4fa33a9188ae5a7870cba5b42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39b0cbc54601333ae5b7fc3dce97f3ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fbc512916fed3d05085eb34811049e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5422d1af3625ccb53971f50f8de69ea8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54eb39117e9f160483da81bae175fffa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/557b83d14f7f13f71fc2cbccb418e891, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5891c67ea49ee27bacbc27ae906d2bef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f523f730b43ae5ddd7291ff93a86fc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60f425d99ace279db4524366d0f9f945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6217d4d04eb8cd86fe7991b98ca468fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/650471322a9055d95aeac7f21845c7a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a2a0eff062a123eec54db64f7c15fc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8210ab71f1c5c93a5260bb24c8aa4df2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f46ed1ed00a78345cfca52f9d784e41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b3acde4c81f3f5a5087b36da6a786b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac8ac34cebf2141dd290671fa307d378, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b00679fa1c3d0fd049bb7f920234fdd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0077bde57972ff05712cfd8b4147be8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5e169ef27bf4bb296ca79327cdbd396, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd59eeec3a1fe11523b560ffe4c162d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cca7d7a16f4041368a0d4d96c62385d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1c744c6ede28e2b25a75a082dfd2e59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de56b2371be45b9434ca083bdaa509a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed5378578a698b8f926ac55eb254aa95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f51a248f2ba0148f5292ce8641093eed"

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the prototypical inflammatory disease of the CNS and is characterized by widely distributed inflammatory demyelinating plaques that can involve the brain, spinal cord and/or optic nerves. Optic neuritis (ON), inflammatory injury of the optic nerve that frequently occurs in patients with MS, has been the focus of intense study in part given the readily accessible nature of clinical outcome measures. Exploring the clinical and pathological features of ON in relation to other inflammatory demyelinating conditions of the CNS, namely MS and neuromyelitis optica, provides an opportunity to glean common and distinct mechanisms of disease. Emerging data from clinical studies along with various animal models involving ON implicate innate and adaptive immune responses directed at glial targets, including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and aquaporin 4. Resolution of inflammation in ON is commonly observed both clinically and experimentally, but persistent nerve injury is also one emerging hallmark of ON. One hypothesis seeking evaluation is that, in comparison to other sites targeted in MS, the optic nerve is a highly specialized target within the CNS predisposing to unique immunologic processes that generate ON. Overall, ON serves as a highly relevant entity for understanding the pathogenesis of other CNS demyelinating conditions, most notably MS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09f2422ca47b7bd1bbaa2424c756269d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/118192608a41721a586edf52f033a638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/149567c22deea7effd4ab6b06803dd91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15bef50292e4ab98a71759ba79fe455f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1846aff5d6e8afd6e6b6906c02a3c04d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ae2f1a54c65ed2f24cc18fa00b1afb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dfbdb38f121b88fab349fc65885f6fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ee33877786326e39ade1539c3c1bf45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2155aeb7b4d7f0a50b4c36ab10138bdc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268802fe13d8a3b50d30f20cc6a56ea0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29efe34db8c0316102146c9115c29909, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d35220049f0ed95c6ec2550c6ef2d07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3447bcbd2306bf34d7089b93d0d7b7a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39ea62285e752b0415b5fd1119b1cce4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40c5ada0703199d7cb3c23db15158202, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a9ea2f93e1e62fac62419d32870e245, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51424a1aad45598812621b47334525bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55b29529f1826ef49b70d6496bfa6b43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65ae504831130efddd942ec5b4cbe496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c75ef0664006077ac9757840829ef53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f968cde74cf09ba6317babf290f9825, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81d427c727c08ba43d7b527c49cef7d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8abec59655fa21016ece1bbf3e8d1b94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8adc0c33efd414be61192b539a116fad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b953d944be5ff690903beda38766cea7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c60dae19d5cdcc16b1c030a8542b4a18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c853bc9be96646541aaadae76583197e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8bb017ea3fc713b6648f7b0631af81f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d48bf575e5f935b9642e6f9448dd7675, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d983291f89d437050a0124189c189467, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcaa87fa59cfdfe548aca0cee01cb682, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8fa13279614effd214e85aa690d8585, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fab9441666477efe47b9e1049ae671e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff0dcc361f4669330e17baf261336398"

Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear. It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and into the CNS. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c52720554feb3c30fc8b991642f9d5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ce1e867bbf04c9a6569cc0f72b6a1a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d4f89c7ab17ce0e0549e6fba382ff8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/150b82e095b43670280de69b5c0db1a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/151cdf3c03dc7b8e44daee18a68fc24b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19594aeaccb9a50dd5ce046e3e6f6c36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a8c2584341ff2f6641b4c9f384b87ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1decc9fa23d54fec4159c395dca5c043, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21240a8d8748aca3766c3990c58fdbbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/268ffb5e0a72cac73eb1fcac6c4791c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a9a43cd7c34c2840a426bc4b371e13e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2df8ce5691660a0b2ec092a6a4eeb031, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b148bfb8171fc8a7c52c268f862083f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/425259c05482d82fe6cfbe98f9b4ee85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/528f3d17917fc922779e0f093344546c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ab30a3b0af41cec9ea5ff796f97f438, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a9ee9b88dca5df1258e542b8bdf0bd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92cdf96ba5587cdc518d2c9217888267, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f7568bb2d4af38b9941f5fba48ee0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9726048de2780d743e16708eb72c3fd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab49c38599086959579a4bb484c46a42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aec9a7a6ce7a93100501af0a2806f783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b02edb79a7c68db475ff573e899730f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2aec023a194b52bc1994450d82ac529, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf67c3c63f6d437d48fa2e24fbe1011c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfff34dde2cd8d989ffb3d46d02137b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d037c92d083bdbcf8aab5c71ce73adde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4b17629807b2c8f4d808e97c129bbe9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6eb80124904d19712848bd0c0562cb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e966fee029b8eaecc30983e42cdea1f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecd97590ef6805aff9f4b2c76eb568a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f839229cca3d09933f35d456487d17a3"

Since neurovirulence may be determined at the early stages of infection of the central nervous system (CNS), we hypothesize that it may depend on the ability of the virus to induce proinflammatory signals from brain cells for the recruitment of blood-derived inflammatory cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the interaction between coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus) of different neurovirulences with primary cell cultures of brain immune cells (astrocytes and microglia) and mouse tissues. We found that the level of neurovirulence of the virus correlates with its differential ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 12 [IL-12] p40, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-1β) in astrocytes and microglia and in mouse brains and spinal cords. These findings suggest that coronavirus neurovirulence may depend on a novel discriminatory ability of astrocytes and microglia to induce a proinflammatory response in the CNS.",""

Our results suggested that two selection mechanisms were operating: (i) the eggs selected specific sperm; and (ii) the second meiotic division in the eggs was influenced by the type of sperm that entered the egg. Furthermore, the proportion of MHC-heterozygous embryos varied over time, suggesting that non-random fertilization was dependent on an external factor that changed over time. As a higher frequency of heterozygous individuals correlated with an uncontrolled epidemic by MHV (mouse hepatitis virus), we suggested that MHV-infection might have influenced the outcome of fertilization. Here, we present an experiment that tests this hypothesis. We infected randomly chosen mice with MHV and sham-infected control mice five days before pairing. We recovered the two-cell embryos from the oviduct, cultured them until the blastocyst stage, and determined the genotype of each resulting blastocyst by polymerase chain reaction. We found the pattern that we expected from our previous experiments: virus-infected mice produced more MHC-heterozygous embryos than sham-infected ones. This suggests that parents are able to promote specific combinations of MHC-haplotypes during fertilization according to the presence or absence of a viral infection.",""

By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole primary data source. Integrating various sources of information, however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed reconstructions of transmission trees.

There is a hypothesis that disorders of musculoskeletal system as part of HMS arise in consequence of changes in spinal motor neurons. The study was aimed at bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome changes in lumbar spinal cords of mice after a 30-day spaceflight aboard biosatellite Bion-M1 (space group, S) and subsequent 7-day readaptation to the Earth’s gravity (recovery group, R) when compared with control mice (C group) housed in simulated biosatellite conditions on the Earth. Gene ontology and human phenotype ontology databases were used to detect biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and human phenotypes associated with HMS. Our results suggest resemblance of molecular changes developing in space orbit and during the postflight recovery to terrestrial neuromuscular disorders. Remarkably, more prominent transcriptome changes were revealed in R vs. S and R vs. C comparisons that are possibly related to the 7-day recovery period in the Earth’s gravity condition.

Therefore, virological surveillance of animals and particularly great apes is of great interest to establish the repertory of viruses associated with healthy hosts. This will further help to identify the emergence of new viruses and predict the possibility of interspecies transmission. In this study, we performed shotgun viral metagenomics on stool samples collected from seventeen free-living wild gorillas from the Republic of the Congo. The analysis revealed the presence of novel RNA viruses (picobirnaviruses, partitivirus, and Picornavirales (posa-like and dicistrovirus-like viruses)). Among these, picobirnavirus-related sequences were abundantly covered in the stools. Based on genetic variations both in capsid and RdRp proteins of picobirnaviruses, at least 96 variants were identified and most of them were novel. Among the 96, 22 variants had a nearly complete genome or segment. A comprehensive sequence analysis identified a potential new genogroup/genetic cluster and the presence of a short linear amino acid motif (ExxRxNxxxE) in a hypothetical protein. The sequence analysis of posa-like virus and dicistrovirus showed that these two viruses were novel members in the respective viral families. In conclusion, the identification of novel RNA viruses and their genetic diversity increases our knowledge about viruses that are associated with stools of wild gorillas and contributes to the initiatives in the search for potential emerging zoonotic viruses.

In this study, we observed that LT markedly increased the circulating soluble P-selectin (sP-sel) levels and microparticle (MP) count in wild-type but not P-selectin (P-sel, Selp(−/−)) or P-sel ligand-1 (PSGL-1, Selplg(−/−)) knockout mice. Because sP-sel induces a hypercoagulable state through PSGL-1 pathway to generate tissue factor-positive MPs, we hypothesized that the increase in plasma sP-sel levels can be a self-rescue response in hosts against the LT-mediated suppression of the coagulation system. In agreement with our hypothesis, our results indicated that compared with wild-type mice, Selp(−/−) and Selplg(−/−) mice were more sensitive to LT. In addition, the recombinant sP-sel treatment markedly ameliorated LT-mediated pathogenesis and reduced mortality. As a result, elicitation of circulating sP-sel is potentially a self-rescue response, which is beneficial to host recovery from an LT-induced hypocoagulation state. These results suggest that the administration of sP-sel is likely to be useful in the development of a new strategy to treat anthrax.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03e73b24386280e3b039daf1a1c210c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c5bf77262604cd85545b976d7bb436e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d34a42220ca9d41f4766860f7ad629e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19d781524d47398ce374ce2dffafc242, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fd8a72376fa36291e3f8eb905d92055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3315f7c757ba03068a91d168a321aadf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35dfd424f372e6c9c38fe472d8fe8748, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3849bb58a6b44afd2b6b9b2eafd0f989, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39eab8806075f985c47679a252be3d9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f348c7db98488ddfc555e67270e99b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56c9dcc9f9f12c033a9c8773812593f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5acaf7c2a31a922505a3cf62a0ba442c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7057a768db3c6feed028d35f291712b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73b7a35c844f5c7e7e40c19e49e1d2d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8926b6d439e3456967f8666115f3b2af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b32237be6317cabba983ced6bcb87d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/972b9ea977df87ed512bd660d22d8887, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b22ad1d83f23fdfa0a24ea2465fc57e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4c3c915a74df52208a3934935e7f2b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c887cb32b4a84d1fcbef054b8c95e027, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdb45cb54b523b634a710a8228f0d74f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dac1aac91a78a409919058c6dc836f4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc0c35f9abdd2da5ed0756c91c772fc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7435a1fae5bab726375b64d6853deac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec9e580a22002a94b9d6201bd232a45f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee99ed53515fc3ef5848faa4d2a65a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f52f6299f9a303a14cd5823f2f1e4584, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd323d1dd98ab4b8005421c437a71f92"

ZEBOV primarily targets mononuclear phagocytes, which are activated upon infection and secrete mediators believed to trigger initial stages of pathogenesis. The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular response.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/037256803012d4c4c1e328e2b1bec38e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0494448c6d57dd6de2060415e2f44473, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07be345b860bad178ec2589b098f0d68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24b712f6a96d682f69ab595eeac088f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25dde6d653b7f984fdfc6cb95731c3de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b50ba435208026e20d48014f844c021, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f9b12d03e3365f23720b68c8fb612d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36221be6f7b5ebb14dc7fa6733aa25a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e9667c64be87f2123e866040577c2e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f7691fe34f99c9ac59543d1f0397c9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b11f3ef04c036acdbc80d1627292879, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b398ec5b6be827db067efcee7f69ae6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59d410bb6abeecfda9d9b645602a95be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f535582c9db81e4a4216b823589214c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6258a8f54bacb86a84596a546a56206d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/672189243f4a40c34f34fdaab064dc43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6754fec3142174130802b3d78d95dec2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/783a08c5b70a9c41909d20b697ee5f0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80e5c00ea4d1cc9a9a396f6f32e16a09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83098f964f9c44096b9faed5a906a14b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bba45f06030a6949170f31929ef68a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/922809afdf2e66fcb94e139e89216700, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acbc272ef9ad79d8a1cd7fa7d7bd1880, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adb1b18da3a09877a23bc5b5fc4c9999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b45132ad10bab4e8fc81c5d161b05bc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbcf2f2f225c21971f6a50bd0f2ce1a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c620c254ffc984479d0aceaccd988d2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8eb4c82983d324b87a6473991d1b5e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc52307e2c1526616970900255edc39a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e541e994b3838e04faafc92f4c922f4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5605c7412f295818292f5da4e2414cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2df741159e777d5b91fe296747882ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f349e251cfeded24dcafb5de4ccf391f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3b58373f906153f352e558b7bfb1e62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fae9b8f565fc86cd4922b39caab37af9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fecd32815d3df1bfa326870c932b9e48"

We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous remyelination in the toxic nonimmune model of lysolecithin-induced demyelination can be enhanced by manipulating the inflammatory response. In PBS-treated SJL/J mice, the number of remyelinating axons per square millimeter of lesion area increased significantly 3 and 5 weeks after lysolecithin injection in the spinal cord. However, methylprednisolone or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), SCH94.03, developed for its ability to promote remyelination in the Theiler’s virus murine model of demyelination, further increased the number of remyelinating axons per lesion area at 3 weeks by a factor of 2.6 and 1.9, respectively, but did not increase the ratio of myelin sheath thickness to axon diameter or the number of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in the lesion. After 3 weeks, the number of remyelinating axons in the methylprednisolone or mAb SCH94.03 treatment groups was similar to the spontaneous remyelination in the 5 week PBS control-treated group, indicating that these treatments promoted remyelination by increasing its rate rather than its extent. To address a mechanism for promoting remyelination, through an effect on scavenger function, we assessed morphometrically the number of macrophages in lesions after methylprednisolone and mAb SCH94.03 treatment. Methylprednisolone reduced the number of macrophages, but SCH94.03 did not, although both enhanced remyelination. This study supports the hypothesis that even in toxic nonprimary immune demyelination, manipulating the inflammatory response is a benefit in myelin repair.",""

Here, we addressed the hypothesis that red tint alters the circadian nocturnal melatonin signal and circadian oscillation of other metabolic and physiologic functions. Female nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1(rnu); n = 12 per group) were maintained on a 12:12-h light (300 lx; 123.0 μW/cm(2); lights on 0600):dark regimen in standard polycarbonate translucent clear or red-tinted cages. After 1 wk, rats underwent 6 low-volume blood draws via cardiocentesis over a 4-wk period. Plasma melatonin levels were low during the light phase (1.0 ± 0.2 pg/mL) in rats in both types of cages but were significantly lower in red-tinted (105.0 ± 2.4 pg/mL) compared with clear (154.8 ± 3.8 pg/mL) cages during the dark. Normal circadian rhythm of plasma total fatty acid was identical between groups. Although phase relationships of circadian rhythms in glucose, lactic acid, pO(2), and pCO(2) were identical between groups, the levels of these analytes were lower in rats in red-tinted compared with clear cages. Circadian rhythms of plasma corticosterone, insulin, and leptin were altered in terms of phasing, amplitude, and duration in rats in red-tinted compared with clear cages. These findings indicate that spectral transmittance through red-colored cages significantly affects circadian regulation of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and physiologic parameters, potentially influencing both laboratory animal health and wellbeing and scientific outcomes.",""

However, the impact of natural colds on children with asthma in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well defined. Objective We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. Methods We studied 53 children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan, during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for 1 year. Symptom score, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal aspirate biomarkers, and viral nucleic acid and rhinovirus (RV) copy number were assessed. Results Of 658 aspirates collected, 22.9% of surveillance samples and 33.7% of respiratory illnesses were virus-positive. Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds (symptom score ≥5) showed reduced forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25%-75%), higher nasal messenger RNA expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and higher protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10 and C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL)-2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24. Children with mild (symptom score, 1-4) and asymptomatic infections showed normal airway function and fewer biomarker elevations. Virus-negative cold-like illnesses demonstrated increased FeNO, minimal biomarker elevation, and normal airflow. The RV copy number was associated with nasal chemokine levels but not symptom score. Conclusion Urban children with asthma with high-symptom respiratory viral infections have reduced FEF25%-75% and more elevations of nasal biomarkers than children with mild or symptomatic infections, or virus-negative illnesses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03e4a2d35c95b317341a053b897973b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05c3219e63d7835f767d368a562d3fd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/162d80acfd47eb908fbb226223477fdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1654f116633cd165149b096ab1839db3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/272997847e33077efa9e65e2490ad325, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bd88d265c8b86e4262f19c146612fa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d94568bba69a07e56a491f1218df3b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ea9d3c2db2c0cbe81a6d1e1c873f493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/390849e4024b847a5fbfec5eef6ca2d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4134af01ece8871cb7f7f697ffa2cabf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/418c4e6ff81cf1012716b568874fe0e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44acfbb6a05b542018bf3e4276eb2ebb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/494ba7d83afcba4441498bf7f2f55784, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bb3fb860188eb531d5c2865f9b47255, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f5e432f4e1fb11b1f4675078c4194cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51ed6089a81d6ccb3d4b5e3b09ad79f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5227fecb7b595fee7ab90919c9b81d0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54206dbf1095ad50bbbe7e1a37d29ea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/545390c9309651516ebfaa9406913889, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58eab08c3769fc05d7091ace8061dda4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b2b1b5b6ccf1a42dbd8b0d367714355, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5edf92c3036ef096ba1c8e3c8ff5bf33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/612cabc5402af87507c4f741712d0580, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66c25da53ca131dbdb292a8321d46178, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e4b127975c2aa2973f3e8008c00bcae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ef2530453eceba51732dc1b4d9e0caf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77d1244187365c54d02d88e8262b4de3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89b0d60014883020ae643a45c77afdde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fcf1becbc6f78db10937f18c38761d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91146fb9c9ea74312f2eb61a5b4ffce1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92550c4ea692aee09b8e63c75159cf2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/952bb3a2951b2250f9963cd6752c4f5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c9a7b2857de79e25c0de7095ba6d469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cb3dee0db6c41498b8c44d296cdf4a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e30991014d1e94550c3732c0139e8a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a182fb60b93d8904ca7ee8736736ae59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a30f01dabd33b23b221a586b935e6a4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acc6b0d00dce1ad85887d5dfa9d76616, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acea58c79e35c86be08eb22a38a8b867, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad4d512b29d3eebb0a63136a34943a38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3c1874eb8008245d6872a2451d6bc5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c673a43be57320cacf7eb4feb0d8ab8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccb04e5b65bf0e1562c5384229201b9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfc0a6b08c8f517942dc3c6d6e678b0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d17534bc9ad5044073bf95a13d2ee564, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1ddc32dd2b1d53b560d73d8f3204732, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db4951d3b219260d930f64591d81b0d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd477ef334d3c970a07d68dcece4d941, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2664e0597ff0594349358060045337d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e66e0939df1a017b55b647648f0d1021, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e684d13ee248f3f13e0f756043725d0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb852ae36d5ff471df6fc494ee97a0a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebbe647592243a983f5e030a393c3b27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f63765030c73c841f826b4910bda6e1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f83efd96466547ea2629aaeeddd10270, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff1938e2c8f5f6d5155c78951d0dbf3c"

These surface molecules associated with immune function were either induced (Class II) or upregulated (Class I and ICAM-1) on cultured retinal glial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant Interferonγ (rIFN-γ). MHC Class I and II expression by passaged and primary cells was maximal (> 90% positive) after incubation with 100 U/ml of rlFN-y for 48 h. ICAM-1 expression by primary and passaged cells tripled between 48 and 72 h after exposure to 25 or 50 U/ml of rIFN-γ. By 72 h after exposure to 100 U/ml of rIFN-y, 62% of the retinal glia were positive for ICAM-1, whereas under normal culture conditions these molecules were detected on < 3% of the retinal glia. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known stimulator of central nervous system (CMS) astrocytes, increased ICAM-1 expression only 3-fold to 9% of cells staining positively, but neither MHC Class I nor Class II expression was altered from baseline levels. Surface expression of ICAM-1, MHC Class I, and MHC Class II was unaffected by exposure to either rTNF-α (1000 U/ml) or rIL-6 (100 U/ml) for 24 h. Under normal culture conditions, intracellular interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected immunohistochemically. Exposure to either rIFN-γ or LPS induced more intense staining which correlated with increased secreted levels of both cytokines in culture supernatants. Levels of secreted TNF-α increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold. These results support the hypothesis that retinal glia may participate in intraretinal immune processes following stimulation during inflammatory and infectious processes via either cell surface- or soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms or a combination of both.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/045071d330196bfe4734af057c4d62fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fa93f70ec62d0791d9a6988fa0dfe28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1669381626318688bed5d903f065e8c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1941014f881f474f907e4df8088bdde7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb42facfa8adcfb4e7aa8491bfd6169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f2ae6f1863f0e1f87a1fa55c0cb2adf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/205a5aad632cc87ef168f7204ed97864, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21a401372722ea7b26e95cf2681af8a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/269502c2a86fb9294bd2051a821a40fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28d2c5c7d9cfad695a05099ec8a875ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b143a6d91e14a5a04dd2852da7719bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/424100d45837c5566471092653cb4a76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b92a1ef09a8df6c75d417da08a841e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d3a00046bec877e53c589148c36df93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f870c9c28432fab852e278b78d199a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62eb25c9b92bd7a42165f05a65d342ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d920f789180a57c649e6977828a47b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79a84722589ccdf7697c7beafc791e61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79d47967852d10ae159883f7919d747c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e489ba2dc5edb2abc295e9a765185c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/835621864f3a13a76a77e4d7554aa7dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a3949b4e493256677b76c47113a549a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9514ddd8768d6cddb1175279ebfcd2af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ad34e29119b33cf7f58eed89a4c7ff3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d43372ec36bd52892d3d13b636ea558, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d538269d200249272e31ee84bfad44b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9f05d9ff57a996e7b5c5865b62329b4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a26e07efb818bb56ff21d47d82d71240, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6919a6bd569db8c19dbcd1fbff0158b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abd8ccc34ee31f8c5b9ee5cea013c80f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0720997ae97833011d4afa890c82a71, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c55fdab71695fa62aeb2d69074362caa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd49f651ed1bd01b324abfcf8f936350, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd74655fd1e1b6e9540f6aca68ee26bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd7bb6d258ee93573149db795d0b2e7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d286509560845e09b610d37413cc73b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d686c2d78422a0a2974955c97d66c330, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7340c0018a8c505c3ebac1609a45e62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e77fe798dd757dd6251e3026cb1fb25c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eafbd1846624f51a796f872f5d385611, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec1075f1f56001ce7ee818a11836e38e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee2c853ab2f8a828faaac6ddbd4a01c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2af2c9a5c29764216a11128994af389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f34bb2c700a1c174145fec040660544a"

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by assortative mixing patterns and reactive school closures which decrease mixing between children, or by children exhibiting lower susceptibility to infection, or by children having a lower propensity to show clinical symptoms. We formally test these hypotheses by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries, finding strong age dependence in the probability of developing clinical symptoms, rising from around 20% in under 10s to over 70% in older adults. We find that interventions aimed at halting transmission in children may have minimal effects on preventing cases depending on the relative transmissibility of subclinical infections. Our estimated age-specific clinical fraction has implications for the expected global burden of clinical cases because of demographic differences across settings. In younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/154009b0245fa27814a41401da00a318, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d82f496fd43581004cf0f94ddbc7bfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23db21b10685d5ca003eb4ee6501017f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1be55e74481d8b17a084426507d03ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2161ae55e04c6a6e438166d1bd63164, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bac118f0284e5b4382f9ca52059e28f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3fae77b0ac8dff2b73379c74539e189"

Environmental triggers that cause a breakdown of myelin-specific T cell tolerance are unknown. We found that CD8(+) myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell tolerance can be broken and autoimmunity induced by infection with a virus that does not express MBP cross-reactive epitopes and does not depend on bystander activation. Instead, the virus activated dual T cell receptor (TCR)-expressing T cells capable of recognizing both MBP and viral antigens. These results demonstrate the importance of dual TCR T cells in autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected individuals, as hypothesized in the etiology of MS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c730a24fa277ca5dfe03be1900a3ec7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1506d1ac617675371c286d1e3237f1d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1991126f1b18d243c83a4eac131fe04b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2488f55d54ea895c2a8769f869dbf42a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d4831e831a2d5c06b9bc68e386b8174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/341b79d26f6641655072ebe29ff735e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34f4ba312cd264c24eaac7c2731627da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/374aa8780c496238ba8f2465e6a54f31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1f28d1741ca3ab091314d38d92aa76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49ab94b403de77afe7e5b73df0497b72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61bd0f4191d319e8d2820e4a9c3b8a58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66b771b75fb4b94047f073aee89980f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73cc4a0d98426fa05132e7ddf02e9738, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75a86575f062d6f6d3bd1be9fcec343b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81d3b1cb632811c0f6de196da91ee477, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8624063f9b0f4469a48c3770fe759481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93b1e5b8cafbcdf0d2a66aeca8e13c7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cab7d2e33ab04df596064462519f431, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a90b9857d1c83587b60eb64441936de7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9a54491c6edd33da478abe3c181c9ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c34c2ae01c1dcbee1b3f09888fe5419b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3c4e574d0e2d16d7830956e579d0a6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1a8eb4bce957b73e7853705859a7775, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc968bd550c43f9c93e4caa728bba457"

In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span. METHODS: Here we collected 361 peri-centenarian individuals (age ≥94 for female and age ≥90 for male) and 342 geographically matched controls (age 22-53, mean 35.0 ± 12.0) from Han Chinese. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was determined by PCR and genotype was called by separating the PCR products in agarose gel. RESULTS: A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that there was absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population. But the question of whether the DC-SIGNR could affect longevity in a gender-specific pattern remains open.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0405a54488826504e79a7e12277eb886, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/322e83eb95351212981fa6591288dd66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a52702792ff3a45088743877e5b594, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bfa4fcbfeeb930ff4dc56bf3ec2eb6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bea5285b06ed57418b69bb7cb710001, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/879e7b4b57f093ad73c987b820b5f01b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e838092dcdf855673501e30d4eaed37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97d1dc025e4a6460a1743740082c12ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d8d645cedddec09b03f2197b98f0d97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeb6ab691d5d1dee8af87c5f4f7303ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b554e6d0446e06454f8c6b7556d897f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd2c3b1c382cf9d3b07e40d58269b583, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3af1760d5de2a93da2fea84b530323f"

Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/018cc50422862d16d0d2ae8869327fa4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06d3e7c01a02f0e7a4883a9c2d4bec32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0aacbda0527c13c4c8f0c282736a54ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13fdac6404894c2829c9d4c4fcb767a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b68556b653672e281c2736c804b00c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30127a6c7257beaa8d8711a5e27b3e51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/35e8a0227ba4c1978c61fa2f93149a2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d00ed3831ed6a64e8c350c557a85f51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51b16a22b1cb64af9eacab4a7a110809, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/562e3cae7582eb6a671981c2cab0c341, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e64ee5beec878b7266300a01863e475, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6725e4c4d3eb124839c387099cf5a1a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ae703b5e85c73c023e96c8b0e6a6d5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/801e6d2338c30c0523e94f088b58858b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90447c6978f0907860e316a036051db0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/904b42309ca0eda70d4f79c4e86595e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94e54f1b3c5ad08b8fc54557717fd7fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b99c466d0570896299433cd1769aa826, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf3aa3805819b01d8ffa7e8745dff691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5dbcd23be05b78dbe7919aab7c4f560, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed1cbdbb6e61bfe7f313f51608d7240f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edc87f3b43534d3d429a9a319af6f60c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe16aa1b007d5be55a5a9236621eb33c"

RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β2 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30–39 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-β1 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-β2 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-β1/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: High serum CRP and low serum TGF-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease. Our results support the hypothesis of an immune-mediated pathogenesis in hantavirus infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/013df56e7b708138ad07d54ba694d28c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/058b30befe6dcae4882f8a351c367ca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b39c50e54d6561b0b2e2185ab0a9ec8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bdbc391d3f4914f4fc8487557aabb19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1898567382ebd6e8d2851a2cfc379721, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18bf903ee8ccbe034305dd41b2ccc18c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/192735675ef8dd27a099845d39e7210b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bf58089d7fc18a27147ccf2f7f4455a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e61353820b5039168a146b21dd0fba9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/299b1fd09a7051695e73f101766fd97f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b575165a9c92d15a235843d5be0c8aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ecb1afb3649d641abaf3bd8f962d8ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31db8eef70ca9e09cd6c690218526de2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/381d7286af92fb87cfb8aec017e9ead7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1e8e2f6ae937abaeea6047450c15f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/414c1fef95e7be1f9d5074270e7e4dc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43e7c20bd65b85a2a8385d891b122fcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/472c2a8dcb2456687546b9af1a82a6cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/472d3e7d4ddcc89194739f7300050491, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5d33bcd2df3a30dba7e603f2a7378d3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f650aecdcb124afa6198ae8f1aef1e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/637b9d368b4d0fcf3c95dd17882064af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/672e38ad0eced72d298e16e14d59d058, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/704b22235021abf159e1198726f7dbe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/744a5a8a8f5ab94164e22000f296d8f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76e7613b76047dbfa06b1a4ec4161a04, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ce039898a2d60c732b8e06422b6ffa5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9024de98d6760f391d7aca1e08d1b216, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/926b77fa3d1bcacd789bc4dea401d9fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/931777541af10dd0e3eae0e97185616d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a440e51e09178e8de66330b77369d4ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a864f99d6ed6a62e2f041d59994dc63d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9fa9a723f08297da445ec6ff9336f47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b308f8d070a67af905d57fd0d5e5873c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8271f54e44ca6216e48df49bfde6422, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9b77df267312e41012452c4dec31a21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4e51b6a4fef79f801ab2525600d29fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5584c8bb2145b7fcead1f2bb0f58ad0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7f9e5730cde53b5d43913205993fcc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c817480e0e7c9891274fb26364a35429, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db153526da08ed972499082758445ca6"

Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are the first cells that influenza virus encounters upon entering the alveolus. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, which in turn induce damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are well known to regulate repair of damaged alveolar epithelium by stimulating cell migration and proliferation. Recently, TGF-α/EGFR signaling has also been shown to regulate innate immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells. However, little is known about whether HGF/c-Met signaling alters the innate immune responses and whether the innate immune responses in AECs are regulated by HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR. We hypothesized that HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR would regulate innate immune responses to influenza A virus infection in human AECs. We found that recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) and rhTGF-α stimulated primary human AECs to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly and IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 moderately. Influenza infection stimulated the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF by AECs plated on rat-tail collagen through EGFR activation likely by TGF-α released from AECs and through c-Met activated by HGF secreted from lung fibroblasts. HGF secretion by fibroblasts was stimulated by AEC production of prostaglandin E(2) during influenza infection. We conclude that HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR signaling enhances the innate immune responses by human AECs during influenza infections.",""

Although several vaccines against these viruses are commercially available there is room for improvement, especially in the case of PRRSV. The ability of arteriviruses to counteract the immune response is thought to decrease the efficacy of the current modified live virus vaccines. We have recently shown that the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of EAV papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) is important for the inhibition of innate immune activation during infection. A vaccine virus lacking PLP2 DUB activity may therefore be more immunogenic and provide improved protection against subsequent challenge than its DUB-competent counterpart. To test this hypothesis, twenty Shetland mares were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Two groups were vaccinated, either with DUB-positive (n =9) or DUB-negative (n =9) recombinant EAV. The third group (n =2) was not vaccinated. All horses were subsequently challenged with the virulent KY84 strain of EAV. Both vaccine viruses proved to be replication competent in vivo. In addition, the DUB-negative virus provided a similar degree of protection against clinical disease as its DUB-positive parental counterpart. Owing to the already high level of protection provided by the parental virus, a possible improvement due to inactivation of PLP2 DUB activity could not be detected under these experimental conditions. Taken together, the data obtained in this study warrant further in vivo investigations into the potential of using DUB-mutant viruses for the improvement of arterivirus vaccines.",""

Lymphopenia along with neutrophilia was a feature of SARS, as it is in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Ebola infections, to name a few. Direct infestation of lymphocytes, neutrophils and macrophages by SARS coronavirus (CoV) has been debated as a cause of lymphopenia, but there is no convincing data. Lymphopenia can be caused by glucocorticoids, and thus any debilitating condition has the potential to induce lymphopenia via stress mechanism involving the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Cortisol levels are elevated in patients with RSV and Ebola, and cortisol was higher in SARS patients with lymphopenia before any steroid therapy. Glucocorticoids also down-regulate the production of proinflammatory lymphokines. Because of the insidious presentation, SARS was treated with antibacterial, antiviral and supra-physiological doses of glucocorticoids. Treatment with glucocorticoids complicated the issue regarding lymphopenia, and certainly calls into question the status of lymphokines and their prognostic implications in SARS.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ff8334adc253bfdec22e75a57b17a44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/162200618b5d55b6f4ec6b6b5b71d16a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16b35eac96a29cef18d40182ee01373b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23348b39cd31420a67fb124a8da38567, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24bf8ace883732472b1c56ed72ad40c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/252331e3a5be5a484f5fefff172df7c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b95031226dc7323a67570364160cee9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32a0f89683d8bcbc4e2caac4b10f8192, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33f9d898cba3ea44896a5f0f139f2e0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b55c98710d8a0ecabbc81053a2ab2b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f1ff5b294785356491e9e601711f9b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44f48fa3438403691852862a53c72574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5947e173f4377c9f4506b0ea8e4d8a97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b049005cc4f00222af119af2f0c02d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/615511c7f3588ddeed4536add5c4eb30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/641f8358f99520f957158d7e43abb0d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7751d6be32087f885cd93e109cbeafc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bf1ef459c6e12804a52a8767267c3cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e69543fbfe4d21ead1e3ca7e6b008ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85ad0088a053440c2b61e9bc305d4c80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87a24462cedd93869d28c3b0f1ba2ebf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bd12067cf8bd394ed5244a6a76dc163, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c091250a516efe32e8b8e9115303b52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ec48d5de2e8de94941e9ccbe0d483ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ed22b6d7a5b90522d242964a606a011, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98997254a0d45f0ee34ac1a025efe988, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ad5a7b95e07b9f78f8842abe215791b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1e169d34863c1a81eb7074690b154ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a60c39056fad5e9a69c5f0b36e19942f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aac5132350d0a962bfa44ee21ad9623c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad7a94d6fe2fbf8c2e094cb5d41a419a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d20eac4793ff245ad705edcfa3532df6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc4e8decfcb97af7da6ebcf2d59142ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed9dff9537857b4f83af9cd15d33a8d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0fc33c396dcf2fcf8f7953c7c832aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f61c7db87e64c481ab36e64d3159f321, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f65d3649a630de95289d621b409ad184, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f69fb10886ac4e823c45cc9279b41767"

On this basis, we hypothesized that ACE-2 would be protective against experimental lung fibrogenesis and might be downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. In lung biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, ACE-2 mRNA and enzyme activity were decreased by 92% (P < 0.01) and 74% (P < 0.05), respectively. ACE-2 mRNA and activity were also decreased similarly in the lungs of bleomycin-treated rats and C57-BL6 mice. In mice exposed to low doses of bleomycin, lung collagen accumulation was enhanced by intratracheal administration of either ACE-2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or the peptide DX(600), a competitive inhibitor of ACE-2 (P < 0.05). Administration of either ACE-2 siRNA or DX(600) significantly increased the ANG II content of mouse lung tissue above the level induced by bleomycin alone. Coadministration of the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin blocked the DX(600)-induced increase in lung collagen. Moreover, purified recombinant human ACE-2, delivered to mice systemically by osmotic minipump, attenuated bleomycin-induced lung collagen accumulation. Together, these data show that ACE-2 mRNA and activity are severely downregulated in both human and experimental lung fibrosis and suggest that ACE-2 protects against lung fibrogenesis by limiting the local accumulation of the profibrotic peptide ANG II.",""

We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. Methods Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. Results Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p = 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. Conclusion Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH.

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.MethodsWe estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines.FindingsWe estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5·2 and 7·1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%.InterpretationDose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.FundingNIH-MIDAS, HMRF-Hong Kong",""

Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named ‘hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients. We show that these T-UCRs are predominantly nuclear and that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is at least partly responsible for the induction of several members of this group. One specific HINCUT, uc.475 (or HINCUT-1) is part of a retained intron of the host protein-coding gene, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, which is overexpressed in epithelial cancer types. Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation, HINCUT-1 supports cell proliferation specifically under hypoxic conditions and may be critical for optimal O-GlcNAcylation of proteins when oxygen tension is limiting. Our data gives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising protein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category.",""

The treatment through the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon is expensive, only mildly effective, and is associated with severe side effects. In 2011, two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, boceprevir and telaprevir, were licensed that have shown enhanced sustained virologic response (SVR) in phase III clinical trial, however, these interferon-free treatments are more sensitive to HCV genotype 1 infection. The variable nature of HCV, and the limited number of inhibitors developed thus aim in expanding the repertoire of available drug targets, resulting in targeting the virus assembly therapeutically. AIM: We conducted this study to predict the 3D structure of the p7 protein from the HCV genotypes 3 and 4. Approximately 63 amino acid residues encoded in HCV render this channel sensitive to inhibitors, making p7 a promising target for novel therapies. HCV p7 protein forms a small membrane known as viroporin, and is essential for effective self-assembly of large channels that conduct cation assembly and discharge infectious virion particles. METHOD: In this study, we screened drugs and flavonoids known to disrupt translation and production of HCV proteins, targeted against the active site of p7 residues of HCV genotype 3 (GT3) (isolatek3a) and HCV genotype 4a (GT4) (isolateED43). Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative structure–activity relationship and docking interaction study. RESULTS: The drug NB-DNJ formed the highest number of hydrogen bond interactions with both modeled p7 proteins with high interaction energy, followed by BIT225. A flavonoid screen demonstrated that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), nobiletin, and quercetin, have more binding modes in GT3 than in GT4. Thus, the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential. This structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds, confirming p7 as a new target in the rapidly increasing era of HCV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a8e5445a6603e4c8384bbfffb3d2ea2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c98ad256f6083626ec0b4a6dddd538d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/210355898b2c3f76f2179c000c7abaca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b6d65a1fd197ec4b419657e1322d2c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c3227beecc416901c83cf5cdb1cea90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e1c1c35c68522480e339a3065551864, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5760890db78daca58de73efd47d65d59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63ccc897940b125cb5774068bfda58dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/785902693acda3e912e9923bd5f57f35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/791fe3ca5ca2900a3e90898ffbbdc2fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/797f67d58f26d360ee73e8043af1b15f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cbe1affee5d9eea444d965c5eb3e2f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9927371962e83415b319aa808886b9ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2611d2ad1738deb335882f93a21a88b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a625757dc9fed4216d87e2c03bb8dfcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a763454e927045b9fcd090c3576c38e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abba6a78964d148a53c11ca9a00bb449, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8209338e5e26d27194cd1556192c61d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d083ea4352770cc3c4909b930cab299f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1201d11f1849b44660f06566604f4dd"

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, irreversible and debilitating lung disease showing fibroblast/myofibroblast expansion and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the interstitium leading to breathing difficulty. Our previous observation revealed a partial relief of lung fibrosis in patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We hypothesize that Cordyceps has beneficial effects on lung fibrosis and the objective of this study is to explore the target(s) of Cordyceps in the relief of lung fibrosis in animal and cell models and to gain insight into its underlying mechanisms. Material and methods A rat model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis and a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction were employed in the studies. Results Reduction of infiltration of inflammatory cells, deposition of fibroblastic loci and collagen, formation of reactive oxygen species, and production of cytokines, as well as recovery from imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1, were observed in fibrotic rats after treatment with Cordyceps in preventive (from the day of BLM administration) and therapeutic (from 14 days after BLM) regimens. In a fibrotic cell model with transforming growth factor beta-1 induction, the human lung epithelial A549 acquired a mesenchymal phenotype and an increase of vimentin expression with a concomitant decrease of E-cadherin. This epithelial–mesenchymal transition could be partially reverted by cordycepin, a major component of Cordyceps.

Samols, and I. Kushner. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:4169-4173). In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent- dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium binding studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (Kd = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c336dafd179b454f28ef66c523d8668, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1306427f75de88d5e9883680b67c68a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1427124f40a8802c808960473dd2982c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/166fa8529817f8841787e1b070f93121, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a1e6b7e7787ff8e84ed66105d5f8f16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f84d27b1259b4ed16048ff53ff76a09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2224d771f72d3e73e60b92c769dd4df8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/330fedea9d91c4ad77231b788e098df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/379a01bb947183ccdf696e835f1f57fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c2e00b1f04e37f2ed666858b78a5c1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/406854124b6433f54d384c179bad4310, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f2a38c68b002d0d59c143ce501b11d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fb6e43307f5fefc68d5e455d2607f19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53d77963b5d2a2bf98cd84b952cd2d19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55e8300610e7786bf4c6f0aff99973c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5671c9220fd2790f32dbb75104de1212, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c316c8693e4049c1e84bdbb1d149f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ed867ffbdc522d9410dca7ba76476bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/666ead84bc57c1c9c89addce6f908336, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66f95f56b59361446ccd43e475f080c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/759f635e39623af06db5cf3fee76a7a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e4e01158f816bed32539b5f0ecbf20e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87203af9906dab8005906388caf0b644, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/903aa5a89d53cddaeff9374e1b2f94e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/919272c878f7966077919f8e007791b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91d64022ab338ec45c58a4dcb61f883b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94a255ae93c93751c8d82a1102108533, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/978a4b9716b11a0fc96681ec8122092d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d28472dc7cd5360843ecbb3bc68dda7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aff37ace936f9d9d2e9829862b509a32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7af324995009588041b0d41308130b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbc4b047ab040a23df27c2192a1ac408, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d280985a6099f587999f228e96413e08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0c075ba961e1f0d85d3d3827670b3d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e25160fa1b91f6b398457a98b8dbc166, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e47c64d57611439ab742ba8c9bdd858f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e480c53114e4ca89a39e641bf107c2a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f02ec944e5e9ff7cdc13cf7985813b5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6e16df2664e4daed43143aae44a9541"

The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial, the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells, evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens, suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells, a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts, and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life. The aim of this chapter is to review the viral evolution and the insects as host.",""

The organism and its toxins (TcdA and TcdB), respectively, were found in 25.3% and 22.9% of stool samples from diarrheic calves. Culture positive samples were more likely than culture negative samples to be toxin positive. However, toxin positive stools were more common among nondiarrheic calves, but diarrheic calves were nearly twice as likely to be culture positive. Ribotype 078 was dominant among isolates. Salmonella sp. was isolated from both diarrheic and nondiarrheic calves, but large numbers of E. coli were found more commonly in diarrheic calves than in nondiarrheic animals. Prevalence rates for coronavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. were substantially higher in nondiarrheic calves than in diarrheic, but rates of detection of rotavirus and Giardia sp. were more nearly equal between groups. Lesions in naturally infected calves included superficial mucosal erosion with associated fibrinous exudates. Neutrophils and eosinophils infiltrated lamina propria. Large Gram-positive rods morphologically compatible with C. difficile were abundant in the colonic lumen and the organism was isolated by bacteriologic culture. Toxins were found throughout the colon. Purified toxins A and B (individually and conjointly) caused comparable lesions, as well as fluid accumulation, in ligated intestinal loops. Our findings are in substantial agreement with those of others [Rodriguez-Palacios, A., Stampfli, H.R., Duffield, T., Peregrine, A.S., Trotz-Williams, L.A., Arroyo, L.G., Brazier, J.S., Weese, J.S., 2006.

It seems clear that calves serve as multiplying hosts for this organism.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19271a68c2ab808da5ecfb291c9aa1a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bae921d3b9f24ec647f419285a10944, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e8f3d10336934baa6f058c29613ef59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43fc77ef97b6dcd8f84628bc6254e4f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4857d677fae4c5e4043010823e2a0dc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c864979b3b5ea226024b0d77838cfe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56d82c226738481fd1a4fcbd73ba9ace, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5776175e1d08bddb4dbef49199398225, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61e3d5afe8bc17d9b2308956428ce0a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c2e81c01be879ab84329c7fe436849d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d06094bbc3de73b41ab6c396bce05ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/796a1bbc95ae71ae16fe29f9c2e20c6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81c37d983481ba8ae00329db9e8dd878, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c54821510f26be07098ac0d39cc5b45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c9aa5d36f82803b6b040e24ddfd3ec3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cbd64b6bd06ac1fd2680b0d65c7ea88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/905e4f019c028a51ba605dbf82aa2468, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cd95a1d21fc0451ae9993b80a71e030, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e71c7c0d82a3d0ef7f0ee748472a6dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae00f23ca47ca425281c007daa4f814a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7082b83319679d4d35556a8111808b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfb655ecb02f702f4e4708c671e99e39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2716a6c2391c4b29b66e935dc0d55fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6cfa826ea467077fde00c01256255b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cce5fa3c22173e88ffb9868a15aea016, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfbb92e1cec0f64c7c97bed6df5740dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec1d7c40c7b6da9171a01c64f20fe34a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f34cac0ef62db08cd8421767e97cb5bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc78dbbdef15941f0937c8662b93ea30"

Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5′ to 3′ folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/033b37e95a449286a1b8f3a0ff7b90d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03bbaca07e4ecaff689cc911f7780917, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10418109857ca99a7b9d2dbd0aa22bff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14f61850f50855c512bab3ae1ec370bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29091512f65493ec0834ca70cb93fe12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/361436cf3efca485a0b1c1f036b95ffb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/490d43d82b0ecf8fafdfa14d99b0ee50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cf3ea0718f74f850957f0eca959a8d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f5056c971c2063f785b7d5aea0a0c82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/672a2e54d482698856763e3d79fb60c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68efac4ba00c07a55db6854191802b3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fbcbd6f9702637be1e04436c887ead4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92ce5bbc93bf2f24319127bc0f6c8e2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9c8e8844e280ac19e3c5c4443326733, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d31289d0914c37922b66b4da8adf7f78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f620f4ab8839570df5552d3f7a78527b"

The part-worth values for the trip product elements are expected to depend on a number of traveler characteristics. The predictors hypothesized are city travel experience, general modal preference, socio-economic status, and car ownership. In the survey, the combinations of trip attributes differed between the two subgroups of leisure and business travelers. The leisure travelers rated three levels of mode, length of stay, and price, but only one level of the hotel category. The business travelers were shown four mode alternatives and only two levels for each of the other trip product elements. The conjoint measurements were elaborated by fitting an Extended Bradley–Terry Model. Demonstrating the application of the EBTM is the main purpose of the paper. The EBTM offers several advantages over the more popular versions of conjoint analysis. It correctly treats ties and allows for simultaneous estimation of the trip package (‘object’) parameters, object covariates (trip attributes), subject covariates (traveler characteristics) and their interactions. For both the business and the leisure travelers, the mode of transport dominated the assessment of a city trip package. For leisure tourists, e.g., switching from train 2nd class to an economy flight boosted the trip package more than twice as much as replacing train for bus. A variation of the package price was much more important for the leisure than for the business travelers. The socio-economic status proved to be an important factor and was particularly influential among the business travelers. In the leisure tourists' sub-sample age was not only important for valuing the mode of transport, but had a preferential impact for all trip components. Finally, the limitations of this demonstration study that discourage extrapolation to city travelers in general are emphasized.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bf282117772f2721173e1732efb5ff8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15095d46844cfcbdd1dd9dc106e72433, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9649e4caec0ab3888baf95a430afcaf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1aad675e39a6a7a3b4ed3b344f925f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc4b508fbf3278f1755d3fec6c262a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d55e7ee523efaa3fb8f4ae1afe96dbba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0681478e6c9927eca719dea1298e5ea"

Evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning, whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations. These limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles. Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection. Depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment. Moreover, data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia, reduced bodily iron stores, conservation/withdrawal behavior, hypervigilance and anorexia. By shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world, the Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm, whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01787468035f5da1421ce47f8d399481, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d3eeed484aad3a33da8d5a803d993b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/139adfd6d94ca43a4a5f0b27e91f5cf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17cafdfebcd13ce4713e50574670da9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19834d536a91b9f5e77451953af51a6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d865859134b6ef0b8beeafc0e1c7a49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29cee262822398e209fdd3d46a44bb86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29df8f78b176357b042569dd7be1ac32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d03ff735f895c4f6f31f2d40ac7f4c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45575191189fcd4abb348d9a7e4db389, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49add0fb745b7281e654c52ceeb715a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d9e49bad7c174ca8361aaeefc4abebf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f8fad58876e562c033ceaa3a4947e95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6752de6da467ad3bb2892410e32f39b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6864b1703ebd111ad79df9cbc48e370c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c436e3e71382f550a2cf00946f9dd8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c50db66d11e0c1b66a9a03a70895a0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dac70d7808e3ab320f9670f4a8ca786, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7764eca0295c5f3ff7f5b6411058b67c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79d09aa2f7f4d128e2ed354858028207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79e41e8d58cb32ecb0cb7fe206c88aad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a86894793b0268c7c59f38e4e3fce94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7af3eb6ca99cb650e5665699774b60d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cdf8adbb268f21a2c290722ea159dfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/839a8b2b133d3cc9cd18304304f9ba5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87b30fdcf6766e0ff97891dad3238994, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b5025f528aaab39662b3dfc552012fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d8065a9d494cc255ea833cef6367a32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/960e85446b791a72b435a0efa228c8db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d8f7decf7b31f7d56bac97d14a585ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a876f1af15f9b2abb7fde76143e16ac4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b01ebf7008f7e57cdd7c446359d558df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b111fb47984678d49d0adbd0e87bb982, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7496268cccf2248e01e57e52ece87d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd35c47cb78c2b695f5cb735aac2f347, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0b947604a8fc653c56ed27854480892, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c285dabcd38c066682c2470c593e0358, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd422b0820c6c0c0754f912b8da3d9ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce860f0b4dac4e74963778574b2a6703, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2e2a8eeed056846c61b1bfb619b1cc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3b4128384b62e04f6f4f91c47aa4323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d80a5d8a4f449692d4f3b7b39a093718, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d92dfa51d238a299488d24a6c47652a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db55df903b18a3af7d46e94536995b66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0655f4dcc898b0ac863739c93be38a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5a5b7bbd0c2052e0ed2c28f71644a8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e901d6763fb38ce6da690d312afd03a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecb3bed06a71e82c31abc0791c476f5b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f582fc1a790408e124830448b862fbf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f97996b4c628e78a64e38c33c660e0bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd7b3c0322d16d3c1f55abfbf96461d2"

Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. RESULTS: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor. Putative factors may be geographic variations in specific virus strains and rate of vaccination. Knowledge of these factors and the geographical distributions of these infections can inform recommendations for testing, management and prevention. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association of these factors with FIV and FeLV.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04c4006df01a5bf5d07fca58489e698b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/189b9d5a3ac095d287bae0a9ef7369b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19938c6e94cc315e4c790f12da974e4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ec8caedb9cd29ae4a7c68349dca6b11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2459afc698658e5a717b1ada254902d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26a5938087bbacfc766e835688575bf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2782a5c084dfdeaf80c047da66d7ba49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/285e9728f568ada22921335ef6e0e7ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34737ef5f10f7a1837f22550602c639d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34c9c8d745d9757d2960ee4cc31b1309, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/405224fb6e3550566254fb504ca600e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5200b1b57bf51fe3ba761fcf77198a84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ae02d51e4a34c6ea65b485e0ee1152c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65cc0e059109543632f8e4d66104b27b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6695c5e8a084a64ad26fbcf12f11cb6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a1c86eb49411fa53653b06973a5dd5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b0348283bf2a8b89f6c0c72c3cca4c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73d4ba20eb389c58368642fffb84693c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/926c313e9df87d3c532d38740d3310cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95ae54a6b8435864331fa2c52fc07f1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c1fea19d994e7398307d4ef714e49f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9db04820c8de3f3013b285f8346b7012, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a05efacfab47f9ac3a4454a97d81f88c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6b146e3ed14723def24cbd66b586a5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a808c8c5c5706bac990ee13f1bd1115a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abf6380835d67fb247f94d40f7ee3e54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aea8ea865abdfff5c2fa10a988e1ff3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c12c00b4b9e75408112158870c84b5fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c32351226b1605673aa22b0adfc339ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3bfa29dd1334328597cab45c7af30cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d113e8db6f4f47de29da188b7697e190, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d173c2524c8cc5fb6277c6674de4d26b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2d9cdd6385e1d655a8afa1c63797771, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d636a5c03ca7866e5a46268f78176ae3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db0466a4d8c5625521623a530a193853, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e144bb64a6210a15ee862dcc8a042bc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f401487fa88696fb7d9306805a157cc9"

Often no pathogen is detected and it is unclear whether this is because pathogens are absent in some patients or the investigations used fail to detect them. The hypothesis that AIDS related diarrhoea is usually due to an infection, which can be identified by a simple diagnostic strategy based on the results of intensive investigation of a cohort of such patients, was investigated. METHODS: 155 patients with AIDS and chronic diarrhoea underwent contemporaneous examination of stools, duodenal, jejunal, and rectal biopsy specimens and duodenal aspirate for bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens. A decision tree analysis was used to determine the best sequential diagnostic strategy for clinicians. RESULTS: 128 of 155 patients investigated (83%) had at least one potential pathogen. The presenting clinical features could not predict the presence or site of the pathogens. Stool analysis identified the most pathogens (93 of 199, 47%). Rectal biopsy was essential for the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and adenovirus. Duodenal biopsy was as helpful as jejunal biopsy and detected some treatable pathogens missed by other methods. Electron microscopy, impression smears, and duodenal aspirate yielded little extra information. If gut biopsy was reserved for patients without a stool pathogen, some treatable pathogens would have been missed. CONCLUSION: Most patients with AIDS and chronic diarrhoea have at least one gut pathogen, which can be identified by stool analysis and light microscopic examination of duodenal and rectal biopsies. Some pathogens will be missed unless all these investigations are done on all such patients.",""

We examined the pathogenic effects of the viruses in chicken embryos and the size and morphology of the virus particles, performed phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene and complete genomic sequences, and examined the antibody responses against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The results suggested that the viruses I0623/17 and I0710/17 were avian coronaviruses and were identified as pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), with greatest similarity to IBV. Further investigations of the antigenicity, complete genome organization, substitutions in multiple genes, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants showed obvious differences between PhCoV and IBV in terms of antigenicity, and viral pathogenicity, replication, and shedding in chickens and pheasants. The close genetic relationship, but obvious differences between PhCoVs and IBVs suggested the IBVs could be the ancestors of PhCoVs, and that PhCoVs isolated from different outbreaks may have evolved independently from IBVs circulating in the specific region by adaption in pheasants. This hypothesis was supported by analysis of the S1 gene fragments of the two PhCoVs isolated in the current study, as well as PhCoVs isolated in the UK and selected IBV strains. Such analyses indicated different evolution patterns and different tissue tropisms between PhCoVs isolated in different outbreaks. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis by studying the complete genomic sequences of PhCoVs from different outbreaks and the pathogenicity of IBVs in pheasants to compare and clarify the relationships between PhCoVs and IBVs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/088e3613b5fffe9e9521ca835fc1dfd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f1c19c60d0341daaa9ab70e66164920, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/163c8c983afcc480949544adcd0a9e00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2661c2c75e2d1c5b8338d316c872ff5c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29c98ec8f84ab6c91b20adc0368517aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cdcfeeab4e421edfc8c5dc7b87c6896, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ce8e64a5ff1c826347778ead3e2ba45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/341bf810f49509e1426f770c21413327, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3716b42ab1b02edc1f239727798e88bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c675653c646a15e15f09fa180b44c2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/425e31c91ca12e08b715909c1a66935f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52ac4387a5b31eea9787824698a7e5f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/538f6e216ee9bc604236198107138f3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b8eec777b4912b1e14290b00542b4ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61a4ab39ea125a7037cf6d289175dd70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/671de432b7167dbffd85547108fbbbd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7760b0cca98d2356fa28a1e63b2ce69d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8861e06c24134bbd736685dc374ccfe5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bc4ca251d12a164ef1bb54b2ad2dde7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8da8581afc3519ef6eef70438fd7d85a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f82c6d893ad863626b33fb85bc9bb61, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93d41bded8cf7aed7c0cec397f52b01d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/988e3182e798b4a90400a7f72e82c2af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9cce75eadc901bfe278f07d1c8e347b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad160bc7276654bdd7aac90ca614f953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af673baeabf9fb7fde943fe158529644, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b072320a0d3ef11ee2897432c669aef0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6b0b17ae5f767280727ae7a87ee2504, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0891bab92b0567742a15830ae32d8ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1e6fc700d7e0bee3f6a58d70000b86e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9a3f0914f57c5b5e3a5098f3dc4b953, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2455c3786d29f78eb046948a1121c2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f095af98315297c9232ccfab7455f6bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f35421574e4f62d584d1dd7f0d6465d7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f7c4a4ec1a8b0d38d7132dbcd1593e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5ba33017502eab22e4b91a74cf62db1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb9f0d0524aec055be83b05d88f78180"

Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinant FMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A(24) Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers were further compared to 2 naïve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers. Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response–such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells–were significantly overrepresented. Differential gene expression was significantly correlated between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (biological correlation +0.97), indicating a similar transcriptome profile across these groups. Genes related to prostaglandin E(2) production and the induction of regulatory T cells were overexpressed in carriers. In contrast, tissues from non-carrier animals expressed higher levels of complement regulators and pro-apoptotic genes that could promote virus clearance. Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis for FMDV persistence in nasopharyngeal tissues of cattle, in which the virus may be maintained by an impairment of apoptosis and the local suppression of cell-mediated antiviral immunity by inducible regulatory T cells.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06962369c330583f511e8181d86ae8e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1451f466d9108db4b927f3e6b8fad7c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b7f54f683a8bea17ec925ba9c470771, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a4c872ac79576b3fa1b8c6a3e23c854, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b71fac1f8b38ca666a2edeec2182340, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3de2c91fc8e6371e5e21b41b7bcef37e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/432b53fd3d000d05891dfca6b7c23229, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b044e7b36f1c1db1a1d7cb4c2e3054f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f4ce9741038bb98211fcb83c364cf9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61487e43090f26d9db7caac2bd14f5c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61bff22454828abba5c3cb8cb1775b45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67c9149e18f7566147a4cad2c8e08e4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bf4860485b72c92b34e0700fc14666a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ea31f6651cda1a6232d050f3feb90c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71d94de0b4826bc0df82f8e8863910ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/746b087b20c3c35fd1ec93f3ac3544b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7eaea91535945efee7eb35cd47648a12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86c5e7daa6460a045181ac0022dda43e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a2f3ee2d9d285580ea347867a7149b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8eadf2f8672a5c802a6444160401e0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa1f506fedf768b0d2c5070d157d69b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3fc55323a1b693115cf14f43e4f20d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b737670f0b94eab087eefa63c4b93e5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1e33d765eb255f800da20a0880ce41f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9c2498bb929e4828fef56c6c7debbda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccd779a168ad2661f7b83eec18f2f90c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce8ce1e4826ec1a46ee56f430074cfec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d19c3cd4c1063174ae07c9203217a04f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6c9f2a8c6a18d4f730dd88aa161655c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7d1d6d6c642d1ff1b24c2a1a2f26b21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3ee18e78ed3e45a7ea2acbac8110012, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4de1f45096023a23e73d7f2bbe0876c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7980658aa5e7243ea38301671e0fc1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea7d6a56c7c450eca815b7b9e0097d0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebd95163baa5f47c46f32b04d7cf6ce9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8db5e88bd8fc1fb9b0c103a68144ff7"

Previous studies demonstrate that SM is acquired by a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway, although paradoxically, this pathway is dispensable for bacterial replication. This finding suggests that other lipid transport mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of host SM. In this work, we interrogated the role of specific components of BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways to define their contribution in SM acquisition during infection. We found that C. trachomatis hijacks components of both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways for SM acquisition but that the SM obtained from these separate pathways is being utilized by the pathogen in different ways. We show that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts only one of the three known BFA targets, GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. The Arf1/GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition is essential for inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not required for bacterial replication. In contrast, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts CERT, a lipid transfer protein that is a key component in non-vesicular ER to trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (the precursor for SM), for C. trachomatis replication. We demonstrate that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner, VAP-A, and SM synthases, SMS1 and SMS2, to the inclusion and propose that these proteins establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion. We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen redirects SM biosynthesis to its replicative niche.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0be50f890b2c2e6769a02c5529ee355a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0dcc016f23e5cbe9b733b5074264a47a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14c30b896bfba3fe71576f6ab132b596, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bdfa6481385fca9f8eeb2d891c47010, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27b20081b4cd458149f01cd9d8ca6ed7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ac67de5d273f318cd1bb3164dd7a5ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42df79dccd9e8d7e7f0fdaea1180287e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42fae128c4b32a9a63eed4ff12ba9b00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49f141095f4fc8d114bcd02ff3d822e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e1bd0474438788ff761d5d7716c1807, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5813c1cf9a9837f9639ea3aeb0ef1f54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5903336903b43c760bdb2863236a87a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dd67ad1dd21bda7f7bb2a4ea6df567d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6737bb0c6f529620cddb766aa2f7b7ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6af973ad9ccceaede0d90ebc4b8c7448, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ec12aeff2d60397c2d10ab8eeaac916, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7227f0257812fbc2d26ec2aca49ae055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77a3fc3d3d22c8e52113dbdbaa056870, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c8852a59a66a4e35853d0141e33823f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96b2dac69162b99eecec892cbfcf9275, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e097cab565d69e143d34bc7eddce469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a083b2789708830e1b9f3123777a7c72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a16b92acd01e3e47481af0c27a2f87b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5ef8df266c36369e9f1bf1b5b62bfb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a816642ad9f448e028756372f50a61b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acadb1ee2ba695f05c5b407fc5ac9443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5827008b17203251168c766acf57bc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c79db45c2d40173e197cb59a099ef376, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc2de3f87f926fc37a2cc9a1a50d7aff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf3cc19003ca194f8221b0aec66af9e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0ddd05482022737b4adb9f516033f2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/deeedda235f8d4a7f4dc7f06e56f171b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e15300e355310d6c6159227c3bcf1dd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8ed6700f60773a0c1efb3b90c49d72c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f563baadd509d37a6d35c64fe8a134fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f91a1a1d75ebe1683cdcc23b45ddac44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/face1442c1a81580579fa7c541987e85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd0e8b62a98b104138259034983b5f04"

To extend knowledge on the heterogeneous neurological outcomes caused by TMEV and identify new models of human neurological diseases associated with antecedent infections, we analyzed the phenotypic consequences of TMEV infection in the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population. We evaluated 5 different CC strains for outcomes of long-term infection (3 months) and acute vs. early chronic infection (7 vs. 28 days post-infection), using neurological and behavioral phenotyping tests and histology. We correlated phenotypic observations with haplotypes of genomic regions previously linked to TMEV susceptibility to test the hypothesis that genomic diversity within CC mice results in variable disease phenotypes in response to TMEV. None of the 5 strains analyzed had a response identical to that of any other CC strain or inbred strain for which prior data are available, indicating that strains of the CC can produce novel models of neurological disease. Thus, CC strains can be a powerful resource for studying how viral infection can cause different neurological outcomes depending on host genetic background.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01cd1e265f3bfdbce1cb76da2f82ffad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c89281d60e9db5b70a0a103beb3d7c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/142dc1099ea976e93c430298aa506c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18a3a6dffeb1424628bd84cbe6196be4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2024d672008743ed89328d78c4f7c254, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/242b3b4db667119cf182b12ee65cad9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2df2e9822f9d591389175c191415a5c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d8da734511497418fdb8085e330ad78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e868dab7fc6a23526ba6396a7b81b59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82cc1bc851a519d03129506d5a23565d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9480dd55c19b642cd5588960c738dca3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a6303a08b2aa209b4141372e4e5195d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3694d4ae29a5fde78f7f52046f0e184, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8bb0a56d67602e3deaae7ddcb67265e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5ce26eeee4dc0b068a08813326f8138, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5d18b61f4b3db3f76cb3b1aa5a22e7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6e3d7ce6b0f580381de0062c7096b64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c76f4365b0da126ca67c7cf221a76a23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7abcc8dad26137455e70d276d24665d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8e9c6e841e2087c446caad5619c6777, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d28dda8189d58477d7d86f03f96125ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d596c74dda10654f8d303476fc1ada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f186e77ec4ad522a32168364cff8189a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f304e0651adea536717814cb30de86f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6d19140a302cef94907226ea9d956d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8796e6704e61fbb8f8214dd00d7662f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8cfe31f60cc04648c6a8b4884ca1691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f93391831e92a73835e39aabd1953e66"

Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information. RESULTS: We present a new method, Iterative HFold, for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction. Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of IPknot, and with about 35% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of HotKnots V2.0 while being significantly faster.

The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 °C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 °C (3.7 min), 80 °C (2.4 min), and 90 °C (2.3 min) compared with 60 °C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 °C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0485068d3e6d59516aea822f0c595eba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/167ce4de8d37d2414c0b33f44f9cdb4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b06f3c5ca67f7c25ba7ad6b4aae06dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e3419b65b535d0a4a485a08e3f45ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2915f7e1a312d580f21311cdc03120bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e6a22e695ad9c9accd77dc198a4ca87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e2ad30dfdb014529cfea480ab4bca9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47a48fb2020b7faa9ac768a8d0e85280, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d008ec4717e02af22cb58e3534448af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f9d49954217aef329097a2044247538, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/513d8894d85dde5228fbd2ba354d09eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e6f01e8e45b99569da446444ede82ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61e953f7713169f2488c321ce6fdae70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/674656728c4caf421789580c19e8389d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b4cac2a0d60dde197515bffe4b530ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/821376fcd00fcb6b8576de1036047cb0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88fda1c823414b15050adbca75019298, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9012770d797e5e4be3bc9069f2754dc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e88131e44b96618d2ef6dfb7e6208b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac1294a6d82053549dedb56b72e76c93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b951f47f4b2cc4e267225fa79c62e7c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8068be909d65063a5aa73cb0c685d4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca73bfd75e306c6ed64df147cf023a9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc15becef32dccb6606f8703056c2f9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc3b62e65a7292e6fbda62830d3f039a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cde7df8de474b4783026fb3d36316f31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc4cd56cf01e22c09f9bdf86984d127f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e10014e0c0c97192e26f6e8b5d2e6d2b"

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.",""

Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e02e1a9f895c680cf36f0b362fda780, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15873c51041c327157baa09bf916b63f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16aef06125466962264c8c31ad9bd354, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/255d3567aee756690fbc10cf4e6e8936, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3673cac8e47920bd16b485bcaed7b384, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c1cb9f86d3d7eb0129fb55343759335, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7036223ac3b21e49e65c1d7ed421cec5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ae3a41f49e4496627d3866aaf2d9656, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ea721926ea6f82db216c2d1095502ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a38de6566720550c3d6c0b4151c3a4ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b857ddedb3e75e8456d0706898f53909, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d16f14b05b08f91019db965294325cbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d239db7e58d6ab0c249a2895609f71d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d38d7653ff39c05bf560b3d5ec20f4f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da95e8f4bcc75b28022b0edbab83b704"

A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia: although viruses are the most common etiologic agent, the severity of clinical symptoms associated with bacterial pneumonia and increasing antibiotic resistance makes bacterial pneumonia a major public health concern. Bacterial pneumonia can follow upper respiratory viral infection and complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of influenza-related deaths. In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions. We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT. However, it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in pneumonia etiology. The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co-infection, increased carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia has been established.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/066cf1eff423a5bb02700b89aea26652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eef3b88596068617a5758dd37835dad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10c5f644621c758f904be227d5b491be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19dad7d85c2120ebda65c84e66731ca3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f9c39535e01092b897a09d8e508554a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21aef50d0582dd2ee90eb22a355e5e34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bd473b82424e3892a2081aec907dc1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/372f260d6c2e4247bd529eea1f75095f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f9bf30c246b30a5ccf8ca24bf02474d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57090977fcabd272ad3d37c4db3bb469, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/686b775679960c1572e140520ff5b798, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69d32a358aaf4538f0f5639915c7bb56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b58ae8561dab8cbf590a7c3a93e91f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e6789391a07848f1874ea3b35db7930, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75ee2cd8c7d0e175f6df792f5c992413, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79c513f7a16caf189c0ebaa6d963fbf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c345b6bc300480b4d93e0c6ddd0175a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/817a3ac44ca85c77dbe05aac3af8b3ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84b306ea1c9cebbbf56713ba72d8fe93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8695ab402556be0a06216ccc7ca071f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/887939550b23aebf3833763bc85628ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92ee2142607c1432b9ed1b23dcd1f983, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ad0672eb226311f9869f14be5d6eefc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e66b0044dcd3ba7e1947741f071bb7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fcbaf33f5bc6594586a7ab81f7fa52b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6624a6f82175b8a96b3e247f559dcd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9dccf195a266f895cda8dd373fde997, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aead9704519c9ba30d6f40c860c9c168, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b36f800fc6e8404b60e3ba8e808d8d2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4a24496c3d74886d6be127535be7abc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8d92ad4f80223ca147af0c09c33c761, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c78a213da5c4779848b9e9e09018733d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d22ea0ba4705247006047980413aa8c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2e5b5909a1035ace6dc960066f5fc86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d421d501fa66a18d72bb59b661822325, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dadeaecb73513c360cc85adc2fee6023, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd56da807d70831cd1792b8be96c3a76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e16c3d1d2af2b7722fa788dca2fa68d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3e46c3c1d30360fc0438c9cdb04bad8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0066bd44dcc643e87772d6ed3073b82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b4cab2595e8b97e4c59a93781c1b93, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3ec10b7a457ae3c784b5a5e4107ace6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f44abf8b4187047fd22bdf663016292a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9db7671458d7562cb90c4b0369ed7f7"

BASIGIN controls tumour metabolism, particularly glycolysis by facilitating lactic acid export through the two monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4. However, before being recognized as a co-carrier of MCTs, BASIGIN was described as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Early on, a model emerged in which, tumour cells use the extracellular domain of BASIGIN to recognize and stimulate neighbouring fibroblasts to produce MMPs. However, this model has remained hypothetical since a direct link between BASIGIN and MMPs production has not yet been clearly established. To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma. By using co-culture experiments of either human or mouse fibroblasts and tumour cell lines we showed, contrary to what has been abundantly published, that the disruption of BASIGIN in tumour cells and in MEFs has no action on the production of MMPs. Our findings do not support the notion that the pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated via induction of MMPs. Therefore, we propose that to date, the strongest pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated through the control of fermentative glycolysis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06f9b4d9c018d9145f469b39bdf48afe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eed7e77dd8097fee2503787ffd8788a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23d6bf4c42647abf8e4e2033989ca821, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ef9327c95b755c4ca1cf6c74c1aec3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42109aa51c94cf2fe6529d6ae304aa66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47410d41e3cd9b6e7a3f7e651260ca8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a4eb1212a5211ecfc627e51edaf7df4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cf6dfef6d2421d357619d289fcd02d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/634f07a3ec561b59d688d88d81657cff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/640704af59cbb683c0f037e61b16119c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6809e7c08d88550fb2eba5adf1ce9f1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6bcb3294d596c57e49e15f64402846de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c77c5fdfb941eb4640fab7485938076, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d3ff91c549f7aac83777d80762f49bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ec470bbd88b422b5fdfc3370d129693, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90059bf166263450ea351947b949720d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fc813dfc2f1cec59b95bfc25bfe0083, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf6bbfaaabbca0aef1d3a1b80636e1db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c45ab87130f85864034241c6c06e9c34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ceef25755c0e6a61c47083bfe2c01b2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d373e6e3be645f740722e18877527207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddbe23576643d25dbc7f9171bee91c18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4a9d865328727807787e55810fc66c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef536fb7d4f6249b041e05087f056c0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f15a00db0478c5333ffa75ff3eececdb"

The acute and persistent stages of PRRSV infection are treated separately. Special attention is given to the author's work on experimental dual infections with PRRSV and other enzootic porcine respiratory viruses. It was concluded that: (1) Studies on the interactions of PRRSV and its target cell, the pulmonary alveolar macrophage, are very scarce. So far, the hypothesis of impaired macrophage function has not been proven.

Variation in disease resulting from such combined PRRSV infections will probably hamper future research into disease mechanisms.

The microtubule-associated molecular motor, cytoplasmic dynein, has been implicated in the retrograde movement of Ad. We hypothesized that cytoplasmic dynein constituted the primary mode of association of Ad with microtubules. To evaluate this hypothesis, an Ad-microtubule binding assay was established in which microtubules were polymerized with taxol, combined with Ad in the presence or absence of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and centrifuged through a glycerol cushion. The addition of purified bovine brain MAPs increased the fraction of Ad in the microtubule pellet from 17.3% ± 3.5% to 80.7% ± 3.8% (P < 0.01). In the absence of tubulin polymerization or in the presence of high salt, no Ad was found in the pellet. Ad binding to microtubules was not enhanced by bovine brain MAPs enriched for tau protein or by the addition of bovine serum albumin. Enhanced Ad-microtubule binding was also observed by using a fraction of MAPs purified from lung A549 epithelial cell lysate which contained cytoplasmic dynein. Ad-microtubule interaction was sensitive to the addition of ATP, a hallmark of cytoplasmic dynein-dependent microtubule interactions. Immunodepletion of cytoplasmic dynein from the A549 cell lysate abolished the MAP-enhanced Ad-microtubule binding. The interaction of Ad with both dynein and dynactin complexes was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation. Partially uncoated capsids isolated from cells 40 min after infection also exhibited microtubule binding. In summary, the primary mode of Ad attachment to microtubules occurs though cytoplasmic dynein-mediated binding.",""

Lentivirus-mediated TACE shRNA was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques of rabbits which effectively down-regulated TACE expression and activities from week 8 to week 16. TACE gene silencing reduced remodeling index and plaque burden, and diminished the content of macrophages and lipids while increased that of smooth muscle cells and collagen in the aortic plaques. In addition, TACE gene silencing attenuated the local expression of P65, iNOS, ICAM-1, VEGF and Flt-1 and activities of MMP9 and MMP2 while increased the local expression of TGF-β1 together with reduced number of neovessels in the aorta. TACE shRNA treatment resulted in down-regulated expression of TACE in macrophages and blunted ERK-P38 phosphorylation and tube formation of co-cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In conclusion, gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular positive remodeling. The mechanisms may involve attenuated local inflammation, neovascularization and MMP activation, as well as enhanced collagen production probably via down-regulated ERK-NF-κB and up-regulated TGF-β1 signaling pathways.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01a8245697f6381852a806b194c7f25a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03acf7a27d60bc91b9f76e1afefdb049, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0525889c7d2ac9a49611601c3eb2c6dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ce15f5503ee323343bd3529791164d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/115f533c6eb75313ef661e46cf60f1ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11cf4fc3c59f213fbf5bf30c875404db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1685384c1bd94850d485943f845dcaf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a0160eb6c6c9ae2f27de726db8a8bb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb03fd6650196b59137637e5f9a3db6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fed3eb5804c37ffd35861eaf6842cc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33c8b66632dde46aff198e09c29d6840, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3744d1901945521f61f8a4837e17e9c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a1de9d938c9cec260232bb9ba5fb721, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bc6039bfd93f99f713989c6808612f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d012fa7a8f5c87d7fb486f7683ba96b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5db8d268bffa12953d35933af776d4ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6964d40685daffd16d2a5dc852cdd24e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d5e70cab4069720b2484b337679302c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71be434797e7182be41427fa77b688ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/732088a259e4c61f0cc972ca755a7269, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f2c6467bb19fa51f680837cabf42f75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6f9ca03a6d2a25ad214861ceb32977b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5364236ddcc5788895e48f84fb19316, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6e90649f0c5ecde23352db07bd934c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b88d5db2627c418f623067d0a32b5032, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba28e89bb9b09398a71806047efefd31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6fa7bf86bb9dd3e95e0d757eaff07a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d88fb38cab07abd1d249ac015ad67240, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfb75de4ca08e82ccef40326178fd568, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e47ad01c24dad732b8aefad19504ed12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e835345e67f0f219b574834970b883b4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7ea69c183ea05fab7e465fc57052763, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8a86b339216724174e738aa6ac640f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa961a6df52fff507ef41e6b6baf8041, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd7d0404fa33a9402b400e6847276671, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fda58dac54ff7a6859ad248f313841d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdb326cd9132ea7d89d2569533acf213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffe4dcd054d695ecfeeae756f821922a"

Work-related critical incidents may induce post-traumatic stress symptoms or even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression and may negatively affect health care practitioners’ behaviors toward patients. Nurses and doctors often cope by working part time or switching jobs. Hospital administrators and health care practitioners themselves may underestimate the effects of work-related critical incidents. Relevant online databases were searched for original research published from inception to 2009 and manual searches of the Journal of Traumatic Stress, reference lists, and the European Traumatic Stress Research Database were conducted. Two researchers independently decided on inclusion and study quality. Effect sizes were estimated using standardized mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Consistency was evaluated, using the I 2-statistic. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Eleven studies, which included 3866 participants, evaluated the relationship between work-related critical incidents and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Six of these studies, which included 1695 participants, also reported on the relationship between work-related critical incidents and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Heterogeneity among studies was high and could not be accounted for by study quality, character of the incident, or timing of data collection. Pooled effect sizes for the impact of work-related critical incidents on post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression were small to medium. Remarkably, the effect was more pronounced in the longer than in the shorter term. In conclusion, this meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that work-related critical incidents are positively related to post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression in hospital-based health care professionals. Health care workers and their supervisors should be aware of the harmful effects of critical incidents and take preventive measures.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0eb179e587947ad5fc4a1542ab2ce72f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f38c5daa98fc82dfbaac0c63a61f151, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16c927c528596a912772f7abab37120b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19977fbf81fb349b799c9f832de61ba5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33073c8a16fb7abd54aec7d9f1bfb683, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47677bad5f5e6bae0a07b118d467df0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ecf2b800253884ab5c2cee6f3542817, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f7ff319da80f797be6ced3f50ffd195, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/509e2472f67f9e828b2b541166c8ab3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5731376a61ad632c8cc50ff085eca517, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/617f3c9fd5316516eda4fa7313a14943, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61a1f9b26ee60065d063462fe19d17bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66172f1cb2709cfa74860aa1b1cbff73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cd8f71c27f55f7d5e95af4213b80dc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b5752f196d2df7da2e63df17984bead, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cb66b587f9c7a17b0d0088440c2cdb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/869492483bfe286c90178e9fab92a6a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a6e9fafa1b23aa1e54f2ecfc63fc722, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b688bfe4dd8810fe22329bb2b80db68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a66580146483d26815689a3d47685268, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b079589ac29812c91c01265a4aedb7e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4e2a313c044a74cfded7f4904b32c81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3773be7300b8ff66061e1f0eb3a810c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3f2155f46d8640217eb29ea513c8592, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e42da8d5dc727d711a3c29cbcb6e6ad9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb1102c3c24d7e8bd132a0b9ab208c50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efd1c1816801fb85558d7521bac96f84, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f01754300aa3c62e0aab988090398771, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f96a1270d1e76b61c2129006304a216c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa9e0fcc8b937d77d6e9750d7cdba5a1"

However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi also plays a role in antiviral mechanism in mammalian cells. To combat RNAi-mediated antiviral responses, many viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSR) to facilitate their replication. VSRs have been widely studied for plant and insect viruses, but only a few have been defined for mammalian viruses currently. We identified a novel VSR from coronaviruses, a group of medically important mammalian viruses including Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and showed that the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of coronaviruses suppresses RNAi triggered by either short hairpin RNAs or small interfering RNAs in mammalian cells. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is closely related to SARS-CoV in the family Coronaviridae and was used as a coronavirus replication model. The replication of MHV increased when the N proteins were expressed in trans, while knockdown of Dicer1 or Ago2 transcripts facilitated the MHV replication in mammalian cells. These results support the hypothesis that RNAi is a part of the antiviral immunity responses in mammalian cells. IMPORTANCE RNAi has been well known to play important antiviral roles from plants to invertebrates. However, recent studies provided strong supports that RNAi is also involved in antiviral response in mammalian cells. An important indication for RNAi-mediated antiviral activity in mammals is the fact that a number of mammalian viruses encode potent suppressors of RNA silencing. Our results demonstrate that coronavirus N protein could function as a VSR through its double-stranded RNA binding activity. Mutational analysis of N protein allowed us to find out the critical residues for the VSR activity. Using the MHV-A59 as the coronavirus replication model, we showed that ectopic expression of SARS-CoV N protein could promote MHV replication in RNAi-active cells but not in RNAi-depleted cells. These results indicate that coronaviruses encode a VSR that functions in the replication cycle and provide further evidence to support that RNAi-mediated antiviral response exists in mammalian cells.",""

After 30 years of intensive research efforts, the structures and functions underlying their high degree of sequence conservation are not fully elucidated. The long-hydrophobic viral fusion peptide (VFP) sequences are structurally constrained to access three successive states after biogenesis. Firstly, the VFP sequence must fulfill the set of native interactions required for (meta) stable folding within the globular ectodomains of glycoprotein complexes. Secondly, at the onset of the fusion process, they get transferred into the target cell membrane and adopt specific conformations therein. According to commonly accepted mechanistic models, membrane-bound states of the VFP might promote the lipid bilayer remodeling required for virus-cell membrane merger. Finally, at least in some instances, several VFPs co-assemble with transmembrane anchors into membrane integral helical bundles, following a locking movement hypothetically coupled to fusion-pore expansion. Here we review different aspects of the three major states of the VFPs, including the functional assistance by other membrane-transferring glycoprotein regions, and discuss briefly their potential as targets for clinical intervention.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0903644e842de13524de800d74f17810, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1485410d1e8f060d3c2e1d99b634da73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23570b04053f94e1afe1756a6a727e0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/244d2bb5504b4a882a56f6cf600a73cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42d52d435b979516f6aa2a22ee431e88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53c0a58655f62fd23cf4531156c07a14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ea0c74fb2d536ba02922854405f921f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63176eabc926b6f8fba40caff8689373, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7055eb79243686a15e1abc37e96de9e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7843ba9ec81ac279aacd65910175f5a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8523bdca62cdd82a48f7108a79e83193, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85f7ec089ad1ef1e91928caccfe68986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c4a30719cb90cc0d0d3dc8332228603, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/900e8bec3e84195bceff70fe5216f998, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90f8d95d655bac59135e1ba43d40ab97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a370874c89aa8d7da0b77a92fb8e9fc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b21e746329d02554f87df313dc798fd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce0e7545103a7f0f4c3ef1ab4ab826ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d83ebcaf9bac7bd14cb65f5c9c43ccd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef2001ea7398bad4d60ebf70cf6007d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc648db4b47a18f5fe646dcb1e1709f2"

METHODS: A total of 3,527 Hong Kong Chinese adults were interviewed by telephone within the framework of six identical cross-sectional surveys carried out during the 28-month study period. Given a hypothetical scenario that two to three new human-to-human H5N1 cases had been reported in Hong Kong, the trends of the respondents in various H5N1-related risk perceptions, anticipated personal psychological responses, and anticipated personal preventive behaviors were investigated. RESULTS: Over time, a decreased proportion of the respondents (1) felt susceptible to contracting H5N1, (2) expected a large outbreak would eventually occur, (3) believed that the impacts of H5N1 were worse than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and (4) anticipated adopting more types of preventive measures and experiencing mental distress in the case of a small-scale outbreak in Hong Kong (AOR from 0.27 to 0.43, p < 0.001), but the public remained vigilant on public health behaviors, such as hand-washing. The prevalence of misconceptions on the mode of transmission declined, but remained high; perceptions on the fatality of H5N1 remained largely underestimated. The SARS experience and unconfirmed beliefs about the transmission modes were associated with variables on anticipated preventive behaviors and emotional distress. CONCLUSION: Starting in 2005 through to 2008, respondents perceived a decreasing level of susceptibility, severity, and anticipated stress towards a hypothetical human-to-human H5N1 outbreak, possibly due to the low efficiency of transmission. The public’s general preparedness was still relatively good and rational, even though individual preventive behaviors were less common. However, misconceptions were prevalent among the respondents. Based on these results, public education is warranted to rectify these misconceptions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06bc4bd7d70bb1c383cb5e57a174ab9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06e3515ecbeac1eb4d3f5588caecc67f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bc937f640e52345473948dba780cf07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a335cd6ddf76d918ca7f93f7d9bd028, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5377667e678208822bf31f00e97922f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/547bb0fad907561595002b5d64286a99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b762dece3cac58adc23adbdbad87b38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bcc3b166b90278923a9566ab0017aab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6410bdfa5b32cbda1b07fb5f7cdf6c5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69c5018ee069d6c93771b43284bd0ceb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77a7873c9116caf32ff1beb08c4d84b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cb1c28f9e24eaa8213f4aae05be71a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/810b34252761c10caadbcb3400e3a0fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d0cc3641d38c63a96c843c9205f9640, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4090bbb7c66fa11cbcef5d2ebd1da53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a620ff5d6f0e160bbc7ba944330e3d0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b15a54b81dc4db8252d6a73d7a3065ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc7ab63e20961167c9e8467966a7bb95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be01f6867ad507e4630a81a1c9322f58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5800f1d09aec674503578abdd63effc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d26f7e1d56fc30ed9cf8666eb540d070, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dea91b3f10edc26425e537e6d8531535, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6ea50a58bb53898b399ca2cb5a66783, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e940f62a321f0d2d52f3699935b364bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eae6bf39b4a58c860880b49ee84a7eb4"

We hypothesized that postnatal maturation causes developmental change in brainstem efferent airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) within the rostral nucleus ambiguus (rNA) that project to the airways, and in pulmonary afferent fibers that terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Ferrets aged 7, 14, 21 and 42 days received intrapulmonary injection of Cholera toxin β subunit (CT-b), a transganglionic retrograde tracer. Five days later, their brainstem was processed for dual immunolabeling of CT-b and the cholinergic marker, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT). CT-b labeled AVPNs and CT-b labeled afferent fiber optical density were analyzed. There was a significantly higher CT-b labeled cell number within the rNA at the youngest compared to older ages. All efferent CT-b labeled cells expressed ChAT. Optical density of CT-b labeled afferent fibers was also higher at 7 compared to 14 days. We conclude that the number of efferent AVPNs and afferent fiber optical density both diminish over the second postnatal week. We speculate that exposure to injurious agents in early postnatal life may inhibit natural remodeling and thereby enhance later vulnerability to airway hyperreactivity.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/059921122db320a1ce839373f2ef4eff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0912a3064b638125db882b55c3fc04db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ad8309bf0c1bb85d7936e60d5585c98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/165d90a030897c45a5a554e550e4b95c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c364e17374acac0cb14db809bd589e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30917a3fc42b8a48e676f3fa7b3804a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/388980d7b4ed1a2e5b77699798d1997d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a23dc36210a1b0e218b0c6fcf098882, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f4aaea64c5b165f6cc6ae66fe22a66f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45d5caa4b8828d1d12e1a7caaa3da435, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/516798e27c2231c93d079e973a842745, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55ef84f081b84f9ea5f588ceab3ebb9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e862ee97b8be5667ddb3758d6b226c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cb22fa8d7fff55d2c6faf96605af035, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75800347c3638869a54c5f693fac8fa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7652dd536190ea8623648c383f3db5eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a0d8caaa410e24000479e1c8493753d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8693a833ce3b5881032e7cb43997cc12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97c6ce96dc6dec8b7197f4f52f3101c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e3e52e63386c466ee5c88e812e781bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fb89fe4b34d12173f1cf9f6df57c055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af058d095f1eea91ea1175fdcff0cd9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbeeb0350917a507ca7342b4a186662b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c70e477dada38f1f4d3d92dc929d145e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce18fdcdaa958e580dd1049af2faf128, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5498a82d4fdfdd978ce047ef2693218, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da547c375cb7878a13578f64c46da905, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbd7719a1eb307d37c27f3c3ad693d9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef02783fe714bbc1dd32adc11cc69525, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f768f6b036ec3462606ca6a79d239b13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f82e73b71445bae4471a8165e47441d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbceff38526faf1d4de21a934d65af16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd6db7efaea78db24074e4441ae27b5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe7f4fc9b52bdc5e4d999aa71d5fd614"

Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03d7f69f93f1ff7446bc8b12593c2802, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/133287e894f977340e5cfcc503717b4c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/170bd194fd89509d4503d47d5dde7eb4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18ffd11783e7cde83876b062e2e0f4c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3185909ef07fe39dc614e2eeec899210, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a8fd9e07da3abac38bcf32a28f724c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/440dde2bc9c140fab408214b97a72158, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/461d1b6bcb98aea5c175ff8f6a85a964, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/473a09faabe2683d3034146d8c999db2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/506aec50002343f784605e55a4e4c46d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6007de78b7315d2625efd38b6742ce22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/643820eb655cf08e64ffb626c6068ce2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68955d3721211001122b49754bb274ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/690c868ff5c2af72b43c8188670620c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b5e4bf76227d74d838233d38ea18d2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7032b7cef611729f64b3bb288d755a6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7261914cc71e11b58906bd341d9be119, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85a022c64515860b773204de3d09cc5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fc4d0466c238fb6637704197625bc7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92af620321e110f83422b0a2ec0ab637, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a4dce30f215a48910c20c69aad1c40c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1ff331d55da3894ec5eade9538845ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad08c309f4f435ca330e814f7e3d03d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afb57bdb6adba8f6ce575901df975991, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/beb51591ef166f438a418f4edf63582b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2ebd35dc8f3930768a42abc42a48472, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c90642bf68ab656e829f273d25ef722e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cee699b91baf7882f473c91706a77e67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0457876c15769ff929c5ee381bcc184, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e18b540f2c992b3c085d935f6a70fa9f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec8e21b0c246761de98eed3ed18b8d27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9e1916d4cf537183ab384ca0dd2746f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc3140b44991ed2b7affb4ca0553093a"

It recognizes several pathogens of important public health concern. In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution.

The peptides are stored inside the cells in dense core secretory granules until released in a stimulus dependent manner. The complexity of the regulation of the biosynthesis, trafficking and secretion of POMC and its peptides reflect an impressive level of control over many factors involved in the ultimate role of POMC expressing cells, i.e. to produce a range of different biologically active peptide hormones ready for action when signaled by the body. From the discovery of POMC as the precursor to ACTH and β-Lipotropin in the late 1970s to our current knowledge, the understanding of POMC physiology remains a monumental body of work that has provided insight into many aspects of molecular endocrinology. In this chapter, we describe the intracellular trafficking of POMC in endocrine cells, its sorting into dense core secretory granules and transport of these granules to the regulated secretory pathway. Additionally, we review the enzymes involved in the maturation of POMC to its various peptides and the mechanisms involved in the differential processing of POMC in different cell types.

Here we report a method for eliminating false-negative results and increasing test sensitivity, based on the hypothesis that the message encoded by the nucleocapsid (N) gene is the most abundant during viral infection. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool samples were obtained from suspected SARS patients with major clinical symptoms and a significant history of close contact with infected patients. Total RNAs were extracted in a 96-well format, together with pig kidney epithelial (PK-15) cells as an internal control for extraction efficiency. PCR inhibitors were removed by ethanol precipitation, and a PCR for the pig β-actin gene was used as a positive control for all clinical samples. Samples were analyzed by a reverse transcriptase PCR assay. Northern blot analysis was performed to demonstrate differences in subgenomic transcripts of the virus, and a real-time quantitative PCR was employed to compare the sensitivities of two loci (1b and N). The detection rate of the assay reached 44.4% on day 9 after the onset of the disease. The diagnostic PCR amplifying the N gene gave an average of a 26.0% (6.3 to 60.0%) stronger intensity signal than that for the 1b gene. In conclusion, the nucleocapsid gene represents an additional sensitive molecular marker for the diagnosis of the SARS coronavirus and can be further adapted for use in a high-throughput platform assay.",""

Because elderly individuals are vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections, these microbial agents may be considered important comorbidities that could potentiate an already existing and tenuous inflammatory condition in the brain, accelerating cognitive decline, particularly if the cellular and molecular mechanisms can be defined. Researchers have recently demonstrated that triggering inflammation in the brain exacerbates tau pathological characteristics in animal models. Herein, we explore whether inflammation induced via viral infection, compared with inflammation induced via bacterial lipopolysaccharide, modulates AD-like pathological features in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infectious agents may act as a comorbidity for AD. Our study shows that infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation significantly exacerbates tau pathological characteristics, with chronic inflammation leading to impairments in spatial memory. Tau phosphorylation was increased via a glycogen synthase kinase-3β–dependent mechanism, and there was a prominent shift of tau from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble fraction. During chronic inflammation, we found that inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity with lithium reduced tau phosphorylation and the accumulation of insoluble tau and reversed memory impairments. Taken together, infectious agents that trigger central nervous system inflammation may serve as a comorbidity for AD, leading to cognitive impairments by a mechanism that involves exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/117cdce4d3d64f42a2ee19cf2f276c38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/17b8d8144c966eeb1f9517c15deefc51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d27e64d0adca31664778ee26ea839c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fa36e60f1d9532f1a1b607ab04e682a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fccd19539f3d09b4e1090c87bf0e425, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21b9adfff7e9e39a926c13636f925368, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/284b758e90d6844e3dd19aeaa0b5915c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c1f6ae84151c114e9a98cc76cb1ce53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33d45fc05b869f5019134c1a4c6f102d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34ce7f7e69ce843cf4663625bde1a0d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3572e654af7641f57364c746f7b2a6a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dcdbffd2817691b864ef159cba91a4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fe91fb16796995fba00b98b22fe2685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4573c8b9290cb87a0a700e86b6feb1ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d187635dda5c3dbd24332a254d7b614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55008555135439527e46e6f7e16642c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a71d935a7ad9ee7bed44d37430da193, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e1f4abf82860070cf99e8897c07cd9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76dc8d0acbb52c138b4a78fc6ee86752, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e3c6c73630de0c4d7227f0ccbc5bbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b9e1e87d40dd8e209d28f3029bbac5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8094f61890364d5304649ab04b2bba1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83232a65241a6eeb9df2d047eada1b09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84f352d776b09036a433839366009a5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87c832639454b31bcd6145ba0b9208a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88d51690f775fcd03be7f1cb7141eaa9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e1340ca3cd2428c6cfb843839f374d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ed81ffb7bc249507e3e99d1d04696eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b52f007e35312157649352de3aefbdc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb8a14205e946e828cbd7217e1dc8ca7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c30ee4978cf5152a700c978cad328c50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8d4e176f4f3a3ee94eef17dd9f838ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc289f7835ca3483d31a57504b1bbbf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcf61fec1253478f43b8a7c542f3cce3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3c5bf0588e7a488122e0167b04ef158, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eccea403b4372c6d714d0dedbf576341, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f31fcdd37c649cbb0a212dc1b8f2e4cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbb84bc3e0ebcbc0c0f9342b99a3d9e9"

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that counteract the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN also functions to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(−)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(−) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor-deficient (IFNAR(−/−)) BMMs. ExoN(−) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(−) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to those of untreated samples. However, ExoN(−) virus generated from IFN-β-pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(−) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest murine hepatitis virus (MHV) ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response, and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity. IMPORTANCE CoVs encode multiple antagonists that prevent or disrupt an efficient innate immune response. Additionally, no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines currently exist for human CoV infections. Therefore, the study of CoV innate immune antagonists is essential for understanding how CoVs overcome host defenses and to maximize potential therapeutic interventions. Here, we sought to determine the contributions of nsp14 ExoN activity in the induction of and resistance to the innate immune response. We show that viruses lacking nsp14 ExoN activity are more sensitive than wild-type MHV to restriction by exogenous IFN-β and that viruses produced in the presence of an antiviral state are less capable of establishing a subsequent viral infection. Our results support the hypothesis that murine hepatitis virus ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response.",""

Over the past few decades, a rapid development in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has resulted in the widespread use of this technique not only as an environmental research tool but also as an architectural design tool. However, given real building morphologies and particular architectural requirements for the modeling and data analysis, the frequently used methods in research work are unsuitable for practical application. Therefore, this study focuses on the practical application of CFD to bridge the gap between wind engineering and architectural design. This study aims to provide a framework to accurately predict the pedestrian level wind environment, and identify the wind-related design issues. The methods are provided to answer the questions encountered by wind consultants and architects, particularly those on the input boundary condition, simulation modeling, modeling verification, data collection and analysis. The hypothesis testing method is introduced in the framework to verify and evaluate the simulation results. A Hong Kong case study is presented to illustrate that the framework and methods can work well.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/265e269bb0eb4c941fc5e9c9788baa94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45f9285004a55297a20f22dc29ec46a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57c0c77716c6d456e43423c37b00502b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65912cca7e473a6fbb591cde1c3050d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7026a8c83e72f53c56b83b18b05c8fed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7842e07d78e5efd85b67691f3dfeae3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87bc9e167ff636d223c2fc24596685fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89f33b161a6883c10716c19590aaf383, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92ea09f6cc8807b188bbe1f3ba8cb281, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97b6ad112d0dc361c1d463556b61c051, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c539686c8b0c31f980520f9c4203b8a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db507ff6bd4ca4a03957dd1017302691, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dfb842a99467d8aa899e4e6557a2eba5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5f25a77e4b5a9ccbd0752f624c38aec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9b1ec124c45a70087804a2cdc8aaa5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb6ff7af923652711455335cfe82fca7"

It has been hypothesized that if COVID-19 exhibits seasonality, changing temperatures in the coming months will shift transmission patterns around the world. Such projections, however, require an estimate of the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature at a global scale, and one that isolates the role of temperature from confounding factors, such as public health capacity. This paper provides the first plausibly causal estimates of the relationship between COVID-19 transmission and local temperature using a global sample comprising of 166,686 confirmed new COVID-19 cases from 134 countries from January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020. We find robust statistical evidence that a 1°C increase in local temperature reduces transmission by 13% [-21%, -4%, 95%CI]. In contrast, we do not find that specific humidity or precipitation influence transmission. Our statistical approach separates effects of climate variation on COVID-19 transmission from other potentially correlated factors, such as differences in public health responses across countries and heterogeneous population densities. Using constructions of expected seasonal temperatures, we project that changing temperatures between March 2020 and July 2020 will cause COVID-19 transmission to fall by 43% on average for Northern Hemisphere countries and to rise by 71% on average for Southern Hemisphere countries. However, these patterns reverse as the boreal winter approaches, with seasonal temperatures in January 2021 increasing average COVID-19 transmission by 59% relative to March 2020 in northern countries and lowering transmission by 2% in southern countries. These findings suggest that Southern Hemisphere countries should expect greater transmission in the coming months. Moreover, Northern Hemisphere countries face a crucial window of opportunity: if contagion-containing policy interventions can dramatically reduce COVID-19 cases with the aid of the approaching warmer months, it may be possible to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 next winter.",""

However, the effects of EE devices on normal physiology and scientific outcomes must be evaluated. We hypothesized that the spectral transmittance (color) of light to which rats are exposed when inside colored enrichment devices (CED) affects the circadian rhythms of various plasma markers. Pair-housed male Crl:SD rats were maintained in ventilated racks under a 12:12-h light:dark environment (265.0 lx; lights on, 0600); room lighting intensity and schedule remained constant throughout the study. Treatment groups of 6 subjects were exposed for 25 d to a colored enrichment tunnel: amber, red, clear, or opaque. We measured the proportion of time rats spent inside their CED. Blood was collected at 0400, 0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, and 2400 and analyzed for plasma melatonin, total fatty acids, and corticosterone. Rats spent more time in amber, red, and opaque CED than in clear tunnels. All tubes were used significantly less after blood draws had started, except for the clear tunnel, which showed no change in use from before blood sampling began. Normal peak nighttime melatonin concentrations showed significant disruption in the opaque CED group. Food and water intakes and body weight change in rats with red-tinted CED and total fatty acid concentrations in the opaque CED group differed from those in other groups. These results demonstrate that the color of CED altered normal circadian rhythms of plasma measures of metabolism and physiology in rats and therefore might influence the outcomes of scientific investigations.",""

Here, we used a large dataset from 357 lions comprehending 1.13 megabases of sequence data and genotypes from 22 microsatellite loci to characterize its recent evolutionary history. Patterns of molecular genetic variation in multiple maternal (mtDNA), paternal (Y-chromosome), and biparental nuclear (nDNA) genetic markers were compared with patterns of sequence and subtype variation of the lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV(Ple)), a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In spite of the ability of lions to disperse long distances, patterns of lion genetic diversity suggest substantial population subdivision (mtDNA Φ(ST) = 0.92; nDNA F (ST) = 0.18), and reduced gene flow, which, along with large differences in sero-prevalence of six distinct FIV(Ple) subtypes among lion populations, refute the hypothesis that African lions consist of a single panmictic population. Our results suggest that extant lion populations derive from several Pleistocene refugia in East and Southern Africa (∼324,000–169,000 years ago), which expanded during the Late Pleistocene (∼100,000 years ago) into Central and North Africa and into Asia. During the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (∼14,000–7,000 years), another expansion occurred from southern refugia northwards towards East Africa, causing population interbreeding. In particular, lion and FIV(Ple) variation affirms that the large, well-studied lion population occupying the greater Serengeti Ecosystem is derived from three distinct populations that admixed recently.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05d6d0b55def9685d980d1503f31e6bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14d30305b3f42727ecef1e62a0f82adf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1683f17bb1f741beb97cb164ce574345, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18be58c3bd4ddfde19155e6c9424afad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bfd45a5616b8237a1b2b74273e39485, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a977b8845123702fcffc305f72b5684, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cc5dcc223d6ac5e361ff4d7f6fceba6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3119ff4f0404bd25bd41127515c25447, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3135f11e03dd1126fb47d10401cda831, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33461fd786dacd95764c9f5b2515ce22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/336d16d912ec8c05d0c28f65e3162a77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e0e8138827eb5b445d25e044450a4ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ddfcbea05bebf11e7ea2b8982c59769, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5103e57f6193db17a731ad68f65648bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53b2c8ef8e1afa199abbdd332bb9d672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58fe668afdb5c4e9d8c3d6e05496e0de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6189b5244f73250f9a72764ea49be916, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61d41ae1b878c2d7f571066ec283ef27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75edf81f598d7f7b813a6a677b7b399b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7892df864bd88ce7a9e24a8ea0944057, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8335738a80adba4c999919523234ef62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/905900000bc98cb8df194dd58c9aa729, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/922880677ebaa485087a86dbedaf2652, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/935069246d50e05acc267848edf99dea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9732f0e4cc35244dafe51c91a023e66d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eb740f9e0afaf64c155737d015c2284, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3b559652f187b522b1f91912d1c11ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6dbd0138db7cb463625fd793972803f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b141275c2e5c5a3c6810a1d37bbd5b65, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5434a002d30f12a4c3a136954498b94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b824e49092860405da718f8dc64fa423, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bafb6e97ee1ad5a82bf188596b10d16d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcc6cf6c2efd14ff3bda9b94b42b2a56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcfeee4ded3d98b5386c5cd91507e6e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbe9c5902fb9bc9af14b3d4162f51625, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d480886ad9fa90f0d7207dce918f0770, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d689cf288cf9198da225ae45de98fc2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d690c0e649fbd3fe0c31148790338e0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6d850129ede2ef6eb4607b8b227406a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec6162c37c10d9cd33e06138286d15f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4d26a9eeb2a87032ebab91f221be5b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fbf0874d3b92fa82ceebf0cd4c20a6db"

The current study tested the hypothesis that a short period of fasting (3 h) prior to induction with intraperitoneal KX anesthesia would provide a shorter time to recumbency, a longer total sleep time, and a more consistent loss of toe pinch response than would fed rats. Two groups of male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in blinded, crossover experiments. KX anesthesia was administered at 2 different doses (50 mg/kg–5 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg–7 mg/kg) after ad libitum feeding or a 3-h fast. There were no significant differences between groups in induction time, total sleep time, or loss of toe pinch response.

Because immune suppression is a major component in the pathology of FIP, we hypothesized that treatment with an immune system stimulant would increase survival times of cats with dry FIP. Sixty cats, diagnosed with dry FIP by primary care and specialist veterinarians and meeting the acceptance criteria, were treated with PI without intentional selection of less severe cases. The survival time from the start of PI treatment in cats diagnosed with dry FIP showed that of the 60 cats with dry FIP treated with PI, 8 survived over 200 days, and 4 of 60 survived over 300 days. A literature search identified 59 cats with non-effusive or dry FIP; no cat with only dry FIP lived longer than 200 days. Veterinarians of cats treated with PI that survived over 30 days reported improvements in clinical signs and behavior. The survival times in our study were significantly longer in cats who were not treated with corticosteroids concurrently with PI. While not a cure, PI shows promise in the treatment of dry form FIP, but a controlled study will be needed to verify the benefit.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04f6b622ca6dfb68aa73b6f99f5c6f81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1982784d75cf9b5600779656a65f7775, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31c49f1b9bcea86c0b48d7052d1b7381, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32c72bdca5312526fd7c3117010e08a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/377401bca26607f1501625552e47ea58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a31a820e9624257fa50b2128a77bbe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ad1a3a6fb13e7a40e251b1716303e8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eae1c61c42fa374cc276f4886fcc968, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/645c2add9eed88e3958a95e7175dc58e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76debdb4cd24ce20e5f2fef779464c5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/855cc3970ee0266abf36d37ceae69eae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98fda58b90991fcf8b9e7e5222d749f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b40c9fbdb139502deaccd2fb62b0170, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a77be8d2974f9c58794cdcd1630a3958, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba5a62c547125867f1aeddbcdb517684, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c262cb9a60285702a2fa8eccadc11c6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2b3a9822804ed1b56a2bba0d70b0fbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c365a9b4a3a9079db65250d292ec60c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c93f1d76767fd887976feccadcf9c833, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddfce155b09b148ed9afdb261e64e90e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0f813e488bff764e58d5bcf81960451, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb299fc57eb7ec287cdb66a3b7768897, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eea145ac3c8c55af1d30b7c04b3b07b1"

The increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARγ2). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPARγ2 expression in either ON(+ )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group. CONCLUSION: These findings support our hypothesis that there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated osteonecrosis development.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/081a9c022f3daa0323c8634204fe6ad3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c39e50fd61f39bbf487d9c6bfff2201, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21dd5f147eeab07a09f6f3aa9125e4ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/270c1c35edea4423c98d285b55681643, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65f0742c52d29963982560b246c0a048, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a187ee8c71af69d33b43244e52a1e571, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c968613ef080f871080fe506628ebe7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9f6d27475a98c5d873f0f6d58ef6fc8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd9b2727d5415578aa2e31c01dde203d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0de6b649e4336698f54fd13d1206db8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc2a2cf4c033a6db04e9c9e9913842f5"

Therefore, I reviewed the literature on LPAIV infections in wild waterbirds. The virulence of LPAIV was assessed in 17 studies on experimental infections and nine studies on natural infections. Reported evidence for virulence were reductions in return rate, feeding rate, body weight, long-range movement and reproductive success, as well as pathological changes in infected organs. However, major caveats in studies of experimental infections were unnatural route of LPAIV inoculation, animal husbandry not simulating natural stressors and low sensitivity of clinical assessment. Major caveats in studies of natural infections were incomplete measurement of LPAIV infection burden, quasi-experimental design and potential misclassification of birds. After taking these caveats into account, the only remaining evidence for virulence was that presence and intensity of LPAIV infection were negatively correlated with body weight. Based on this correlation, together with the demonstrated LPAIV tropism for the intestinal tract, I hypothesize that LPAIV reduces digestive tract function, and suggest how future studies could be directed to test this hypothesis.",""

Recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity. Trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and Nagana in livestock in sub-Saharan endemic areas. In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07237d975d71aabea6c6506a17b2f632, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07529ff3a0f10326ca7bbb19ad277a05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15d998d15ca922a1869b7c517fd9ca8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/18455b382f8c7c8ee822bf4fc499c386, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/19e4c15ba87d3527c9d145e2fd91071e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c0a97a589df5503597ca194c2a5dad6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f3853ae800e2a34ba77c7d9d7c51644, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27b5d98403458324ece0e475492b1d80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e0abc219e55f6a9201c030f54664e34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33238f002c9aee10e6acf094b6133340, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33716cc4fa020ebea27b826e0ee20261, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/458482896baf4d73f452404023b25d0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47771a10bdafe1563259912a97757896, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/636e897009e1f83dcf5b674fdc71498f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/649fa61bcfe93654710f618ec7548076, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/64d650d06acf1c14deedbec84d108ec9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6609d1ebf51c80f2de8278dc9d8dd5c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f76a6aca24e75def5ab58d0eecfc95f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ae4c7a56f42e694354b03d2544491ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e5a3685c1729c3f6c70c87ae8594740, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81950faf1983cea5f49fe7a5391baf5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81dbf105085e9f0db9841197a652a095, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/828f3a5e346936444d196feaa831a1be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2f8e11ee505e5620b6641f6d1e12680, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7ac73d87b2bb7c93c6b03775dcda031, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adf1493e4545d1db31fb5a895527948e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6dac09a69f0f02a164817abc75fe213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7b0b69d67be05e012141434bb572b5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c15e0809c3832ca1d1368295057d3871, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c402252504b4765bc9fc5e4cce88d9f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbf1e18d41bfb87e80288a58a0422d2a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d65325251f832d4320fe8ac933f7fccd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d9416ca0b75fbf8f4fe4381bf986bbfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dae4d0c15c6ef478301a8f6a32642b2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/db6f4cfcfc8da0e4710c75c61a82d859, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de6dace6561f6b5421ca17961e22699c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de7627a0c263a457443c26788f340c13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec3a29ea6968bbbc455c618503d3ff00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ede22a8f7f55039b503415eeb5189ea0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef028b9f60aef1b3cc3bc8cb1af1f242, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1f154e53e414db25856d49be9852068, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa390615181ba86743ad6bdd7e54fa0d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fab66d031d966d1651df24768129ca3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcd80e96e28dc704181b72bad2448b56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fcf20ba9a58c608dd1e73f7ec404e2e4"

The analgesic plan included the use of buprenorphine SR LAB (0.6 mg/kg; 0.11 mL/rat) subcutaneously and an oral NSAID delivered via the water. Thirty-seven rats reached the experimental end point at 3 mo after xenotransplantation and were euthanized for tissue harvest. Grossly, all 37 rats had nodules in the subcutis over the shoulders; these were identified as small, cystic structures (diameter, approximately 0.25 cm). The cysts and haired skin were submitted for LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) and histopathology. Histologically, the cysts were lined by fibrous connective tissue mildly infiltrated by macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Adjacent blood vessels were rimmed by a mild infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The cysts contained variable accumulations of a light pink, proteinaceous fluid. The cause for the cysts could not be determined histologically; there was no evidence of neoplasia. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the cysts contained buprenorphine. We hypothesize that the lack of T cells and a cell-mediated immune response in these rats prevented the dissolution of the vehicle and absorption of the buprenorphine. The manufacturer provides a cautionary statement regarding the use of this formulation in nude mice due to skin reactions, but to our knowledge, this report is the first description of an apparent lack of absorption of the drug in immunodeficient animals.",""

This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2509308b4e56aefee816b0e713ccc37e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2978a30f763faf0d0d62119c8a381d85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30c5578bbecf835d937dea72d1799808, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/312b0a23fcb201544ae53e0e4b51ccfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40b133849e7d53027e2e57d19ddb6dd5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/494f359820baffd292ea19ea695ca34e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c4fc0f1080e76ff0609fd38d975d235, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e846212d6b3554f0f905d2a43005346, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51e7401174b6cbf297297ec9ad5f8ccc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/591bed0e0857c23f31b664c2a202a2a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74cf019cc97d0e0ddea7e26fbda3a4bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d162be67b09be93ca8461e30133abb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7df1fdc84b28ddb631e0d4d403a55f9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/852767f7d4bd932172d4a4ea224c947c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/882de2af6f6387bf6d323fe5da7f430c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93086376093aeffd358cd7f0cf494c16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1f78b3d5abc78383ab35e62e1cb1c80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a71c2ac3d895050bc9ca519740be660d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7f0cce6808af1193364d8cd07a2dc6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a94a6831be3bb210f15fe7270a41e0ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acabaa2379b047457fcf89760aa60078, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfa0817846fc91ca718b9f463bb2afc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2cd56c73e0d43b854ba41a3fa14f567, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c55a8fc01005b195697a97945998ea4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d604046f796708c5934766d199d03167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7c1594658f40bf789681003e7dc804e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d94ec7966c892a70dfb96c9663f912f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e59561c1f4247b7e855b11ead943a7c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec6adfa50d528fc73583b6a6b4e8d551, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2447a7caea912fddbdae98cde987964, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f43b70349b088f6f5e8754df2e9fc6f7"

We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04f87b90397368887078d16707c7a344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13bc8379df064ee1451f0348cccaf7ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48c2d191ebee693888376d26c85aca20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4914d7d8b17799d05b2a91a32a2eddc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a1622f220d4b0c5eca00a3965931a06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62041758ea607d8cd0565a1ba340ddd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68c766a36b918e68b8dcf732975f964a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7667ac2b6cd9779799ab83642ce1a21c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b4f242b9d3d5a220fc4557f73c9ab50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/989aa19eff018352b4b13b50a15c5863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d33861cd50f21a5d80a19c7894972437"

Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). METHODS: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.

RESULTS: We presented the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved. CONCLUSIONS: The presented model allows to capture the essential dynamics of relapsing-remitting MS despite its simplicity. It gave useful insights that support the hypothesis of a breakdown of Teff-Treg cross balancing mechanisms.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c0b332f99383639ca44111b22817de7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1367c2b699861b8d34735bea07fe1906, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1eef7491846ba6ef2eb8c60663bfe40f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2fe47ea5d6dc280ee4f53387642845d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/550960732fffe00c890a52e7c64c9470, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f28a0757c580359132be64e1b3dfebe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77063b360857fc9d57cb08cfabda3f8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f69f4788b5e646ef50c03ff5a2ebbea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8429e6d153327a11907d99a2b9474cc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9439aeb4c58f6d999fb50d6865f48ba7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c214be2bfda0621a1f40400fefa994f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3b9fb3e20568d1262432e3197de0ba1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c55c4542307d50ec16986464385f95ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c738a2c306605584440475748b58ecf4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c96b3cae5805dc41a7d51312a4466787, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ddaae1a508591173886b4f6c107e0ee7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7ba881237b83ac6c063f89b7b881f69"

Structure studies of the full-length form of the obligate hexameric enzyme from two CoVs, SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus, and its monomeric homologue, XendoU from Xenopus laevis, combined with mutagenesis studies have implicated several residues in enzymatic activity and the N-terminal domain as the major determinant of hexamerization. However, the tight link between hexamerization and enzyme activity in NendoUs has remained an enigma. Here, we report the structure of a trimmed, monomeric form of SARS-CoV nsp15 (residues 28 to 335) determined to a resolution of 2.9 Å. The catalytic loop (residues 234 to 249) with its two reactive histidines (His 234 and His 249) is dramatically flipped by ∼120° into the active site cleft. Furthermore, the catalytic nucleophile Lys 289 points in a diametrically opposite direction, a consequence of an outward displacement of the supporting loop (residues 276 to 295). In the full-length hexameric forms, these two loops are packed against each other and are stabilized by intimate intersubunit interactions. Our results support the hypothesis that absence of an adjacent monomer due to deletion of the hexamerization domain is the most likely cause for disruption of the active site, offering a structural basis for why only the hexameric form of this enzyme is active.",""

In order to study whether HBoV1 can cause RTI, we investigated its presence in children with upper RTI (URTI), lower RTI (LRTI) and a control group of children without RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and blood samples were collected from children admitted to hospital with RTI from 6 June 2007 to 28 February 2009 (n =1154), and from children admitted for elective surgery who had no RTI (n =162). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the NPAs were examined for 17 infectious agents including HBoV1. Blood samples were tested with HBoV1-PCR only. Results HBoV1 was detected in NPAs from 10% of patients and 17% of controls. Adjusted for age, gender and the presence of other viruses, HBoV1 was not associated with RTI. In the HBoV1-positive NPAs, at least one other virus was detected in 75% and the virus appeared alone in 25%. Adjusted for age and gender, the detection of HBoV1 as the sole virus was associated with RTI, but not with LRTI. Viraemia was found only in children with RTI. The study showed that it was associated with RTI and LRTI. A high HBoV1-load was associated with LRTI, but not with RTI. No interactions between HBoV1 and other infectious agents were found. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group. However, HBoV1 is common in healthy children.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e5c9986f14d6d5835f3f550d54f6db2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1096a8513bc638a8c106e8f2a5364a87, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c5706ef6343e78919cfaab8df77c603, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1f4cab83f735c3a4cfcdfa60a96879a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f6b1f220455c8ef47dda081ec480c1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49caef1d57c129329a6072c09f5c10f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53469771e7ba5eed493eefdb7dc93cd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53f01a2c06a60933999928920dcd013d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54a87d8e8586c4b73ea906f25f6c0ff3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5838d122003fdce5eff21d5073891fff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c8f7b1d05891101a8115982ff3d63bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6312f726e8cffbd0420858725362f618, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/673fab5df39baec3eb8b9d99629ba002, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6879580ed48ac409362a1a7dcb1302fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75130499d6d4f0e4de9663930227966f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/777c26e9da04eb42ae4a20a4696e0970, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b4bd131e3ae2bdf878009d349406b45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e84bf82c2581ac973fd7efd10ccd813, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/823b0c7831559e652ac4c23d058aa876, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8657e32ef3ba13ce5db6208a5c625e3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90cfb4c19ef94ed75466fedf99286773, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/961cae8802d6d29d7bc8b27d99fc7172, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/990bfd7c7db943def0ecfa2b55295796, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a864724873332ee7cd0a5689dedb1208, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa4a29405e424dadf6213a14245c7edd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b22057e071c5af28ad60ade5e584e6ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b919379d23d468887085ae3fc4deabed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbedf548c4b9410f26b35e403d67e829, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf7c7fe4a1e4a7f39d9c30805d686d0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd7727ec60913ce91820ff4ffd2efa68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea5def2dcf574cb0ea1c270124ef5ce6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb4a4dcc7fb43dfab938aef4cf188f28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef3ebf1ec19f4de0deef94a2237598d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3691889acdccdcd711f48072bfd065b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc0d6db2622b41f199389acf71a1ac31, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffbec1318a7746638a304bfbb2c576cf"

Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime. CONCLUSION: There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of isolation facilities. With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/013803e7711172a444b2c15cf33b3188, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1927b7525308804a377e61635c334451, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ed52a3d277e5cd37da78c4c16b19ac7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/350d0c67c659d15a4ada102954342e24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/57692fc23cf607331939ca6ee736c741, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a2cf40590610b9d1efacf0959eeda50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6db74ee2904379063b94646afc0015a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89c4bf3474abae97a95bf228429532b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4a9c771a1b49bb7b4294e5f4a510abc"

However, the mechanism governing cbDVG generation remains unknown, thereby limiting our ability to manipulate cbDVG content in order to modulate the host response to infection. Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of RSV cbDVGs. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced a specific cbDVG based on variations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a common site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs generated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome are critical determinants of the location of cbDVG generation and, therefore, this is not a stochastic process. Most importantly, these findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome.Author summaryCopy-back defective viral genomes (cbDVGs) regulate infection and pathogenesis of Mononegavirales. cbDVG are believed to arise from random errors that occur during virus replication and the predominant hypothesis is that the viral polymerase is the main driver of cbDVG generation. Here we describe a specific genomic sequence in the RSV genome that is necessary for the generation of a large proportion of the cbDVG population present during infection. We identified specific nucleotides that when modified altered cbDVG generation at this position, and we created a recombinant virus that selectively produced cbDVGs based on mutations in this sequence. These data demonstrate that the generation of RSV cbDVGs is regulated by specific viral sequences and that these sequences can be manipulated to alter the content and quality of cbDVG generated during infection.",""

Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-α supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-α responses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01a41ec2518a49e856c67bf5819d4756, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04ce33cc31607fd996b7718a43f317df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0590a7b8be932d38a17a0e832452d94b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05f5c0285230876b91e7b2c2d753363e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a7b96f2e1315013851f6fa573cb0494, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c7c0e042ce6dafd1cc1ec553dc5cebd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20b054999623fdec45574e915bf57044, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/283ba76216e92184badb6eafc8803bfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a02af449232489176ce37477d8dcdd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43078daab14d9f1e9cc9636d876940f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5293388c9b0c3ff1b817e0931035d9f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60dfaf946ff34b21878ee427ad03428a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b3ff820e27896e63c1942e1394d138b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/719806a3c89bbe0e153587341efb613a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76d4541614fbe57785b402a68e0840c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a015760f20733d5c868b5962c824273, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8221ed6669bd6a2a0be29c58b62a2edd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8390b3a06b5783b9a0a5a686c2fa1e1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/886445e9798b55bb0965884ec6898dd7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8892620ec57d7825e92cf6cbc87a8cab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89029fb5281354e789b75c7e8c0beb30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91817d2ac6ef9185a16229471c3039b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93ee5a256f29e8d600f27e2f4008f888, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a89c517271fca5a0fc9de5f074152a08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab5e82066a5f761f7da0f122e2bee1b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3a01449dce07f80d1cf7d7228335877, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b457a810a9d6ef659914643f02a39d81, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7e9d5eca3439696dd496595530fc6e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba168795d799fb33f594a545b4de6dd2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf97758d3edd0eb6ee913dda9d083e6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c068756da81fb58cfd6c42cf6dde2087, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0776c1a105cf51cb4a435abd312e474, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5f6bf79b5a1c1a65b888524975e02db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c975d8dd736510bc3bee8b1ab8ce3ded, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1b270cf86735b1f6fbd98c6e974a42e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1fb3c9a3e836699f80b93365518653d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8cff2390e6cafe0f97bec006945937f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e517c703ee90e8d60f838234e045c697, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef7cee851ae31908fec0ac758a33b158, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5c620e90ca789f7f3b986a9c749c89b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f73accb9fd35ea8b33f4b898787aacc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f89b63943490dc31ecf4fffb0b67915f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f978c890428b9b4e3f9b02cc20733c65"

As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host’s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/305ef606384368987abf6a5ceaa2bc95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6402b22d8e110c467434634a533acc18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65e6dbd08a6af86b0f0a99ce22d6c67c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a962b5c13a7e0086650d05adb14f77b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c62f9dc7ab09a150cd2ddf22318b6e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/983c03194fb9f0902d5b3d6b9fa55740, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a60b883e9bdfa3b121df95c1ffe87d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbaa184c253035e5ab8939c99bd0a2de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d246352343651eca7ac78bc5641f0cbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa9b0342a1e62978373f5de005ce6657"

We hypothesized that non-HTX CHD infants with CD will also have increased postoperative morbidity, particularly respiratory complications. METHODS: Sixty-three infants with non-HTX CHD undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled. Tests commonly used to assess for CD, nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurements and nasal epithelial ciliary motion (CM) assessment, were obtained. Baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Non-HTX CHD infants exhibited a high prevalence of abnormal CM (32%) and low nNO (39%). This was not correlated with demographics or surgical complexity. Infants with abnormal CM had increased odds of requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (OR 6.5, CI 1.5–29.4, P = 0.016) and respiratory medication use (OR 4.4, CI 1.5–13.3, P = 0.01). In contrast, infants with low nNO showed evidence of abnormal pre- and postoperative systolic function (40% vs. 4%; P = 0.004, and 34% vs. 13%; P = 0.056, respectively) and had higher odds of acquiring infections (OR 4.9, CI 1.4–17, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Non-HTX CHD infants with abnormal CM showed increased postoperative morbidity associated with poor respiratory outcomes. In contrast, low nNO correlated with reduced hemodynamic function. These findings suggest screening for abnormal CM may allow perioperative interventions to reduce pulmonary morbidities. Whether low nNO may prognosticate poor hemodynamic function warrants further investigation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cdf1447945dba75b5ffcfea1898bce8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42b88218cd383a14783fe002e444292d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43ae0778e36c48542a884b63d219c2d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad2463035bdca48075c152c0c00e502f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c93ac0f41a6177b9a9b6a1731ee24da4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fee74bfe8d3c5e24e8fbd92b8611ca5c"

Most of them do not have tRNAs, their translation relies on hosts' tRNA pools. Over the course of evolution, viruses needed to optimally exploit cellular processes of their host. Thus, codon usage of a virus should coevolve with its host to efficiently and rapidly replicate. Some viruses can invade a broad spectrum of hosts (BSTVs), while others can invade a narrow spectrum only (NSTVs). Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts. We compare the patterns of codon usage in 255 virus genomes to test this hypothesis. Our results show that NSTVs have a higher degree of matching to their hosts' tRNA pools than BSTVs. Further, analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) infers that codon usage bias of NSTVs is relatively stronger than that of BSTVs. Thus, codon usage of NSTVs tends to better match their host than that of BSTVs. This supports the hypothesis that viruses adapt to the expression system of their host(s).","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0376d59ec946d885801cec22648d5c11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0a76761562838c943552f0e29355ca76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b56eb36556ef3a664a287343e5d81e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13fc843e97cecdbadf35a12995ebf23b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b45b86d7141f1df5708e1602303b72c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cec453759157f1d5d08fc1aefabf4f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ad5db2e560c9f361c18734c2e2db496, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9453c8336dc30aaf6f8e0fa445cacf1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97e4585ca9c26f6eb0d58d8843528f01, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9eb1d4b3242edf0ccb5e847e7d4ecf8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeba073048f0844689741b89c3cc3432, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b62190a71b1e392d5bb0db901caf7410, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c3b0733c83828b417b59433cfe78ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4f9d6ee887741f94c6644af52abba2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c50a6ce0b9429cdab8b604e1314af5a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cbd1a3dd2f3c607a0a2c56966a5bf03b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce45b16601d5193e233c82a70eb3a482, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d31713a3f2d08b94baff9595ed4fb8de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2c99946fe071b250b7e7273ef65b302, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b7fae1d6e02ac4915d015ae5ef28f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f5dc4b9c1a55fab4847bf359bd492c52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd8f8b0b84512a0a044e10c63aa3af15"

The test system was validated by studying the relative efficiencies of decontamination of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) and UV irradiation with droplets containing MS2 virus on filtering facepiece respirators. It was hypothesized that more potent decontamination treatments would result in corresponding larger decreases in the number of viable viruses recovered from the respirators. Sodium hypochlorite doses of 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter with a 10-min decontamination period resulted in approximately 3- to 4-log reductions in the level of MS2 coliphage. When higher sodium hypochlorite doses (≥8.25 mg/liter) were used with the same contact time that was used for the dilute solutions containing 2.75 to 5.50 mg/liter, all MS2 was inactivated. For UV decontamination at a wavelength of 254 nm, an approximately 3-log reduction in the level of MS2 virus was achieved with dose of 4.32 J/cm(2) (3 h of contact time with a UV intensity of 0.4 mW/cm(2)), while with higher doses of UV irradiation (≥7.20 J/cm(2); UV intensity, 0.4 mW/cm(2); contact times, ≥5 h), all MS2 was inactivated. These findings may lead to development of a standard method to test decontamination of respirators challenged by viral droplets.",""

The viral envelope serves several functions, including protecting the RNA or DNA molecule(s), evading recognition by the immune system, and facilitating virus entry. Despite these commonalities, viral envelopes come in a wide variety of shapes and configurations. The evolution of the viral envelope is made more puzzling by the fact that nonenveloped viruses are able to infect a diverse range of hosts across the tree of life. We reviewed the entry, transmission, and exit pathways of all (101) viral families on the 2013 International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) list. By doing this, we revealed a strong association between the lack of a viral envelope and the presence of a cell wall in the hosts these viruses infect. We were able to propose a new hypothesis for the existence of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, in which the latter represent an adaptation to cells surrounded by a cell wall, while the former are an adaptation to animal cells where cell walls are absent. In particular, cell walls inhibit viral entry and exit, as well as viral transport within an organism, all of which are critical waypoints for successful infection and spread. Finally, we discuss how this new model for the origin of the viral envelope impacts our overall understanding of virus evolution.",""

The first part addresses the many and not exclusive mechanisms leading to demyelination in the central nervous system. Although the hypothesis that a primary oligodendrocyte or myelin injury induces a secondary immune response in the central nervous system is still a matter of debate, most recent advances underline the influence of a primary immune response against myelin antigen(s), with a diversity of potential targets. Whereas multiple sclerosis was long considered as a T cell-mediated disease, the role of B lymphocytes is now increasingly recognized, and the influence of antibodies on tissue damage actively investigated. The second part of the review describes the axonal consequences of demyelination. Segmental demyelination results in conduction block or slowing of conduction through adaptative responses, notably related to modifications in the distribution of voltage gated sodium channels along the denuded axon. If demyelination persists, these changes, as well as the loss of trophic and metabolic support, will lead to irreversible axonal damage and loss. In this respect, favouring early myelin repair, during a window of time when axonal damage is still reversible, might pave the way for neuroprotection.",""

Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial “danger detector.” pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3–Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain. As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/032b9378ff3a63320b885d88f2c8134a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07c68120505bb568d1124b4459311b15, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cc447cbbea104972991ab3243469209, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1351177d51ae34db57f4dc223b258b07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13523173a64465e2b5380d15eb0337a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/163c47b62b70b825b6207304020887e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b2d3ce69e5cb8793a44fe941806aeda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43f4a8b58bb2939bac23bc886290c2f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5664b3ea4e5eed4e55978575f9986d67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/601a9157a1a74628c08ddb880374a658, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/60915add0c3a6439ab732bee211b3eea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/677255d575584f59451b95ba3cdde98c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69fd5ed646d27e711e77a872b7d491a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7166229b91d52f12a0265828386b146d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74703c9db3c7e77c5e47de13367bd8e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78a63da98473b992774442d35987c8ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7fe020959b452277903ccf393a01a480, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/959e877a9afb7f38ae29e77f079edbcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ba61a47413ce6a8eeb86476cd8ea01f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a2b9cd1226856ffa99b163892ccf09a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a518d713e01731276a8094d9e26d1094, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeef36232356fd09e59dc365d4c87f1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca3ec38ebf840cf6dd5cafa39a140c67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb1ec6b7e4fe5535cd01def109fef0e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d615fdf80579071cfb5bffbb13904902, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb6c52b474dc87a7c3477e9e8aa9d88d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa7d0ac1439fabc3bdad38e0751606c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fadc65f2a9027ca6744d143347a5f93a"

To understand how cellular conditions control capsid trafficking, we have tracked the subcellular fate of recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) vectors using confocal immunofluorescence, three-dimensional infection analysis, and subcellular fractionation. Here we report that a population of rAAV2 virions enters the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus after infection, whereas empty capsids are excluded from nuclear entry. Remarkably, after subcellular fractionation, virions accumulating in nucleoli were found to retain infectivity in secondary infections. Proteasome inhibitors known to enhance transduction were found to potentiate nucleolar accumulation. In contrast, hydroxyurea, which also increases transduction, mobilized virions into the nucleoplasm, suggesting that two separate pathways influence vector delivery in the nucleus. Using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, we then evaluated whether nucleolar proteins B23/nucleophosmin and nucleolin, previously shown to interact with AAV2 capsids, affect trafficking and transduction efficiency. Similar to effects observed with proteasome inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of nucleophosmin potentiated nucleolar accumulation and increased transduction 5- to 15-fold. Parallel to effects from hydroxyurea, knockdown of nucleolin mobilized capsids to the nucleoplasm and increased transduction 10- to 30-fold. Moreover, affecting both pathways simultaneously using drug and siRNA combinations was synergistic and increased transduction over 50-fold. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that rAAV2 virions enter the nucleus intact and can be sequestered in the nucleolus in stable form. Mobilization from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic sites likely permits uncoating and subsequent gene expression or genome degradation. In summary, with these studies we have refined our understanding of AAV2 trafficking dynamics and have identified cellular parameters that mobilize virions in the nucleus and significantly influence AAV infection.",""

Objectives This study investigated serum concentrations of IP-10 in healthy individuals who developed acute respiratory infection (ARI). The hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and detection of viral pathogens. Study design Data come from a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of mindfulness meditation or exercise on ARI (Clinical Trials ID: NCT01654289). Healthy adults ages 30–69 were followed for a single season for ARI incidence and severity. This trial is ongoing, and the investigators are still blinded. When a participant reported ARI symptoms, nasal swab and lavage for PCR-based viral identification and blood samples were collected within the first 72h of ARI symptoms. Serum IP-10 concentrations were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc., Quantikine ELISA, Minneapolis, MN). ARI severity was measured using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) until the ARI episode resolved. Results Serum IP-10 concentrations from 225 ARI episodes correlated with ARI global severity (rho 0.28 [95% CI: 0.15–0.39]; p <0.001). IP-10 concentrations were higher with an ARI in which a viral pathogen was detected compared to no viral pathogen detected (median 366pg/ml [IQR: 227–486] vs 163pg/ml [IQR: 127–295], p <0.0001). Influenza infections had higher IP-10 concentrations than coronavirus, enterovirus or rhinovirus, and paramyxovirus. Conclusion Serum IP-10 concentration correlates with ARI global severity. Also, IP-10 concentration measured early in the course of the ARI correlates with the daily severity, duration, and illness symptoms.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/066f59fa60a2607f97e17c66506032ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0770e96374f8b69c782f552382160c33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e21c77e048315301941112a0e8ae832, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e78aee1c62e2cb70031e3137c1d36c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ebb61964524b5d27b0f9ffde06397f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10d3ce01b04fce28a8dc501fa5784f67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15e523a9b8237cda38c4d29aab2234a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1816ed2efbadaa5554a4a7311f84ca25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bf60801ad3b301943b0ca7d94c65bcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1ec18c0f58d5f181df820b2e6e7c4750, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24d17f82119ca7eb9167697eafae909b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36331502aabad579972ce46039784690, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3db53d49a96f2e6698074632ee475de5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43401ae5ff30e656af5c912f1a590676, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b32fe816c77b329d151cac3c613fb0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5057d7faf3fe99cab4ebdb4038366370, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55147333a1e9b809495d9761421ec64d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5740b40420afcf1ccadf102ede8d6bdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e21603351ad253a6e62ce0e1b16b96a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e869aa48b00e5ac020eaead998bcb98, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6539bda3172958bc04980d8d5f0aef79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6789fa4bc51b5a4123f2107b865367ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68be19637ba95f69580ced64188ccf82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d7e61532946c10088cabeca0e57d71e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82534feae151e5b166489142e2166bf6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/826aacb4e30d1190f4a20b004846bca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/853a185cd1eb649d7759d09e922b17fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cbc6ad5b95eef34d9730c5e63ee56b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f0423050db8bed39827cc80f09d58be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fa4504874b011321aa8bc7cefe80aff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98b0316b820e7d710a17dace4b78bfab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a32cb77f000693c6652770774c321c6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a57ad3adf9e49be184dc26ddb09825d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd83da472a1ffcc1afb35ef412bfb8d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6d54898850db94f7de598137096021c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8398db6b799bbeb2b0ce09afd84e922, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9222f08338af7ca5c79ebd23761dc82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce3bd2832fecfbabd6f228980a69089a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d714bfd3357ae2ed174e679a7f5574c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df311ea64c5c22c03aa6f2ab71181e7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e301e0335184a6403c01123224400336, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb8bbbbb6ca656f15c0f987f0804a34b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f328570f34995caf8aedb9f4a67e3950, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc120a94c853a5f228b0d370f7592300"

In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8(+) T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1(+), Tim-3(+), CD122(+)). CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vβ chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vβ 14. Although Vβ8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vβ8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles. Our data demonstrate that IL-10-secreting CD8(+) T cells can arise during chronic Mtb infection, although the significance of this T cell population in tuberculosis pathogenesis remains unclear.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0255cd38f4dcc9024e47b88b8a7ad7e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05d76d3947d4c7edfa1db6cd06c1b162, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ae8d4b3a56c76dcb40eadfd45c11514, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/10393a08116e2c68e24b74eb4ab2644f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/126f0034ab1d81a67e7d77efd6a2f186, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1407c8d6a5682a7c0f303fd73b551ae1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1c7567241112d467eaa92c60c6c9e93d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d03a82d2738ae2326bc9c12115e13c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f49e25dfd054ff85264f332126bfd13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f4adc87bb131bd466dad35a61d153e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/461b295b23257a384c33c235ba57ece2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46e1b495e2c7a180a7799b4a1e4be3cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c58ea6bfcaed5d7cf8067963077c94c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b56cb5cc9a9ffd9d944edd024afb176, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6dec5c89e4d0834480c3ddc87eafad42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/707dc4dd0da83aa9a086bbb7d1af68b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70f28e60ed5cde7147da380cc89c4a0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73a09720c9e06495b1c2697c0f9ac634, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/781b44a34c25d179843e1db344ebb13c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8db67188e9d62e22f3f24eb9eaf10f0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93badec5cf6b2c08639f8a6c9dc83b34, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a5c071417287c32ae40f20a242a90f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeb836b60af7a357ccc1ab54bfdd1f0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b96e301c6440a05af8f8a932d1ec157b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc2de0b4c7cc551cf44f96d5f1dac29b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be6a1490a9f5ff96f2f6549328bb3ded, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c66f24c4a77ea83d7a2212f57a38ffe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb3bdf54105a013bc85d4bed2ad307e2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce5a53d00c2ea0c6fb29b0b135355bee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dcdcca4e907c2d08601351edb708bcae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e731f7e965c8ec8de92b033a7ef66ab8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e933df2dec24515072b89992b0128503, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8305fbd4ea906c4325f9a4a0d924201"

No randomised controlled trials involving acute exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis have been published to our knowledge. We hypothesised that azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. Methods We did this parallel-group, double-dummy, double-blind, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial in three Australian and one New Zealand hospital between April, 2012, and August, 2016. We enrolled children aged 1–19 years with radiographically proven bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. At the start of an exacerbation, children were randomly assigned to oral suspensions of either amoxicillin–clavulanate (22·5 mg/kg, twice daily) and placebo or azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) and placebo for 21 days. We used permuted block randomisation (stratified by age, site, and cause) with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was resolution of exacerbation (defined as a return to baseline) by 21 days in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of −20%. We assessed several secondary outcomes including duration of exacerbation, time to next exacerbation, laboratory, respiratory, and quality-of-life measurements, and microbiology. This trial was registered with the Australian/New Zealand Registry (ACTRN12612000010897). Findings We screened 604 children and enrolled 236. 179 children had an exacerbation and were assigned to treatment: 97 to amoxicillin–clavulanate, 82 to azithromycin). By day 21, 61 (84%) of 73 exacerbations had resolved in the azithromycin group versus 73 (84%) of 87 in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group. The risk difference showed non-inferiority (−0·3%, 95% CI −11·8 to 11·1). Exacerbations were significantly shorter in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group than in the azithromycin group (median 10 days [IQR 6–15] vs 14 days [8–16]; p=0·014). Adverse events were attributed to the trial medication in 17 (21%) of 82 children in the azithromycin group versus 23 (24%) of 97 in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group (relative risk 0·9, 95% CI 0·5 to 1·5). Interpretation By 21 days of treatment, azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin–clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with non-severe bronchiectasis. In some patients, such as those with penicillin hypersensitivity or those likely to have poor adherence, azithromycin provides another option for treating exacerbations, but must be balanced with risk of treatment failure (within a 20% margin), longer exacerbation duration, and the risk of inducing macrolide resistance.

Virus budding is a poorly understood process that challenges current models of vesicle formation. Here, a plausible mechanism for arenavirus budding is presented, building on recent evidence that viral proteins embed in the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane. Experimental results confirm that viral protein is associated with increased membrane curvature, whereas a mathematical model is used to show that localized increases in curvature alone are sufficient to generate viral buds. The magnitude of the protein-induced curvature is calculated from the size of the amphipathic region hypothetically removed from the inner membrane as a result of translation, with a change in membrane stiffness estimated from observed differences in virion deformation as a result of protein depletion. Numerical results are based on experimental data and estimates for three arenaviruses, but the mechanisms described are more broadly applicable. The hypothesized mechanism is shown to be sufficient to generate spontaneous budding that matches well both qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental observations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/159fc4801d5f42d3f9f05491f322c98f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/203d476a8cecd57e1915f73dd66aa156, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2296e1cc4f7c128d9086dfe4ac276d7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2551c63aa1efc9e44f9a85bd3965ce7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b5d84872bcc0fb2ad692407bbfe6c3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3400ce98c03eb07e52ae663ff14b162b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cf4c446f0126002db6999964f2ddf32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/408fea0cf1de4e59a949543cdb18f178, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/464e676881c3f7ad7bd8dc90022c72ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56b0256d3469e72dc9fe38ca5312e999, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58a8127d8084ff0a2c6a69392f0a3de2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c92429ca69c9990343f2315df78a893, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/702171ed941bf41d6e912c0dcecd783e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/726ecc2615fb0e51eceeb053e43af90d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89342e420493940ee0540bcaa7e7537c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac78330c263fe184c7ca48ef0a184ca9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd27782f3c2a14fcc5fea963be9fd61f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4e7a0383364b530cb54c34bf30cb278, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2caba096dbe6494451ea861f5e34546, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d56f8567969a811907e42f2203c7501a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd1339685d0f926b43b5252c3f3d2155, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecd11f14c0585a9c32d6875cb0b24144, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f6cf504df286e35e5d30ab446ba56ada, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb0cee3ecfcd4140bbcd82383ea88a25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd93656195979ea40b788303d0eef2dd"

The biophysical rationale is based on the limited penetration distance of 207-nm light in biological samples (e.g. stratum corneum) compared with that of 254-nm light. Here we extended our previous studies to 222-nm light and tested the hypothesis that there exists a narrow wavelength window in the far-UVC region, from around 200–222 nm, which is significantly harmful to bacteria, but without damaging cells in tissues. We used a krypton-chlorine (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp that produces 222-nm UV light with a bandpass filter to remove the lower- and higher-wavelength components. Relative to respective controls, we measured: 1. in vitro killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a function of UV fluence; 2. yields of the main UV-associated premutagenic DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) in a 3D human skin tissue model in vitro; 3. eight cellular and molecular skin damage endpoints in exposed hairless mice in vivo. Comparisons were made with results from a conventional 254-nm UV germicidal lamp used as positive control. We found that 222-nm light kills MRSA efficiently but, unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps (254 nm), it produces almost no premutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions in a 3D human skin model and it is not cytotoxic to exposed mammalian skin. As predicted by biophysical considerations and in agreement with our previous findings, far-UVC light in the range of 200–222 nm kills bacteria efficiently regardless of their drug-resistant proficiency, but without the skin damaging effects associated with conventional germicidal UV exposure.",""

Coyotes also are monestrous, and both sexes are fertile only in winter; thus, they depend upon social and physiologic synchrony for successful reproduction. To investigate the mutability of seasonal reproduction in coyotes, we attempted to evoke an out-of-season estrus in October using one of two short-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agents: (1) a GnRH analogue, deslorelin (6-d-tryptophan-9-(N-ethyl-l-prolinamide)-10-deglycinamide), 2.1mg pellet sc; or (2) gonadorelin, a GnRH (5-oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH2) porcine hypothalamic extract, 2.0μg/kg im once daily for 3 consecutive days. A transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (1 and 2 wk, respectively) was detected after treatment with deslorelin but not gonadorelin. Also, socio-sexual behaviors reminiscent of winter mating (including courtship, mate-guarding, precoital mounts, and copulatory ties) were observed among the deslorelin group. During the subsequent breeding season (January and February), however, preovulatory courtship behavior and olfactory sampling appeared suppressed; emergence of mounts and copulations were delayed in both deslorelin and gonadorelin treatment groups. Furthermore, whereas 8 of 12 females treated in October ovulated and produced healthy litters in the spring, 4 naïve coyotes failed to copulate or become pregnant. Thus, perturbation of hormones prior to ovulation in species with complex mating behaviors may disrupt critical intrapair relationships, even if fertility is not impaired physiologically.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1570cf52d31ea4ea26c19bea07f5f60f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1819a4b3806ec42669dfef8b13d3330f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1efe8f01517e0383408e2bc07720c5f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/224870c0c264c1b6b1645f8658754711, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a29bb3446700781a566bd0d267fd203, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3150d08b6732c34e46cc117006fa5941, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32d2bf3dbe4a0487239e1191ece0964b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39492f3dfbcfbcdeb660c3f145ae6d91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/509e9944fdb0a76330db2e85fb5ce1a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59845d5abc860128697c72cd1a45f363, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/609e703cae3a18aa8e63d0577556052a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f6c6acfdff1471cee87f89ff20db3d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/801431b2a624ff1a950bb89cf9021444, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82406c965249c2069b136be4f593e334, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/841665713d98f9fa5ddc384d910ab4d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/884d046125bcfcb7b99bab7c158c2116, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91b13599714af5e4e23778cbc6d23052, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98b4467e050911820032299ac1ac0dc0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9fff8ae118b5c33c61d994167ead082e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1c28c530b37993af53b34a695b646f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6b31b8da979f53b2c2c64bd00c91672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac99553067224cb0c8791dcea879dc88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2e1c566f4ee0dc725ebb4eb0602ecb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c078486dbef147f0baf50f89191d621d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce30afde7c9c7c6d237ad35226263e7e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4eb3838e14287bcd6d3be2f723cbd6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de3dc6a1b2b1745542f5a752d09f538a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e07d4ce1a44b83f00783b2d296fee3d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef035e801f430e6df7e887bcc032feab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f38578023c1399cb716a3c67ae20842d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f803e63c1b8407a3d92baeb71437f174, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa6f0e27f49a213e71511e5463737769"

Although some continuing educational societies aim to improve the level of general knowledge, published scientific facts are still rare, and there are many hypotheses or affirmations that remain unverified or even sometimes dogmatic or empirical. Taking some examples, this article reviews the main causes that may sometimes create difficulties for a veterinary practitioner faced with a dog or a cat suffering from reproductive problems. It could be difficult to orientate the diagnosis or the therapeutic approach, not knowing if what is found in the literature is a scientific certainty or just an unverified affirmation. This problem may result from the fact that there are still physiological processes that remain unclear, but also that some common beliefs are based on old studies that have not been repeated or verified, unverified affirmations, unclear nomenclature, clinical conditions which have not been standardized in the literature, clinical conditions mostly described through case reports, lack of studies on specific topics, areas of small animal reproduction that have been neglected by researchers, contradictory data or even studies that lack objectivity. The growing interest for research in Small Animal Reproduction will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/170382f27628f28a8def28c32ad5e333, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b295229d65a2e6ad645ad6bf2e0b214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27453d8553e578c560b47b0c94d52bb6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/316e9b713ea8d7af10c9aab4a710a46d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43b461d1c6997df8b80be5c845cf2ec8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/646166721008443254e46ee421c1582d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84efeab8a206705cb4f04907cec42916, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a78ff8953260b01fe0c7acef326640fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af34ba1121ca694ccaf02284b28b82dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5eb90e8cf5715b79c40b5f8fa0057ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf697d5df3153d558201ae3ea3a01b86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c70758aa755b030df30f6c04e03d0c3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c71f696dcb93347eed9e76c81bf2b8f8"

In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species. Information regarding host susceptibility to virus infection was collected to classify the cross-species infection propensity between hosts. Evolutionary divergence matrices and a sequence similarity scoring program were used to determine the distance and similarity of receptor sequences. The discriminant analysis was validated with cross-validation methods. The results showed that the primary structure of the receptor protein influences host susceptibility to cross-species viral infections. Pair-wise distance, relative distance, and sequence similarity showed the best accuracy in identifying the susceptible group. Based on the results of the discriminant analysis, we constructed ViCIPR (http://lcbb3.snu.ac.kr/ViCIPR/home.jsp), a server-based tool to enable users to easily extract the cross-species infection propensities of specific viruses using a simple two-step procedure. Our sequence-based approach suggests that it may be possible to identify virus transmission between hosts without requiring complex structural analysis. Due to a lack of available data, this method is limited to viruses whose receptor use has been determined. However, the significant accuracy of predictive variables that positively and negatively influence virus transmission suggests that this approach could be improved with further analysis of receptor sequences.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12d8b70c4e0e443692939320beb932ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16a15a82d992a4deeb6df625c9d1dd22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d369574f7d4a16f04aeb1f1bc4d49eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44d3d912b5f09b36a4831d4fdf1d9b1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bd28ce2f59215488bb16630a43e7a05, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5bb2332af6aee7af702bcce3453cc482, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63d619723f0ae88fb23eeb20fdc608fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70c21de80b36923bdd5e181e3e225a08, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72671df8f50aeb5a2d614c3e26b92c86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/762514591cf0fb661179ee4f01a2d600, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c638dad7565d7a8d76855b657332f19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/90c8267410dc63fc66950d609f7c9c46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94abc190c7b119e85d73e3372fac8395, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94f814d03fb61ac929c19375d6dbf683, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96075d0430c8b70d9ce8151fdf5e17c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9db4d6b481ba84a28d712107246a6f24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a20c42f45e459e031e0378286e538436, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b70c47f3e16fdf1f0803a8f1dc2a8e67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8c29cc468dbf789eec577646098b4ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3b94814bba0e0d8e586683fc2b83140, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d2e5267bb5b7ab36ecbe4c0815e23f5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d303df0ce12a9f2ac8eeb2ed246638cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ecbd2bd87fd4ff17c1cabdc20bccbdcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f00d2c215f0daf75345de57d4a548114, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f05b9a47823b35c6057e4cce5011616c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffce32e4246eb2a8c5089cb57823cb31"

The location and properties of the FPs in the spike (S) glycoproteins of different coronaviruses (CoV) have not yet been determined. Through amino acid sequence analysis of S proteins of representative CoVs, we identified a common region as a possible FP (pFP) that shares the characteristics of FPs of class I viral fusion proteins, including high Ala/Gly content, intermediate hydrophobicity, and few charged residues. To test the hypothesis that this region contains the CoV FP, we systemically mutated every residue in the pFP of Middle East respiratory syndrome betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) and found that 11 of the 22 residues in the pFP (from G953 to L964, except for A956) were essential for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. The synthetic MERS-CoV pFP core peptide ((955)IAGVGWTAGL(964)) induced extensive fusion of liposome membranes, while mutant peptide failed to induce any lipid mixing. We also selectively mutated residues in pFPs of two other β-CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Although the amino acid sequences of these two pFPs differed significantly from that of MERS-CoV and each other, most of the pFP mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV also failed to mediate membrane fusion, suggesting that these pFPs are also the functional FPs. Thus, the FPs of 3 different lineages of β-CoVs are conserved in location within the S glycoproteins and in their functions, although their amino acid sequences have diverged significantly during CoV evolution. IMPORTANCE Within the class I viral fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses, the FP is the critical mediator of fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes leading to virus infection. FPs from within a virus family, like influenza viruses or human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), tend to share high amino acid sequence identity. In this study, we determined the location and amino acid sequences of the FPs of S glycoproteins of 3 β-CoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MHV, and demonstrated that they were essential for mediating cell-cell fusion and virus entry. Interestingly, in marked contrast to the FPs of influenza and HIV, the primary amino acid sequences of the FPs of β-CoVs in 3 different lineages differed significantly. Thus, during evolution the FPs of β-CoVs have diverged significantly in their primary sequences while maintaining the same essential biological functions. Our findings identify a potential new target for development of drugs against CoVs.",""

The main reason may be that not all cell death pathways induced by AIV were blocked by the current therapies. In this review, drugs for AIV and associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are summarized. The roles of antioxidant (vitamin C) and multiple immunomodulators (such as Celecoxib, Mesalazine and Eritoran) are discussed. The clinical care of ARDS may result in ischemia reperfusion injury to poorly ventilated alveolar cells. Cyclosporin A should effectively inhibit this kind of damages and, therefore, may be the key drug for the survival of patients with virus-induced ARDS. Treatment with protease inhibitor Ulinastatin could also protect lysosome integrity after the infection. Through these analyses, a large drug combination is proposed, which may hypothetically greatly reduce the mortality rate.",""

PRRS was recognized in 1987 and within a few years became pandemic causing an estimated yearly $600,000 economic loss in the USA with comparative losses in most other countries. The causative agent is a single-stranded, positive-sense enveloped arterivirus (PRRSV) that infects macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Despite the discovery of PRRSV in 1991 and the publication of >2,000 articles, the control of PRRS is problematic. Despite the large volume of literature on this disease, the cellular and molecular mechanisms describing how PRRSV dysregulates the host immune system are poorly understood. We know that PRRSV suppresses innate immunity and causes abnormal B cell proliferation and repertoire development, often lymphopenia and thymic atrophy. The PRRSV genome is highly diverse, rapidly evolving but amenable to the generation of many mutants and chimeric viruses for experimental studies. PRRSV only replicates in swine which adds to the experimental difficulty since no inbred well-defined animal models are available. In this article, we summarize current knowledge and apply it toward developing a series of provocative and testable hypotheses to explain how PRRSV immunomodulates the porcine immune system with the goal of adding new perspectives on this disease.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03fd3c5d06d23421009c14864590e117, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1906246e4f2bfe6df86024a76a6d18a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/288227f17e8dd9dbf9a588b7de0c85ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a7cf2a75fc5bf83cd91f59f2b1d1600, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3231e4e205f38e316b74ed9f76d3d092, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b1f50122879b2f6f0c1f256159b7559, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45d52dcc3ea84b8a087a98d27c142d82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f069378fc578bdefdf594a0aac9a373, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/514b1db5717b36169e8a88d1b9957754, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f3457f3e063362efb1bbd81c9e47b51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/649a9f993fa69528f05e5726f1af89d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f3bf3c1116c8e62d033325c686dd75c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71786d37d7c0ae4074607c30854c791d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75c2583c537d99be19557670f99b6f38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78665acef55ed8e31223fcd5d785c1d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/86ba11bb4809b14c09f5fc1dc219d655, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88730f64d6534f1471180b167cdd709a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bfd5d419fca870376d43a18c41841b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8f09b61b314f626fb88bcb9717a099dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a74e01603e6d7627b19372f3c42b1d83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b99105eae5a4967b10688c3bedad030c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5e7fc51690ae5302eaa2dc568f62dce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e471b3cc0fd90ad8954fc6ac6cc413c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea9e27bba98d9ea009164c7508b62f20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1d045f9336763f7c3b542e002650182, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1ef01522603a12a72353ed3a33fb42f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f463818323807b9cff4df042b8440077, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f62e122368cdb1ed99c293d9ad939d4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f933e843bf3c17634c6040d8d900be16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff27a3bef431b83ce6253472907e7817"

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002–2003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN−) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN− CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN− population as compared to ExoN+. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01d4ebdcfb385ae04e42724f40bef950, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02e73e204e82a19b41fc5d1bc34f1027, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e021f93ae97411b43ccda6af511e2d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1841e1a12ba79d96bd59d274ff844f25, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1edebe1f0244d4f0b1e1b36c423f9827, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d197a167847cab1e0c86c8126bdcb6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32dfc3f2f3f9fbfb1671be33ac7f266e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3474d42539a630652dbdf9e55d5434a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/399354dae2ec793b35702ce48782dc24, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/429151b953f48500145385f389161d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4700e8c1d40a0b4067491a278ff2b222, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47f16555fb94d36e68ddb81e7203fe46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c7853b5ea4a87466d32565b5084b47a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5423c3f900be9667d01b3ddbd08117d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56706b85291c4b2863ecedbcbc52e054, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ae8d3c43fe407820b44b096a4f2962d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b3cf24eb7a67ffafcc9179763569ec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c276fd2210f2d9221185591687366f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cb678c3e67f8db475c504fdc896ed63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fca5e777d11210292a7d6601770d4ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6478134682e0e4fe7592c22e2d59afa3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6aa3083481d687ddf33d032b14150927, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d6824a48f2d4b1f37121d64013a706d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f57971519d2ae6dc0040d33c1751a5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f92ff657e69aeb3621f63867f6fdee6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72fe7c27ff65e4ea38e2cd99d9175c56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75218a433dd9c953688459cc9d2f4227, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81854c427998dccaa3f6e5edef573d48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8808c8957ad4ca4dd876020536e62d63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ba31c71d0b42727273e95f34a8c86c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a157797fd5b21ef721ef266329538561, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5da52c44437c90125f206dcba84cbe6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acc7706e0161a272c0d6ed1254325a8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b464d8372ffaf307425447ba63c9cce0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5b0859f4df4372dbe7ead5b85c57cd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd6a8c7bc3d4b5420b56964527828036, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3824418fe00d026251b742c30c3ba92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dee302787826b29387660464da77b46e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e062d0537ca1fb34bf5d71a583aa7bab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3765cb238de101ee7ae3315c65e7ad2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e760de3cd6ae4e766e74fadc99c289f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f996f25a77e613e2fe88bfc098ef3a7c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb8279b0e0081f965df0d8aa55470842"

We hypothesized that axonal damage recruits inflammatory cells to sites of Wallerian degeneration, leading to demyelination. Three weeks after TMEV infection, axonal degeneration was induced in the posterior funiculus of mice by injecting the toxic lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) I into the sciatic nerve. Neuropathology was examined 1 week after lectin injection. Control mice, infected with TMEV but receiving no RCA I, had inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the anterior/lateral funiculi. Other control mice that received RCA I alone did not develop inflammatory lesions. In contrast, RCA I injection into TMEV-infected mice induced lesions in the posterior funiculus in addition to the anterior/lateral funiculi. We found no differences in lymphoproliferative responses or antibody titers against TMEV among the groups. This suggests that axonal degeneration contributes to the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the central nervous system by altering the local microenvironment. In this scenario, lesions develop from the axon (inside) to the myelin (outside) (Inside-Out model).",""

Nasopharyngeal samples from 300 patients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were tested by qPCR for the NSP1 and NP-1 genes. The VP1/2 gene in positive samples was then amplified by PCR and sequenced. A total of 49 positive HBoV cases (16.3%; mean Ct value of 34.41) were detected with the mean age being 18.1 months (range 1 month to 5 years) and the median age being 1 year of age. Children aged between 0 and 12 months had higher detection rates of HBoV (69.4%; 34/49; mean Ct = 34.45) than children from other age groups (30.6%; 15/49; mean Ct = 34.34). No significant differences were observed between HBoV Ct levels and clinical illness. The occurrence was more frequently associated with fall (38.8%; 19/49) and spring (36.7%; 18/49). All 12 sequenced isolates were identified as HBoV-1, displaying minor genetic variation compared to the Swedish reference strains ST1 and ST2 (99.1–99.7% nt). The sole identification of HBoV-1 supports the hypothesis that this particular genotype is strongly related to ARI, and contributes to the role of this virus in the aetiology of respiratory diseases.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f156b65e3bb3c07e71dcd30c61dc73e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/11b75fc3a54b2383ec35510ef4e3d5b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/149c9353bc145ab92e75844184780303, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2616663647a2adde6d049c4cba5bc08b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30496cdf22e6042e6301bd9957efaeb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52e6d00c7501623a3d14edaede5a12ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/593cc6ad76ef9e42f6353570c0b16f68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c88c89c8cfa69737a1c7e0db42a60a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69bbdae2c43ed58545ad7e7494ca7df3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76fa6a71dfe064fc522a67b67ccbb440, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7735e29f24a3e17a9a5a777a072daea4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/802eaf9522b154a903d2abb5ec76eedd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bc9a73e1ddc93e429e4d5d19affdcfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cf972057fd89efd365ab1246c3c7b1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9805cb7e40640ef233a4fe5237f8272f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae6e50891a7d20221341d77f5bb2c8bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7f72265a722fae46a2e865af086408d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc7b55fe5437491279a3b5f82b86f254, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cad0df2619b7c5b282f35adff43fdb41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fff89726d0faeccc150cfd8077c881c1"

The World Health Organization, WHO, announced that millions of cases of ZIKV are likely to occur in the USA in the near future. This situation has created an alarming public health emergency of international concern requiring the detection of this life-threatening viral candidate due to increased cases of newborn microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection. Hence, this review reports possible methods and strategies for the fast and reliable detection of ZIKV with particular emphasis on current updates, knowledge, and new hypotheses that might be helpful for medical professionals in poor and developing countries that urgently need to address this problem. In particular, we emphasize liposome-based biosensors. Although these biosensors are currently among the less popular tools for human disease detection, they have become useful tools for the screening and detection of pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses because of their versatile advantageous features compared to other sensing devices. This review summarizes the currently available methods employed for the rapid detection of ZIKV and suggests an innovative approach involving the application of a liposome-based hypothesis for the development of new strategies for ZIKV detection and their use as effective biomedicinal tools.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/011fe8588df0333e9032622b3834b7c2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/074c4662081c624806ff9571b98c23b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b549ab6267f70200c88b1703cabbef8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2acb034bf2d2745730b7e23db83a1b64, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d211d2f5bcaeffb734e7930a15a8cf3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/350446d90fc29ca5d85475503f71e9ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36d71e32a95222e09820c3b439de3c92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f9f6719a8be0c8b556326433b1ae07e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ea09062495ee1abf62994c08a99fa78, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/511297fe9a4cbb14869fd313347e6c9d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/540f5d9df68da293e587272d4d4e09c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a0b3b50308e900a225d07a063c5fca8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/648661dd2fada03c1a38cba179b65e23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78eba6b5e047c35b6c8510d3b1d3e47f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96780f3ede324690ca732c70f823e84b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a84bc84eed435cd9ab950d0984b67668, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b38994c6d57458783a3374ad7831df68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c640f13957aa9ec08415fc0511d0c3d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cba0dfa2692870aed2caa7c0a23c789f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d46d76d4b6442a535580d37b28fc5869, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8277b359bdad566d457697ee68faab1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dee15ed1f004d37ab301f4736e250245, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb2a6692e64a580af7b0b26aff84a567, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eef0154040d2924bad9aecc0cb4580ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef56379f73690d400007e287d18a291c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f675dd2e71232ce9fd06f5c39f8ed387, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb2c0dd4ad341e821da487a4bea5d420"

Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs. We have further hypothesized that the immunogenicity of highly conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) may be reduced or eliminated by their very weak or absent interactions with germline antibodies and immune responses leading to the elicitation of bnAbs may not be initiated and/or sustained. Even if such responses are initiated, the maturation pathways are so extraordinarily complex that prolonged periods of time may be required for elicitation of bnAbs with defined unique sequences. We provided the initial evidence supporting this antibody germline/maturation hypothesis, which prompted a number of studies to design vaccine immunogens that could bind putative germline predecessors of known bnAbs and to explore complex B cell lineages. However, guiding the immune system through the exceptionally complex antibody maturation pathways to elicit known bnAbs remains a major challenge. Here, we discuss studies exploring the antibody germline/maturation hypothesis as related to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 and present our recent data demonstrating the existence of germline-like precursors of VRC01 antibodies in a human cord blood IgM library.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f239647ae724575565369386b745ed7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15b81fa78115f87f952142a176272147, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1a4b8b556cc273731192bba5644e620c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d683b8da3d51804fa6463542716a65b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24031e3a3ced2380cca5798997e25b88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28d2c82eafbacc9190d484b04959f501, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bbfbd29479609bdfbf6880e4e57a7e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44a14c1676094b2e96a77db85b886296, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5109af3a86d153429fe234bc2b71e924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58049d53ecc4ef62e2129aea990a3e9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/612748ea03f11cdc010606c2f918652a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ab7f8938fdbc8635e20df68ec8ac43f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d890ef205d67216a06c32fd89730e19, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/75866829566dd939b665a120553a6264, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79df9167370951eba4d55099b31c47cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82f77055a4ff1c87a17188eaf977b800, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/876e0b43f2d6255fafa830c01a3d23b6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dda3311812ee8e6269475df77160123, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fb1960e47acb4cd5eb43fde5acdb256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dd825fcd1ecbd065ec39790888f9f23, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a065ae3417ad474e66fb5a524e6e1ba2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a602738bd1e9cf56a565d90dba016ddf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9950a953e3dc41d4d5600b395daa316, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd3b994dd22a9044d0fc854d939134c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be2080fbcac07e936ff8b9a12dafd062, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7550e59da5ca41783287d8bff58ee2c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df8e46cb22df826ceea9b6ddd7b544dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e533dca23957a28841e5277f3fbe9c8c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef85f27e9be0c661b27572d56993b0a7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f14b8590d5ee79e3a75b89db8771e57d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f739128769a8186b318b6851514c1558, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8bc5d9894e03f605fc350d438b622e0"

Significant intrinsic genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic variations were observed between the two strains involving genes of diverse functions. We identified 16 strain-specific regions in the B. pseudomallei K96243 reference genome, and for eight regions their differential presence could be ascribed to either DNA acquisition or loss. A remarkable 43% of the transcriptional differences between the strains could be attributed to genes that were differentially present between K96243 and Bp15682, demonstrating the importance of lateral gene transfer or gene loss events in contributing to pathogen diversity at the gene expression level. Proteins expressed in a strain-specific manner were similarly correlated at the gene expression level, but up to 38% of the global proteomic variation between strains comprised proteins expressed in both strains but associated with strain-specific protein isoforms.

Failure to detect these strains also presents a public health problem. The laboratory methods used in detecting lactose-fermenting Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium from six outbreaks of salmonellosis in veal calves are described. Each outbreak was caused by a multiply-resistant and lactose-fermenting strain of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium. The use of Levine eosin-methylene blue agar in combination with screening of suspect colonies for C8 esterase enzyme and inoculation of colonies into sulfide-indole-motility medium for hydrogen sulfide production was particularly effective for their detection. A hypothesis for the creation of lactose-fermenting salmonellae in the environment is presented. It is proposed that the environment and husbandry practices of veal-raising barns provide a unique niche in which lactose-fermenting salmonellae may arise.",""

In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses. DISCUSSION: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days. During winter viral season, more than 14,000 surveillance surveys were carried out resulting in 2,103 respiratory illness visits on 1189 infants. First year follow-up has been completed on over 95% percent of participants from the first year of enrollment. With ongoing follow-up for wheezing and childhood asthma outcomes, the INSPIRE study will advance our understanding of the complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/050673ecf75381fa4360a41be3f76af5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/192fe601a1bdb9f99895cab6d9898535, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1fec07ee6b9cf9c45a7dc2f5edd8b338, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20e6e31d47ac71f5a93c38d864c6f6b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f6d1a18b989c38eb61d9bf12d09b227, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/39d6be219b0e540012a6d8ac85ebb67e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42b2cb052201d37841d15b7f1960670a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54b8ff1568d2681d951a2d71d4e312e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59ff1303273ff953c38ebe4d88704b6f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6af7d50f4ded9d13f023a747749c38c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7664b7601020a6c901eea6269027f979, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89bbfd330b931864c35749eea2c96caa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5a4d8140bf717d832742032d8cf5f79, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b8fd375e99865406796ab7b744266db7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc9878a2b27499f829b595d88aab2072, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4dbc4cac9e89792a381115bb584620c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dae7badbb6c0719c9258b96f91474943, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e28ef7dd2e664b0c8070fb46199fa97c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3fd02fdca7bbc35b10acfa6648cd8d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb3acc0441187c8f5737cf3ea68d4c4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3daea7c46c2648fb4dfcf2b58512c36"

In-host genetic diversity could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures such as host-switching events. Multiple new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples just within the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emergent human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of nearly 950×(454 sequencing) and 38,000×(Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the unpassaged samples and could quickly shift to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert coded for three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells, and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were “selected” from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01702d3cb3882742d47cbdd14a269284, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0173b513ca67e4b74bc43f3781d1355a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/159f411862600c34ea90278cde2c098d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b39f3a4874a32ebf1fc874dac0a5d4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3afa0c660b356538d984250187d19f60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fa0bcff315e175ac8d019540a5b6257, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4170bf4cd304f793e8b56724d23786f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4296d654a422218e7e82d5d5db1f9b4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/447bde5fb0bc364c2a54f19673b29aa8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48578ce064c7c18b195516c03172ae6a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a290b5506d5e7e52e6cc885a115104c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f0aee0bbd4014e8c0baf74a29d2f70b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50b6c033d7af38683dbf624d0f09c385, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58212764c62b9ca0b94d2ae506bad129, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69f7e92330d31bfbd835f8e9bb6f98f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/789246e4ad3b0c57f98abedb56f90330, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8202213ab89d0d78d1511ecec3f8268f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/84bc8d7d7a9d2f601894123980e6d182, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/897f31bf7d3ea3a465a99d63b78f37d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8c9760b8cb44671a95c49a93b2d4dae6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8caa38016593e1baceed552137c219ec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ac29b70a32e2bbe00869d8cb95f1d44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9bba4a5ce1481b8d082ea3755529a4c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ee1d599ad0e2965c7855e0817f878d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a69288bbe4768322d882605d08c91516, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae7cbe67676a7f0552a68cc0cf114a32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b36d797656fb615c5c0f6e3b10f6e287, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbdfa03b8b30aa9c3f79aac49179efdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0525c20364f53b669348fc2a573d78c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29b4637b649b10386efccafed2e03c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c4df1d9b8982e92a6ddc64296f5bdb51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/caa667af9f8621dd5549470571c6f924, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cef94f5cc24f38442310b0adb7233e18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d1e8c862692db6ddefbf689e7624ec45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d21e50fe556dda33901d22ea17d3ea74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d54587a9d64d368a5656ddc3f1181cd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e2730ca16b349abaa429e4eaac6166ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6638c1942b7d4a45e96c0ec3c415d45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2921489c0c0df9fbce9bc1d48406f33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f847d91e3d39e99e7fcbb4542a02d09b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc9e7578017c662be6e23440161aae5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fdaba1ae89526efbc2381599533b6b53"

A high prevalence of parvovirus DNA (63%) was detected among all surveyed species, particularly in mongooses (58%) and red foxes (79%), along with the presence of CPV/FPLV circulating antibodies that were identified in 90% of a subset of parvovirus-DNA positive samples. Most specimens were extensively autolysed, restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation. Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR possibly correspond to viral DNA reminiscent from previous infections. The molecular characterization of viruses, based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene, allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red fox’s as feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and one stone marten’s as newCPV-2b type. The genetic similarity found between the FPLV viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in Portugal and publicly available comparable sequences, suggests a closer genetic relatedness among FPLV circulating in Portugal. Although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established, this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread, potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species, such as the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus).","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0606d197ed130a03b601391102dddb10, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0739e5f871a09263ade1ffca7bcdea47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c5bab3eb4d33517928345c3c7355692, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ec924e1187e6ba7b31fce0e185b3dc9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f03b2d2690919dde48b5370ef7c2368, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1592fc4fab2f37cfda1406ca6e81ecc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20af99e5951f4db7b9054489ce659464, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e8c3914912983a62943acab49e17b37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36cf761d6accba195f11eaf14d4d8a2f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/379b32c15de38f110953c35405908370, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3918fdf8e63acfaaec456753d5075aaf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bcddf05cac6054d17244c91323479cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40176d93a4c765d92d44dcfc4023bbe3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49aaba26537e6c76619ab8f342c37cdd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4bcb06fdc95120b6f448fdf5fbea0e66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d6bf4f109cc0eedf18eee863a9efa76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b29e124ce98ac2fdc184602b25834d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c7ea50e277c0bbcc38624b0ba64e48d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6728f33ad2add2eeb8a7e57fb1ef82b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69c5100c6cad5226702237356b9ae52c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f4f24c7774054e5db64175ff46aebd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cd13a7a78c79d07d3ef19afd4464f09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/833ba2e7030f7dbe8d2d0eefa9de698d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/846d28fe5de4c53da46d4c88a10455ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8572b74e8c256974d3aa4a1c5769d055, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88140682c5aa1058c181e0ca5ae8e03c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8837311804bb2888d080b354615132c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/899895adc8ce15a6c52966931d341e22, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8ad3348b1512e716a9f197fcf1e6dc50, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8badf8fa4dfd62b352cbf114dd79ebcf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1f963bc50bcb27afefd6cfc0cf3f819, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aadc704b7db01bea3e44c82b4dfbcddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af994517340577962a51b4ab3195d871, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4b2fcb18761426b8d64ff2e501c2803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b575723d1a0466497de2e2a945d6c651, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bccc3dbd926e8263f1cb5bd56a469516, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd090019b5df4ef69df39a05da17dfe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c36cfdc7771317b76258a086a2caff1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c8a99436a0a652e2f4695930dbdd7ba1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c96ed260342a21fbc80e8fc364199455, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccc5b1f21acf65b9703fa45424173952, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d04ca05c83c5ce07f30cb0cd0c6c3461, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5204e728818cc0c15a0474013c851a6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d58d8f9b6ff380dd514e77d26f634cfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5aa336cd6a40ee63d51051b032d2f5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbfa135990538c3c9a22814a84eea489, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de46a4547a64e3cfa0dd2f78b5bd5422, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e47f7455bb15c55d4b4087eb18ed29a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e492a82c315109b7b65bfed701ef71b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f052c25e5765098ffb1700d7c40581b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7d95a7015fcda57e82aba11b0c8326d"

A real-time reverse transcription PCR, targeting 2 alternatively spliced mRNAs, was developed. HBoV1 mRNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 33 (25%) of 133 children with RTIs but in none of 28 controls (p<0.001). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the test were good. Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 may cause RTIs, and we propose that HBoV1 mRNA could be used with benefit, instead of HBoV1 DNA, as a diagnostic target.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/28d4edd1503471b9e247fc49434e5dae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ded6a41c348a54d1756719d8fa170e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3aaab93d48bbabf0a579209c26ade88a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52a54e40993b2f5b9e3afdefac3001f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6cfbb64549953a08d18c5a45a5e24d0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72fba16505d9b3b4fba579c9f64f1193, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7be0459f8866bf61aebe666d30012efe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b3cfb42dc43ffa8fc35c5dbce4f8d36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ea0c9b48dc293fb48c91f09e28617a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0e64e5dc722b99ee527f618c4f8cfbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6f219a58107363511e93d54aad385f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efdb4d24798e7103c733d5a637187bed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe843cc8d234e45c9d6c1096fab7f696"

The association of host genetics with susceptibility to and severity of clinical symptoms in acute Q fever was investigated. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNG (rs2430561/rs1861493), STAT1 (rs1914408), and VDR (rs2228570) genes were determined in 85 patients from the 2007 Dutch acute Q fever outbreak, and a symptom score was calculated. IFNG rs1861493 showed a significant association with the symptom score; IFNG rs2430561 showed a similar trend. These SNPs were then used to reproduce results in a 2009 outbreak population (n = 123). The median symptom score differed significantly in both populations: 2 versus 7. The significant association of IFNG rs1861493 with symptom score in the first population was not reproduced in the second population. We hypothesize that individuals in the second outbreak were exposed to a higher Coxiella burnetii dose compared to the first, which overruled the protection conferred by the A-allele of IFNG rs1861493 in the first population.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/20a18ff72f8fc87ce4b6f2dc4751e25a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24b89566f405779508ea207554cddd3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34ffb8b17238f575a30dca7668edd717, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/531cb6cadb05fbb92bf7fb43393fb820, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/623bb13cc779b38ddb731fdd65f8e281, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6287c2d6b5771b08e9c2558061bbab43, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63d13218ba0c9f480d7ea266baaa025e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70401662a9cb7476a37d84abfd2a1cf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78e796c658bd90c1845f4ff611e5dcda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8719a3492ba8526df9ae6586ec79b39e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a60c32e38b9123c656cbbd20e8a88f12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7f519b6bc11b4592664e3f4f2015b5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf25d40d93bbcaab916dd7f572f7ceec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c321463c2e705d44ed1b51456922dd90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc30e4216f2da79ff3a986a80bf4e80d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d98c4fdf80177fd4f393d59929218fe9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc1aee3e37a453998834e3376a290086"

We aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and IPD in Ontario, Canada, using several complementary methodological tools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated a total number of 38,501 positive influenza tests in Central Ontario and 6,191 episodes of IPD in the Toronto/Peel area, Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 1995 and 3 October 2009, reported through population-based surveillance. We assessed the relationship between the seasonal wave forms for influenza and IPD using fast Fourier transforms in order to examine the relationship between these two pathogens over yearly timescales. We also used three complementary statistical methods (time-series methods, negative binomial regression, and case-crossover methods) to evaluate the short-term effect of influenza dynamics on pneumococcal risk. Annual periodicity with wintertime peaks could be demonstrated for IPD, whereas periodicity for influenza was less regular. As for long-term effects, phase and amplitude terms of pneumococcal and influenza seasonal sine waves were not correlated and meta-analysis confirmed significant heterogeneity of influenza, but not pneumococcal phase terms. In contrast, influenza was shown to Granger-cause pneumococcal disease. A short-term association between IPD and influenza could be demonstrated for 1-week lags in both case-crossover (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.10 [1.02–1.18]) and negative binomial regression analysis (incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.09 [1.05–1.14]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that influenza influences bacterial disease incidence by enhancing short-term risk of invasion in colonized individuals. The absence of correlation between seasonal waveforms, on the other hand, suggests that bacterial disease transmission is affected to a lesser extent.

This issue has received more and more attentions from academics. This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission. METHODS: The Eulerian–Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The dose–response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants. The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions. An in-flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation. A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors. A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system. RESULTS: The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols, significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin. The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered. The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers. CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important. For future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control.

Cells were exposed to 18α-GA at various concentrations for various time periods and were harvested for flow cytometry total viable cell and apoptotic cell death measurements. Cells treated with 18α-GA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 100 μM at 48 h. The cell growth inhibition resulted in induction of apoptosis and decreased the mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) and increased caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities. Furthermore, cytochrome c and AIF were released from mitochondria, as shown by western blotting and confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. Western blotting showed that 18α-GA increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid and decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, furthermore, results also showed that 18α-GA increased Fas and Fas-L which are associated with surface death receptor in HL-60 cells. Based on those observations, the present study supports the hypothesis that 18α-GA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells involves the activation of the both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01b28bf963aeadffc7590fa46920ec7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03dea30d540dc1ad779881eab462b4df, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07aedbc8a7d8c58d374b6eb7ce9e14ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16340101af9e6a8f36b8567eadc81ed0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16d5d25edee254a9d9bb81c094fa7e3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b881eaa7b3cad69b138b571e75cced0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb5f8e4d940fbe005d9bbdf95ce32c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2096f90b7e87d30806bf8e254a21f15b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29b4c88a667be52f2090dc1984251784, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c5311a679ab53488461bb32e368d9c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/479e2b2cdf27c6a45fa88abc2045b093, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cd5c3fd6b5a0e692be73e9e5e43b433, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/52be557d9c7c1f480f11799ef22296b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/540365eb25a196d11a1c9f31a64602de, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e7fa7620847f68e30569d22ef02bd8e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79539cf1db8e462056cd114d791fa2cf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ab830d4e4b603d228eea43d00202efc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7de4e3ad4a7edfcd1d319e3bdaffece1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81dcebe4c9e33741c51f09fbb3c6b3ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8754d5a5e99bfa14620db06dc59fda27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e0e296f8405d5676136aecd44ebc3ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a27cb8111f530ae67536fcbe77647c1f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5a06f7ccb73d3c662a3d3593650c667, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6f8ccd7b4d7b2f73a7afc995f76ea4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a71b1bcaae5ba73ab49ae1665a2b4a28, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b54fd1dfb69e753ef9ade0313eff1f00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2ef65cb9a2aebae2b196e1bbbaf4272, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ced97d7c37d697de2a1a3933e52ef37d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d07dd5c16cd51c5be40d132f987a51c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d150beaee754a37fb2000b5873061911, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d161fd796b2975bf9001f5d44873fd13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d314161c54dfe090b9096c08d1990e70, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e751be949a72706ed5494dbc07524ce8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1dc57260dfd5f72a62a78fa8961b4da"

Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01af1b063c53c8f484dc7d25353eec4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/143bfcc99692f09059776daf3074bbb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2520783ca1f98a1d92ba6569e856e600, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/486b5e06fc186de13064cd359865168b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e3ae965fb4ee63d855fb1049d1d4d68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62260113f97b575d6616a7e480d08b5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68dce01a91851fdf382f94cb2761155a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7794276ce0f38f70b84f9e5f1926e0d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78e95b2fd9dbcbb654f22454b1cc133d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a4037e265b193ef8c74c160217d66ab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b58ae5ab09abdfa7985e34d67fa5e56, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95df1c6f86df23a48532d64fb7a0ad44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a87a971da16e5559d721d417d4925b83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acd231160988544190e40870fa661de0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b44dd70f3e91b62d6fe5fa1c01ddd9b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9236e099e509ed3181364148aaa6e44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/faa5fcf92ad556556288eab9209676ad"

The increasing norovirus diversity is currently categorized into at least 10 genogroups which are further classified into more than 40 genotypes. In addition to humans, norovirus can infect a broad range of hosts including livestock, pets, and wild animals, e.g., marine mammals and bats. Little is known about norovirus infections in most non-human hosts, but the close genetic relatedness between some animal and human noroviruses coupled with lack of understanding where newly appearing human norovirus genotypes and variants are emerging from has led to the hypothesis that norovirus may not be host restricted and might be able to jump the species barrier. We have systematically reviewed the literature to describe the diversity, prevalence, and geographic distribution of noroviruses found in animals, and the pathology associated with infection. We further discuss the evidence that exists for or against interspecies transmission including surveillance data and data from in vitro and in vivo experiments.",""

Picornaviruses are simple models for such viruses, and initiate this uncoating process through particle expansion, which reveals channels through which internal capsid proteins and the viral genome presumably exit the particle, although this has not been clearly seen until now. Here we present the atomic structure of an uncoating intermediate for the major human picornavirus pathogen CAV16, which reveals VP1 partly extruded from the capsid, poised to embed in the host membrane. Together with previous low-resolution results, we are able to propose a detailed hypothesis for the ordered egress of the internal proteins, using two distinct sets of channels through the capsid, and suggest a structural link to the condensed RNA within the particle, which may be involved in triggering RNA release.",""

During this process, particles acquire the outer capsid proteins and a transient envelope. Previous immunocytochemical and biochemical studies have suggested that a rotavirus nonstructural glycoprotein, NS28, encoded by genome segment 10, is a transmembrane RER protein and that about 10,000 Mr of its carboxy terminus is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the RER. We have used in vitro binding experiments to examine whether NS28 serves as a receptor that binds subviral particles and mediates the budding process. Specific binding was observed between purified simian rotavirus SA11 single-shelled particles and RER membranes from SA11-infected monkey kidney cells and from SA11 gene 10 baculovirus recombinant-infected insect cells. Membranes from insect cells synthesizing VP1, VP4, NS53, VP6, VP7, or NS26 did not possess binding activity. Comparison of the binding of single-shelled particles to microsomes from infected monkey kidney cells and from insect cells indicated that a membrane-associated component(s) from SA11-infected monkey kidney cells interfered with binding. Direct evidence showing the interaction of NS28 and its nonglycosylated 20,000-Mr precursor expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and single-shelled particles was obtained by cosedimentation of preformed receptor-ligand complexes through sucrose gradients. The domain on NS28 responsible for binding also was characterized. Reduced binding of single-shelled particles to membranes was seen with membranes treated with (i) a monoclonal antibody previously shown to interact with the C terminus of NS28, (ii) proteases known to cleave the C terminus of NS28, and (iii) the Enzymobead reagent. VP6 on single-shelled particles was suggested to interact with NS28 because (i) a monoclonal antibody to the subgroup I epitope on VP6 reduced particle binding, (ii) a purified polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant baculovirus-produced VP6 reduced ligand binding, and (iii) a monoclonal antibody to a conserved epitope on VP6 augmented ligand binding. These experimental data provide support for the hypothesized receptor role of NS28 before the budding stage of rotavirus morphogenesis.",""

Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is sufficient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1530021b7bfa50cb5697b6376646b5bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/209423049e70a8a0b3ef50ea0c124f07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f25dfc33881b33afa541ef1c28a9426, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4f80a5d78e3fad7d95ca25172f918726, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61f5f33f489a62fbe9d029ea98793a1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/65a762e7365e5614187b59d89936a9b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f55e38eff9f0cbfe80f616237a42b68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88f6e831daf048ffa0d23a3d500f9705, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b89ee4693456f679d8890024805df99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bc7bd8307e3348fe2d1e679cc183b4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/997c540b1ebd858060588f4130697642, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e4ef1256ea64c86d1682ca91efef128, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a03ec6fc0476a50acc358638ed09832e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2dd0d3a7209001d8f5c629474799db4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd6e2fb04f0c2ff4ecf1a03d1088f2ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cfc69fd7a7e5dd74e71cfcc814e19929, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d510f297d7b82fc33dd82bc5d84a67d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8f239b451f7bec25cea047ac583bbd6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e42d1f204fb86c14db3984b2485924bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4a297868c53b7edbe510e7ed5e814f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f888b3467a9b1f4e0d4623ccf9dfa913"

Because effective therapies are lacking, early identification and mitigation of risk factors is a pragmatic approach to improve outcomes. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the most pervasive risk factor for CLAD, but diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy, which carries risks. We hypothesized that gene expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellet (CP) could replace biopsy and inform on mechanisms of CLAD. METHODS We performed RNA sequencing on BAL CPs from 219 lung transplant recipients with A-grade ACR (n = 61), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (n = 58), infection (n = 41), or no rejection/infection (n = 59). Differential gene expression was based on absolute fold difference >2.0 and Benjamini-adjusted p-value ≤0.05. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resource for pathway analyses. For classifier modeling, samples were randomly split into training (n = 154) and testing sets (n = 65). A logistic regression model using recursive feature elimination and 5-fold cross-validation was trained to optimize area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS Differential gene expression identified 72 genes. Enriched pathways included T-cell receptor signaling, natural killer cell–mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction. A 4-gene model (AUC = 0.72) and classification threshold defined in the training set exhibited fair performance in the testing set; accuracy was 76%, specificity 82%, and sensitivity 60%. In addition, classification as ACR was associated with worse CLAD-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.29–4.53). CONCLUSIONS BAL CP gene expression during ACR is enriched for immune response pathways and shows promise as a diagnostic tool for ACR, especially ACR that is a precursor of CLAD.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/092ef22954f9c7ffdfe6a11ef19d49f8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c58e78f57b86bf46e86bee941724bbc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/32628679540fe3bc087fbd47deb5f685, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/391c078dbf3af2e25b8b36c5739b5a63, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/41bcfc3a9fef4b2cd2976d90855d8630, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43048fd04501da67b41a8443ea0a6e73, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45bfeab717d42e806765d09b4beb6922, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b854389bb2d47488c7ff3af91337a09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fad62ee3bb226fafb11ea0f99b2b872, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/506a462f7f579df314472ceda7841386, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/559e2786fc6dbbd2ac7ce39c1a361b32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a6daed3f8821da0d00bcbc8ac190f99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61e3ce6443f895bde7f00dea2822ffc1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6786c8f9addb49ff33afee9f9ca79595, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6887b4a9699b11bd93312320fb649f00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85df6547c2472ba5709431ca52dd78b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95ecef918008b6013bd51d67d7aaad59, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e51368a216a5a2d92ac805199b5dfdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e7a03a5912de5353147c2433c38f305, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a289a2315f7f96864164a204c7ddc193, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aeec7bd47d1e8e7fe45edcba26797f74, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af4dd401a67d4c6cd9b811f66cc3c28b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b055f6497b1d5c17405838a3cc0ec13e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c17fd4b681639cd99d6758ad74c085fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c32ef7fc195ef2375ed173566e7dea8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0d717f1aee34633c29c970ed2160890, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d4fd2b3565c8b41d0da6db5ccb96c8f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e145d234169e081e3009e38ecbcb6264, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3d32ca7f402b39fbb5d0569ac154643, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f44c6845a1c72518f2b2738c393ebe7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4827a95a86e5628949b3c334cc4205d"

A critical appraisal of this literature also reveals ambiguities relating to the scope and necessary structural components underpinning the surveillance process. The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies translate to real or perceived deficiencies in the conceptual framework of population health surveillance. This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations. METHODS: The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors' system of thinking and was based on a creative process. RESULTS: Population health surveillance includes two broad components: one relating to the human organization (which includes expertise and the administrative program), and one relating to the system per se (which includes elements of design and method) and which can be viewed as a process. The population health surveillance process is made of five sequential interrelated steps: 1) a trigger or need, 2) problem formulation, 3) surveillance planning, 4) surveillance implementation, and 5) information communication and audit. CONCLUSIONS: The population health surveillance theory provides a systematic way of understanding, organizing and evaluating the population health surveillance process.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13580dc4a103d0913f918216a9a18533, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b9130779442224d1fd90b29034ff4d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/69c091b76b87b65416df0a4016d2df09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9b0a51d56eccc877262ca937fad8f8c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bdd2ae6fbcc0ec8659fd290be1d6dd80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7a055911bdcc883865c4b1992056c06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1333b859f7264d00a1f1687cf16604b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fd7bc258e8b4dfe05a0b93466870802d"

While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less well studied and their potential roles in fungal dimorphism were largely unknown. Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P<0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1(KO), dcl-2(KO), dcl(DKO) and qde-2(KO) deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 (KD), supporting regulatory function of milRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provided the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2362ff09abf262e308923bab3886a69e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5282ce539ed744d0e8d39422b4903218, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eb9d438523fc2763f08f5b2cd7ef956, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6873d6ef31a88cc5fe7312c0b8072e1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73c30d306375f42705ac98febc40410e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a39317112cae9576e0bb026151b3307, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a8f7b8ce8bb471c516e9001cb6acd26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2bc65a553cd0360f150782de94fc323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf30b86232d85643213ca2b050b24da5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce64814425e415c3bc8515c34b128d27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d3792ef6f59e2e2a6b84eb868d619fbf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e867316099ce76349b79f5a2edf09448, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1e975d8028138c54aa5d3a925fc765f"

The model accounts for stochastic interaction between bacteria and cells of the immune system and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection of individual hosts within a population. Model output is the dose–response relation and the dose-dependent distribution of time until response, where response is the onset of symptoms. The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium. Results indicate a median infectious dose of about 23 organisms, which is higher than previously thought, and an average incubation period of between 3 and 7 days depending on dose. The distribution of incubation periods is right-skewed up to about 100 organisms and symmetric for larger doses. Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose–response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model). The findings of this study support experimental evidence and postulations from other investigations that response is, in fact, influenced by both in-host and between-host variability.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07a8dbeb07b2b42a937dace34c1ce57d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/136b7702c2bc3fabb6f9a8b471aca493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/136fe27af4c9c51b3e89676fd3f6fddb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d91732c29b31b25c46a73b110326d2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/262e22282b417bd36d6857e49ae3bc20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a69d0b813816e26dd35bb25bd822f47, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c5f7877a28a725d920aa32b9ffdee2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e8ce1769e74379aa2b24907b6764dcb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4149e641944d0a14737ddee37ab38879, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a295ef90e8cc25e27282e8e679a7bbb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58aa95c6a0ac376503bf8e8382d339bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cfd5882961bba27c8c28e495e2d55ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87cd9b2ca75885db5c788599aabe2769, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92f6fbd6c8ba2bc4ed6fbfd04b292e7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a0972bf424d739e10b533430324028ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b162f9af90fa3323426cefed277a2d20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbdb63d06385d19ac9bd1c6ea5ca29e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdc1aae86b031fbf789c7895925e92e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d774e68dcd284f25c7db405e67fa13cd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e118460e3ff1c3a5256cad8cc99f4fdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee5f7337ba0e379d7ab900e1f6231943"

The central nervous system (CNS) GJs are important for maintenance of myelin sheath and neuronal activity. Connexin (Cx) proteins are building blocks of GJs. Recent cell-biological investigations show that amongst the CNS specific Cxs, the most abundant Cx protein, Cx43 and its oligodendrocytic coupling partner Cx47 primarily important for maintenance of CNS myelin. Recent investigations elucidate that the expression of Cx43 and Cx47 is very important to maintain K+ buffering and nutrient homeostasis in oligodendrocytes, CNS myelin and oligodendrocyte function. The investigations on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient samples and EAE hypothesized that the functional loss of Cx43/Cx47 could be associated with spread of chronic MS lesions. Exploring the mechanism of initial GJ alteration and its effect on demyelination in this model of MS might play a primary role to understand the basis of altered CNS homeostasis, observed during MS. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of CNS GJs, specifically the Cx43/Cx47 axis in the perspective of demyelination.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0596a11d08739106709b6c3930bb5d1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0fa786a2c66f92d368946999c1914508, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/152981ec6671d71c1cfb78806b66230f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2055a7c2de1f2516d8e68cad7a947213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/212de18f7e2e00d344a5e9f46a2f3b76, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38b56e0f0dfa750a54a44f87764cedf5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/40b48275ee4fcadadd42452228daa25c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4421b31f34b28246aff79cf24f7fb593, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/480822584ac2fda589221daa5cc92068, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a83b00c54ca0969833d5a1224abcef8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4b7fcc282c2d8d7d9ae64986d6dc7755, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5356637e7b62e372ff47c1c10bd1c53e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54e6a3423f1ea48a980e6f456b80a524, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55526880e47a4e061931659c9311374b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ebd676dd446a121f1ac566eba7dfe82, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/66b1a9d0c963b789de372a3cc79000aa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73a5b5aacc542ba21c2220d3ff8c7c0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f4978166b16790dbc32b493c5aa4a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7998060396917ffa505763a4638fa4b8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88712ba71e20996a6939a974bd8a6852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92917f4bc93cb899c137285fd281af26, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a21eef4d906a9bc667c3c766aa3d1f89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6409a583fcf337401c0e34b87693022, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a82264ca318905715b9584fa2915e8b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ad3e1a17c93df9a977d2b15fef8164ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b18f9cc447b20ad4ed03eb4d141c8de4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b4622dac93630689ce97503f87fa7533, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bce170cc379a25b4aada873b1d93fc4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cca0a1d5658b55e65bba1d48059a25c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d40b3fc5f684f288f3f3d0b7669764ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d5f1c9274deba7380ddf50b9459677b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d72c394db43c06eb81409aee2cf10e7e"

The animals died cf acute hepatitis with high viral titres in the liver accompanied by many necrotic foci and high serum transaminase levels. Resistance to virus was re-established by refeeding HC mice with a normal diet for 2 weeks. This of modification by pathogenesis was accompanied by an increase in the susceptibility of hepatocyte cultures from HC mice to MHV3 and could be explained by an enhancement in virus adsorption.

Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools.",""

METHODS: The assembly process was hypothesized to occur via an orchestrated proteolytic processing of the P1 precursor by the viral protease 3CD. To test this hypothesis, we constructed 3 recombinant baculoviruses: Bac-P1 expressing P1; Bac-3CD expressing 3CD; and Bac-P1-3CD co-expressing P1 and 3CD. RESULTS: Both single infection by Bac-P1-3CD and co-infection by Bac-P1 and Bac-3CD resulted in correct cleavage of P1 to yield individual proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, while the former approach yielded higher VLP production. In the cells, the structural proteins self-assembled into clusters of virus-like particles (VLP) resembling the authentic EV71 particle aggregates. After ultracentrifugation purification, the dispersed VLPs were indistinguishable from the authentic virus in size, appearance, composition and surface epitopes, as determined by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. CONCLUSION: Our data, for the first time, suggest that in insect cells EV71 structural proteins adopt a processing and assembly pathway similar to poliovirus assembly. The preservation of particle morphology and composition suggest that the VLP may be a valuable vaccine candidate to prevent EV71 epidemics.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/422d17112ea85e69b9ba4dcb28d72bb1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f6ffc70ba915705c85700bc42caf8b0"

In this review, we examine the variability in the individual peptides produced in different tissues and the impact of the simultaneous presence of their precursors or fragments. We also discuss the problems inherent in accurately measuring which of the precursors and their derived peptides are present in biological samples. We address how not being able to measure all the combinations of precursors and fragments quantitatively has affected our understanding of the pathophysiology associated with POMC processing. To understand how different ratios of peptides arise, we describe the role of the pro-hormone convertases (PCs) and their tissue specificities and consider the cellular processing pathways which enable regulated secretion of different peptides that play crucial roles in integrating a range of vital physiological functions. In the pituitary, correct processing of POMC peptides is essential to maintain the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and this processing can be disrupted in POMC-expressing tumors. In hypothalamic neurons expressing POMC, abnormalities in processing critically impact on the regulation of appetite, energy homeostasis, and body composition. More work is needed to understand whether expression of the POMC gene in a tissue equates to release of bioactive peptides. We suggest that this comprehensive view of POMC processing, with a focus on gaining a better understanding of the combination of peptides produced and their relative bioactivity, is a necessity for all involved in studying this fascinating physiological regulatory phenomenon.",""

Since pathology in such diseases is often attributed to an over-active inflammatory response, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells respond to stimulation of their receptors for viral ligands with a strong antiviral response, but unlike in human cells, the inflammatory response is not overtly activated. We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNFα, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation. We examined the bat TNFα promoter and found a potential repressor (c-Rel) binding motif. We demonstrated that c-Rel binds to the putative c-Rel motif in the promoter and knocking down c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNFα transcripts. Our results suggest bats may have a unique mechanism to suppress inflammatory pathology.",""

However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412–419 (epitope I) and 434–446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.",""

The goal of this study was to assess the contributions of CXCL10 to the pathogenesis of experimental septic shock in mice. METHODS: Septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice resuscitated with lactated Ringer’s solution and, in some cases, the broad spectrum antibiotic Primaxin. Studies were performed in CXCL10 knockout mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Endpoints included leukocyte trafficking and activation, core body temperature, plasma cytokine concentrations, bacterial clearance and survival. RESULTS: CXCL10 was present at high concentrations in plasma and peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced septic shock. Survival was significantly improved in CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10KO) mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to controls. CXCL10KO mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG showed attenuated hypothermia, lower concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) in plasma and lessened natural killer (NK) cell activation compared to control mice. Compared to control mice, bacterial burden in blood and lungs was lower in CXCL10-deficient mice but not in mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG. Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 IgG plus fluids and Primaxin at 2 or 6 hours after CLP significantly improved survival compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG under the same conditions. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL10 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CLP-induced septic shock and could serve as a therapeutic target during the acute phase of septic shock.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/060e016110e9872ecf0c35881fbafd68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d33fd24badd53f71e23ea93592fc2ad,

The relationship between cough and the severity of asthma is ill defined. A study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that, in children with asthma who cough as a major part of their asthma symptoms, cough receptor sensitivity (CRS) is heightened during an acute severe exacerbation of asthma but not in the non-acute phase and airway calibre or its change correlates with CRS. METHODS: Spirometric measurements and the capsaicin CRS test were performed on children admitted to hospital for an acute severe exacerbation of asthma. Nasal secretions were tested for viruses. The children were grouped into those who usually cough with asthma episodes and those who do not. The tests were repeated 7-10 days and 4-6 weeks later. The CRS outcome measure used was the concentration of capsaicin required to stimulate two (Cth) and five coughs (C5). RESULTS: The CRS of the group who coughed (n = 15) was significantly higher than those who did not cough (n = 16) (mean difference log Cth 0.77 mumol (95% CI 0.35 to 1.18), C5 0.72 mumol (95% CI 0.26 to 1.18)) during acute asthma but not after the exacerbation. CRS was not significantly different between groups based on the presence of a viral infection. Neither forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) nor its change correlated with CRS nor its change. CONCLUSIONS: In children with asthma CRS is heightened in acute severe asthma in the subgroup of children who have cough as a significant symptom with their asthma episodes. In acute and non-acute asthma CRS does not correlate with FEV1.",""

The greater IFN response of AT cells compared to BT cells following poly I:C stimulation with or without ncp BVDV infection, may be the basis for the decreased BVDV permissiveness of AT cells and may contribute to the clinical differences following BVDV infection of alpacas and cattle.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/242166bd220e3c6ccd82c8bcd010a637, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b3fd4aeeec010619e23d23d1a51b0e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/303fa0354bdb91e2378d30074f768863, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d0f83278d8d61ba165878f02d8183da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/46ac0ac74c399be70b2d030dbbaab145, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a14bdc11ad91b71a75a1443cb46105c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ff833d1825416f70828c2cc199da41b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71658c2145e6732cbc9fe7c2905c72a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/76f5032546d76dfbc7ccb4fbf3c941f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b97d1d0dbd2349918d2f84a7c11d25a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8132450380e39bf319367e2f53e3e443, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82708d603c271f6fb29ae39224d4d985, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/884342da215895539f05a114f216e296, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8da45e251014ffa6ae53dd516bdd52bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98fd24f7e3c8fdab02fb6363c58d6232, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99eac88a910d5f4880616edb46aca7b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a76bd304d71315a31178ff48654f235, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9c70654b646849a7e8644e8c80560ec8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9da236af56e0b95c7c3bc67b3fc6ad16, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a286c059544780fb7fc4fce6b3fafb20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a28a7d9d863760b5df8953a820649253, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a714bd0bd8a6ff62a7b226119aba8d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa11dc604224c6130e934287febf37ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab2f81f509e5ce746cd5b923a918527e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5c8ce17deb62b275562c8023fac5505, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d147eb3abdd1d080b84d7d1d702b7f8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d82ff72d3aedb3cf116e8d4743d4ea1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d898995f8621733cc00547002dc34230, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de732212d8c3bfc4896d2c9f397adf4e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0c4101cebed80fddb40f2738d9b8167, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec2ffabe35bdb58db9da2d2e2f5ecc58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/edfdb423c23d86b05d6a2da1321918c4"

In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community’s interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based ones, to communicate aerial spraying’s risks and benefits.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/07263c1db7945bafc76cc6df6b380f97, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/14f66593b82532ef641e80f1f11aad0b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26b3edeb510f68c6ee2ac8568bb476eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26e314f8b13c25c87c9cf5ec95ae5290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a32cae2e76821ca691c68b5a7b4a2e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cfd30c3e0bef740f3bc3a1241e6053a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3d0748d18cf7f376ae25c024f1cb21d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58e1b38ec929b194eff6ebf10d8ff4fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63f4f2e70d7464284f4f5523aa0a1ac8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d52c099be81ae263557d85a649df5fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70280a5ed6cb9ef98d8d4b746ced49a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7bceec2bb64dd9060502acf26a4f9d0e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a4573e7a4dde33c987e08389ab54e7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8dd4461296868e5e6a005f02a8d03085, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93f0ba69891016a2bef5fea6359bd82c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99885026dc0878cc798089a150aaa79a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ffc70615cd8f81ee0bac38db0b0aa6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0f571af56374a4fad49ee9017e9e7da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c61f4908f7ed2287bdfe6339c7a86246, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce9e7c194a61c071655919c1c9a53e33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d73d16f954eff0936d54d08cf7218d0a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc30c8622fe8baf2ca8348bda01eec4f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff2f5d9ccffb21fec994169684399f32"

Air samplers are used to collect, identify, and quantify bioaerosols. Studies comparing the performances of air samplers have typically used a culture approach or have targeted a specific microorganism in laboratory settings. The objective of this study was to use environmental field samples to compare the efficiencies of 3 high-airflow-rate samplers for describing bioaerosol diversity using a next-generation sequencing approach. Two liquid cyclonic impactors and one electrostatic filter dry sampler were used in four wastewater treatment plants to target bacterial diversity and in five dairy farms to target fungal diversity. The dry electrostatic sampler was consistently more powerful in collecting more fungal and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Substantial differences in OTU abundances between liquid and dry sampling were revealed. The majority of the diversity revealed by dry electrostatic sampling was not identified using the cyclonic liquid impactors. The findings from this work suggest that the choice of a bioaerosol sampler should include information about the efficiency and ability of samplers to cover microbial diversity. Although these results suggest that electrostatic filters result in better coverage of the microbial diversity among the tested air samplers, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. While it is difficult to determine a single universally optimal air sampler, this work provides an in-depth look at some of the considerations that are essential when choosing an air sampler for studying the microbial ecology of bioaerosols. IMPORTANCE Associating bioaerosol exposure and health problems is challenging, and adequate exposure monitoring is a priority for scientists in the field. Conclusions that can be drawn from bioaerosol exposure studies are highly dependent on the design of the study and the methodologies used. The air sampling strategy is the first methodological step leading to an accurate interpretation of what is present in the air. Applying new molecular approaches to evaluate the efficiencies of the different types of samplers used in the field is necessary in order to circumvent traditional approaches and the biases they introduce to such studies. The results and conclusions provided in this paper should be taken in consideration when conducting a bioaerosol study.",""

Microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation, but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critical role in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS. METHODS: The impact of CSF1R signaling during West Nile virus infection was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of neurotropic infection. Pharmacological inactivation of CSF1R was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging neuropathogen. The subsequent effect of CSF1R antagonism on virologic control was assessed by measuring mortality and viral titers in the CNS and peripheral organs. Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric-based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells. RESULTS: Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal WNV infection and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery. CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co-stimulatory signals on peripheral and CNS antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by depleting CNS cellular sources, which limited local reactivation of CNS-infiltrating virus-specific T cells and reduced viral clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following neurotropic viral infection.

Both siRNAs knockdown or silenced the target RABV genes as evaluated in a plasmid based transient expression model. For efficient delivery, adenoviruses expressing the siRNAs were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered siRNAs was investigated in BHK-21 cells. When cells treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged with RABV, there was 88.35±2.4% and 41.52±9.3% reduction in RABV multiplication in infected cells with siRNAs targeting RABV-N and L genes, respectively. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR revealed knockdown of both RABV-N and L gene transcripts, however, significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N. When mice treated intracerebrally with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged peripherally with lethal RABV by the intramuscular route in masseter muscle, there was 66.6% and 33.3% protection with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs against RABV-N and L genes, respectively. These results demonstrated that adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N efficiently inhibited the RABV multiplication both, in vitro and in vivo and conferred significant protection against lethal RABV challenge. This supported the hypothesis that RNAi, based on siRNA targeting RABV-N gene can prevent RABV infection and holds the potential of RNAi as an approach to prevent rabies infection.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13402ed162122e62127df31e51b7c05a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b45e00a86ef43e3250ccf57e18268e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/21dc0896e553bb3e014c271cd125b996, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f0018bcb042b1fa8334ea93936c456d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f064cdf6721c8f66e076ec40108439b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3e33504355d5785171778a56358b4873, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fb5c4963c0c1f151fe17f81056db33d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/44d892494c900a5e5e8a268969109556, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4528cba46a99cd2db45afae4845665e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/553aa4e23de794887387c03caf0fc3f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56a9db07721cd192eb847ee94e8c95a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cdbf0531bfda07b51426847cb8507f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5f0f562e2cb7dd573bd8562e2d23da91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62afe603c3cd26c9d23088677dd2fc5e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a3e7280435faad1240eb26bec3140b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a566346084678612c2b7f58a5195e21, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7350891a316f0e529b4d3ce6b5fabda1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8011fc562d6127030e671a474c8e49a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/832abbbd898eb59817a3dddc17f16ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/87aaec8adb1505fc89615f7cdaf3aee9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a6479b5f30bf8513474e3a7925ed02b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94aec19201df7915c57e4de6f47401d8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/969e1e0b224ddd51ab4a2d456b328f8f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9796bb1dab96b214dd5a31269b9f0b37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0b99894b623fa0127406ee26627a217, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1a7ca28730c182803cbb5a37590efb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b28c7def844c9d69380935321db22d6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b55507c8d4f2ded0fd868626c5cffe2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b873026dd3cad0c5c44e39dc6420cd91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c1cfd6fca65ce4ed339fc411705db83c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c21f7a0408499ea621375ddc1200a552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c302e6d235aaab72e99e173445b07a66, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c89d9a8341332d2e5653aa3752780728, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ce1be3799186a76d6ea7ca2a1075bca4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0f27a453262c6ddc90ebba85d95d0e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e21a366cc6630f5080b12fff3db158d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ebd26ea972ba4803f876b4e0d17100a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0a6178c34292baa13f9ba767f421d67, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0da5eac3c381f72da9a0830965047f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2537ebc74629e3922fd1e47eab91054"

The dynamics of natural infection in camels are not well understood. Through systematic surveillance in Egypt, nasal, rectal, milk, urine and serum samples were collected from camels between June 2014 and February 2016. Locations included quarantines, markets, abattoirs, free-roaming herds and farmed breeding herds. The overall seroprevalence was 71% and RNA detection rate was 15%. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence (90% vs 61%) and higher RT-PCR detection rates (21% vs 12%) than locally raised camels. Juveniles had lower seroprevalence than adults (37% vs 82%) but similar RT-PCR detection rates (16% vs 15%). An outbreak in a breeding herd, showed that antibodies rapidly wane, that camels become re-infected, and that outbreaks in a herd are sustained for an extended time. Maternal antibodies titers were very low in calves regardless of the antibody titers of the mothers. Our results support the hypothesis that camels are a reservoir for MERS-CoV and that camel trade is an important route of introducing the virus into importing countries. Findings related to waning antibodies and re-infection have implications for camel vaccine development, disease management and zoonotic threat.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/049b5ccc753564529a6326a537c5dfdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0adabc3abdb67189ce2e5312dddb0e7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0bc796ced985d210fe9889d6f46a5ff6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c75df4b221a332c3b6f0b369633afd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e4ae9581ebbcd5b746df45e1d8fc728, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/12bfe2553abab90e1ed501296f237520, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/158f3e08fb3198d0bef89bc9509b3ebb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/30fde2753fa5eafacba0c36f2faa4f3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36685d122fd733b5b062ea6927215c96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5630526ba0dd6ee1de70e4d7a7c1cfe2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56d563d4898c20849ff44d9228b1d9a3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cff85508e4eb3e8550485c9e3139fd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b89acacfecbf944f1435f3e00066592, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d3604f6ea1c8809e5ed1db191baf56f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/716dc74ee16dc27a783d3b3d5aa4dc7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73048fce282e1dbd9a869d4c53511c2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77a616e26dc647e0ce1816a0b9b6570a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8128d0512d001e54243ba1c6afd8771d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82ac4e2f603ac2b65e83b3dcdc6e6797, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82e690e5659248cdfa448d72597ddbff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/98be31fe8d98f69c783cded6b1fdeb88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa1bef4fb547a216e1f22afa74bc28f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2840da575c28341e4187d63eac89d8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d23219465abb93c968d8953242cd5773, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df318bb9bfd2f9d9e00e47a03e55060f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec7c735e4780c5be558e4dd1997adb85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f016abf223e1092ca98986edd7f55728, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f79e549aa2488ab11e1b30b9a08b469f"

RESULTS: Primer sequence is converted to a vector of the full potential hydrogen numbers (3 for G or C, 2 for A or T), while template sequence is converted to a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed after primer annealing. The former is considered as source information and the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template. CONCLUSION: Successful prediction of PCR products from whole genomic sequences with a computer program based on the algorithm demonstrated the potential of this new algorithm in areas like in silico PCR and gene finding.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb904debacb9b5fcec8084d6b86c1fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ef833242a2b98ed1bef278405218a62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fb9022015043af85ea77593282c6627, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c9aa90108f66471f9f3ad11de038ba46"

Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection. This data supports the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/68b92502dd71a2e97842ae3055b2c7ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/842e1d648d9f26117f796210ab86890f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/99e8a1cb1764dc1112a7a42515064288, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a485abc87b53eb3210cfbfd8852b4f3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ae0ee835d0bd7edf8ee4a751473df086, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af8723f50cbce46ff35e71fe6ae1ffa0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6c961c891c69091ba5e6ade0011c4d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da0dd6a13d5399a52f35b49c298732a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef02db3cbef985715b9b9a309eec3041"

While the hypothesis that dromedary camels are the likely major source of MERS-CoV infection in humans is gaining acceptance, conjecture continues over the original natural reservoir host(s) and specifically the role of bats in the emergence of the virus. Dromedary camels were imported to Australia, principally between 1880 and 1907 and have since become a large feral population inhabiting extensive parts of the continent. Here we report that during a focussed surveillance study, no serological evidence was found for the presence of MERS-CoV in the camels in the Australian population. This finding presents various hypotheses about the timing of the emergence and spread of MERS-CoV throughout populations of camels in Africa and Asia, which can be partially resolved by testing sera from camels from the original source region, which we have inferred was mainly northwestern Pakistan. In addition, we identify bat species which overlap (or neighbour) the range of the Australian camel population with a higher likelihood of carrying CoVs of the same lineage as MERS-CoV. Both of these proposed follow-on studies are examples of “proactive surveillance”, a concept that has particular relevance to a One Health approach to emerging zoonotic diseases with a complex epidemiology and aetiology.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/102713a63e154343f0e1860c3799b0f1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1120e78fef25846f520ea3d93da5b606, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1281d82e5b4ffb218d81e5a1c184120b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/167fde4b03716e029aaa72c9a7fa7dfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1d68c8ed8639c6667521b0425e911e42, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c62f8ec9b85b591731df850ef1393b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2e519e577f04f808b3bc4ada1ffe2678, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33f5a2e86c090e246a03318c697f717f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/365f6bb90d6a5e245e98f16adb7821e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49afa39a180d7155d2d17ef90fc45747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fd6e50282034488e8f4ce07e137427e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6a20edbf4015ccc9f684ad5ecf76bbe1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71394037be72a163ade1b6e5a449ffed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/717b421b1d50cfff5e04c4d643cd751a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/833a3a1a7b5ea55d685140a51603826a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/879f4afd6329b15a6c62b232272606d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e854d4758a5393a645716f6a89d6fd3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a86de87c797e3b538ab6563b40596544, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a8b043c785f603bf107fabba9c3bd61c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aea9c933798c6955be08c4a2115c9e45, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6af816127321537e3e8a3364c0eb019, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d03f8024306fd12da3293a4d2de20af7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1eed8a2420ba245baeefddaea7424b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ff17b1ad0b943a036a0b2532e528e8ad"

We hypothesized that such an excessive response to respiratory tract viral infection is caused by host factors reflected in pre-existing increased bronchial responsiveness. Objective We sought to compare bronchial responsiveness and lung function in 1-month-old neonates who later develop acute severe bronchiolitis with those who do not. Methods We measured infant lung function (n = 402) and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (n = 363) using the raised-volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique before any respiratory symptoms in 1-month-old neonates from the Copenhagen Prospective Study of Asthma in Childhood birth cohort born to mothers with asthma. The children were prospectively monitored for respiratory symptoms and given a diagnosis of acute severe bronchiolitis according to a fixed algorithm. Results Thirty-four (8.5%) infants had acute severe bronchiolitis before 2 years of age, 21 (62%) were hospitalized, and 23 (67%) of the cases were associated with respiratory syncytial virus. Children who later had acute severe bronchiolitis irrespective of viral species had a 2.5-fold increased responsiveness to methacholine (provocative dose of methacholine producing a 15% decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure [PD15]) at age 1 month compared with control subjects (median PD15 in cases vs control subjects, 0.13 vs 0.33 μmol; P = .01), whereas differences in baseline airflow were not significant for forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, −0.18 vs −0.01; P = .36) and forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, −0.37 vs −0.09; P = .13). Conclusion Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in at-risk neonates precedes acute severe bronchiolitis in response to infections with respiratory tract virus.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b2fc7bb19a34738d60e9afc96bc1553, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c90e3c4b0ab917beef3cea8fe374e41, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29928354e10e050fb3f1f3d9cba60b4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f0a99343bd1205da01e8fd4d53d05f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3816f5f4c99264ab67c842efa673a877, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a67b0621617e4daafb025b8995abffa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d60c35af31077d07b06b1bef9d18925, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/504bdced176ab43ceb3ff3257897b94a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/624a0e4f95e5197457f3cf09915741b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/692bf38b8f2dce20ae623f4e7bce4fc2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83da9c0754c439aa0ddec085503a5da6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8956c13aa82388dd94c9133a24e7d425, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8bb9df0ae029ff86b1488b0256c212b9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9854d25848ed87b5ffab7b9f4cb036d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ed9e54bfea0dc7237e7a99490eb8213, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a285db2e1a077ecab2a61644f241de48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b12f2ca9442876a0a05d8f47c01039a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc355f8ed0f25cef677a8d377fdb1848, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cc47cfda2de753dd6ea5f7bf0a740497, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d25be07d29b46bfca3865564d1184e8b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec46c73ba51da7b7d86fc3311c61897f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f16e0f7c0d7ade5334f8f2a28c018ff9"

LPV binding to the highly susceptible human B-lymphoma cell line BJA-B K88 is specific, saturable, and noncooperative. Binding occurs very fast, with an association rate constant (k1) of 6.7 x 10(7) M-1s-1, and is of high affinity, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.9 x 10(-12) M; and the virus-receptor complex is stable, with a half life of 70 min. The binding affinities of receptors on four other highly, moderately, or weakly susceptible human B-lymphoma cell lines were similar, with up to twofold variation around a mean Kd value of 3 x 10(-12) M, suggesting the presence of the same LPV receptor on all of these cell lines. This view is further supported by the finding that in all cases a terminal sialic acid is necessary for LPV binding. Tunicamycin has been shown to drastically induce LPV susceptibility and LPV binding in weakly and moderately susceptible B-lymphoma cell lines (O.T. Keppler, M. Herrmann, M. Oppenländer, W. Meschede, and M. Pawlita, J. Virol. 68:6933-6939, 1994). The hypothesis that the constitutively expressed and tunicamycin-induced LPV receptors are identical is strengthened by our finding that both receptor types displayed the same high affinity. LPV susceptibility of different B-lymphoma cell lines was correlated with receptor number but not with receptor affinity. The numbers of receptors per cell on highly and moderately susceptible cell lines ranged from 2,000 to 400 and were directly proportional to LPV susceptibility. This indicates that the number of high-affinity receptors per cell is a key regulating factor for the LPV host range.",""

Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression. Transient co-transfection assays indicated that Egr-1 negatively regulated the transcription of both full-length and intron-removed ICP22 promoters. The same assays also revealed that Egr-1 repressed ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4) promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but showed less inhibition when the intron was removed. Histone deacetylation was not involved in this regulation since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not exhibit any effect on Egr-1-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Egr-1 reduced the binding of Sp1 to the promoters and that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 in the presence of Egr-1. These results suggested that the multifunctional transcription factor Egr-1 can repress HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression through the recruitment of co-repressor Nab2 and reduction of Sp1 occupancy, and thus may play a critical role in HSV-1 gene silencing during latency.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/020a8a8ca2c50b1f246d7a84dde23814, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0855669fa530bc57daf621ac70513ea9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c0bf19024e8de3c2e8bc2ef58d92ac6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f8f6bbbc8592167b57156a55dc8951e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2430cfcf7fcb4318c15559c76fe0fa0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27aa0be3d381781f7701d9a63b97a846, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b962766ee6a616e73818c3450c9e237, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ffdd9f5271b0cebfe2f6459d37ae297, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/350a1d3eb961dc92eaec97f7af9c37c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/38a4f4b5726c8ceb3507f9b4237c1a0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3bc4cc9307191681100685bc578e55c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43d052c6a6bcb6655a0ba5d955927ffa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49e9722e104920e3e03ff521b49f999b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4db6d79d45214ca6712ee4e58e20ae60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/51bf5beaafc05496664e0fa2e37e845a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5888557329e3d06515b00326b27bdbda, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58b6261a8c53d1454c5a324454c27453, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5daab8cd104f89e3b637841812931852, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6041fa7ac0038f8c2fdc58bb9b212011, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61f6f0530e00fb3e5d49b685d4f50ff0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79b803d134872f1bf1bc9e7653ad0695, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a9c7b6238114d46510eb875ca7056ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82c73273830f71dd4b2d2b125a8500f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89a38bb155d26929d7375d153496f957, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d575ee7d61126bab54da7319b685dff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/930d14119fe00802c9b5de946a36663b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/974a2947f317159b4128aef9feb091a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a52de8aa7eef7ed3382c53bd669ff482, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a9f9945599e04106f31a67fb89ee064f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b164907208ec04d1c5fd3c4c9edaed00, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b1c2e9e525e7e2218913773f574056e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b78c4d5f3ddc10b9f308c4ed2f046104, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba903e5bc1f9139d8a83eab275dac21f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bddc78c466a02de23be3b77511e95a6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c0dd27a9d405d1f0ea2629b288e373a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c29d30e0c03f910b6f1a1704f5474b7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c43b631407d6e2bd1cc5050739838bf7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c461546503b48fc496698cfae1710fcd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd2e7ec057fa7e036d9de5a4996af1eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3bfb37c1decc7597e00b4e39d66e048, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4a9039f9613de86d7b2e146d80ac65a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5c0c1f40056cd8744c91878d3c1cd2b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e6b631bff8f729a4306fad4606d6a214, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8259e9c0170db43577d84ab9fef19b7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb4fecfd5c6654bf368358c651a7f795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee454117f0c994c2e057a44cea63c47c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f207f0700697aa52536e767573e497b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f85e99627c20d62d2686e7f20530b50f"

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/003034dce3d377f4f026e7553b48076b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01cd89acc4c9f26dd99890848cad96f5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0acfa79aa2fbb594def4ca965f787316, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1b871a1b20e6e65a1f4711067f421ea3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2488f28190f67eb243281ddeb5a9afb8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2be463ab35145a2d5ba1466add4eac58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31d29ff8d7eab78a8077f0e380f4ed09, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49695cd1c6aa8953c4efdb6202e33d9e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5eb42eae2528be8ed7094c9df6d84318, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61d610c32eb0d1e660465f9d0ea274ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/62170b35d28d751ff25ebac0f8084b0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/636c5243c42312982d6a589913b1df90, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d323c09981a1de8a2b7bb263e38baca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a1286fa4787a112549e01270512ce7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8329a336448d74e4c15484fed57b6df1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83acf0914a4b99b61561c0d41137e7ac, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92980b0b93d19218938e929693066be8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93ed8c0a4c21f0f11af2e1ba60c96cb3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/94683f6bbabe64fedaa67b5804c55c9b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9be042304c4818162124e69a43654309, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a64c814261246f6d8c952a02d7bcbaa0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a908c19b2b44974b5a5c754ad8233cee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aaa7e5d57e22dae77a28aab38d9f1ddc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bcdfc1e0a36e83020e343083c531e4af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bfab52fac79628eefbab896d74fbcaee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c40c3704b4037dd9cccdffc454820459, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5f195f127333bcaf60ff3168a7f30c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ced3fac2f54aa211b7af70153be9a407, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e37062fbbdd3a54da8d66af4cf89ce7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e42b659515b5d2fda89326cbd4bfaf0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ea1e5d42afcf6fd1e8f08dbe6be6334c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efe5226cde124fe9e6c96929afe4a26a"

While an RNA stem-loop structure (the “HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Signal”, or HIV-1 FSS) controls the frameshift efficiency and has been hypothesized as an attractive therapeutic target, developing compounds that selectively bind this RNA and interfere with HIV-1 replication has proven challenging. Building on our prior discovery of a “hit” molecule able to bind this stem-loop, we now report the development of compounds displaying high affinity for the HIV-1 FSS. These compounds are able to enhance frameshifting more than 50% in a dual-luciferase assay in human embryonic kidney cells, and they strongly inhibit the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV-1 virions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b7249d6e30ffe7735939f540a615f91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d62b4d3277f3e83728f3da82bdd125a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/147abfd1fd3de833eacef363616645d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bf8e7e40828119cdd8c70279482a33a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dcc12e8b7982152096606e53fbad3d9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/280dd7ae60a2cf4175e35f8fa54fa11e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/309aa76bd908651b95c7208b92ba3574, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3322703332bde32e8f6b9aa3526c78b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/365401a141df0231a967029605a6ce54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45b92815676b2ce4babf68845ef38397, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/50b52d0144b453b512192667b014205e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5145e73703b4d6162c459b5a5f2e2539, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5735f37dfd38f6fa01f82e0578343d77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5ad25a26da3433bce853303ffc9a56ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dd7d653c234953b20dd1e44916e7fa2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6c5c9515379d8bc0b1296136410c1821, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/875d90661537d1ce58c8d6d462a8704f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3c237edd5e3d495886218853f24938a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b84b237de8ce5db003143d9d04d1adb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c5fa6b0f1168aaf1335ee9fe1cb2df37, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c85d1c2fe75bdc964bd41382223e7cc5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cce20f4555ca8c3a9fb9a9f2e660bb89, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d093328d3422bc4173f803d421f9cd4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f109ecf45a4ca35849cffd6e7a98dce3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f11428063833e763db0fd7cde21cac07, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb3e06cc10dd90986c4556fcbe483d28"

RNA polymerases (RNA(pol)) generate enormous genetic and consequent antigenic heterogeneity permitting both viruses and cellular pathogens to evade host defences. Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules – including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors – that viruses co-opt for cell entry. This mechanism – %22Viral Receptor Disease (VRD)%22 – may explain so-called %22viral autoimmunity%22, some classical autoimmune disorders and other diseases, including type II diabetes mellitus, and some forms of obesity. Viral receptor disease is a unifying hypothesis that may also explain some diseases with well-established, but multi-factorial and apparently unrelated aetiologies – like coronary artery and other vascular diseases – in addition to diseases like schizophrenia that are poorly understood and lack plausible, coherent, pathogenic explanations.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0251cca887e279ddc4bf391552eb0795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b72516b1e8ced215440e51e0aa4cd2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/119c11bdce51dd12e42ae59e9cc48591, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1713adba74bc4364915cca4cd58deeec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e1420d44eb66780b0106ca11ac41bed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2663c402aec6e80825efa7f738d718a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aa2c8bfd11f9e028e028a39b8ffefab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bf2c3f8b8a495dc7e25d3add0c33bdb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/310e4289e3f67b5cd9aaf16ff967ac5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31f83578318319e1c7a90cc0398617f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31fd0d9696d1a8eb6ab8d042c212a044, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/326e5b19272162749d4b14793f41cc3a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3756fa70ab32c7682c68c1828c0c4d51, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3828ea2c5f899372a7f8e105e0eefbbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49db03780d6687407ee1c5ae61faa313, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4a4043c6e2e32f925f0fe66e0a3a5b77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/510cfb567cc339b47a6ecd97cb01dcc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/531e49a91ea432dbe4eba3e7c74c24b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/533c069665aafb5146263ed8c217ea0f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/54b2f5cd935b62d0f4c6ebfe66c6fa60, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/590faa4f39af2f5856866480c4f814c9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/618ea37e5ae7ea1761dfa66b6ed0c4f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63689e60e245a775bcbf3df03d449253, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/896aeb42eac2cfaa4f17940ab7e10165, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97bb84015b207666087af8174bd42ff9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7890325ca58f822ed9f538979bf34a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aefe48fb4e4feaec1a6e9074a093a40f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6f0ee791e157d78e91967ce1ed4a4a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b97d7a62d4c8cf1d54205f5c84778df7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b9c0280ad9b2c2633cb1905cab582f6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc3b2cfa6e76a4e53cca1d636305180e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c218732fe45ab9dae4b4c43dfa0c7b8a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ca8601abea7e69c0b20fcc929293da1d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cb90fe6ccc1993bba999f6e5f08fcabe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d15beec614c8cb64a1302b92b250d9f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d38befa6aa53110c59da7bf82dbb70e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8f27b5710767ccb8c06b57ab1a7f51d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da93bc96308e810383a2412d273c4e2d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dab61a0509fc8028bf4511e242aa5436, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df58c077d592c9f42422784e093827c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e51cdec3042e051494be3010786baa5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5592ba76b2046449729074ee2fc5831, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e5c871a1578b5e9bcd4f724a95d76f0c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e90740581a81db288ae13199c79b0f46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eec0645403973c75243df8eabc40a290, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f138e10052865c8b93e392f4d8d17b48, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f164686cbaa23638d89be74adbfcd1e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f1bda3b6094a9782491acfa4990ca5c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb5f91af98ef9e941858d2579ad656d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fddda10c04bcaf44b3671c1cc5a086cb"

Crazy because he decided to test in a human being a hypothesis based mainly in the traditional belief that people who had acquired cowpox from the udders of a cow were thereafter resistant to smallpox, a quite devastating disease, and lucky because (even considering that he did not know this at that time) he succeeded to induce protection against a pathogen through the induction of an immune response directed against a different agent. Not only was he able to protect the young man but he took the first step towards the development of a vast new field, vaccination. It is acceptable to say that Jenner was lucky because he succeeded in promoting protection against smallpox using a cowpox virus and this induction of protection in a cross-reactive way is believed to be quite rare. Nevertheless, more and more examples of cross-reactive immune responses are being described and we are beginning to admit that cross-reactivity is far more common and important than we used to think. Here we review cross-reactivity in the immune system and the plasticity of T cell recognition. Based on the existence of T cell receptor promiscuous recognition and cross-recognition of conserved viral immunodominant epitopes, we propose two approaches to develop wide spectrum viral vaccines. The first one is based on the identification, characterization, and cloning of immunodominant viral epitopes able to stimulate responses against different viruses. The produced peptides could then be purified and serve as a basis for vaccine therapies. A second strategy is based on the identification of conserved patterns in immunodominant viral peptides and the production of synthetic peptides containing the amino acid residues necessary for MHC anchoring and TCR contact. Although we are still far from a complete knowledge of the cross-reactivity phenomenon in the immune system, the analysis of immunodominant viral epitopes and the identification of particular “viral patterns” seems to be important steps towards the development of wide spectrum viral vaccines.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/118d844ce0ce4cfdb3c4940971d388c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/136061cde74ccab80db368404e1a0614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/172dd203adfb5977477538377c14e7a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2385b365536a4a12b43812a435e7e51a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/295c5b4ee2439f159b4ff4bde3d88dfa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c186384720c614e18fd1285f76264a8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3caed57d1acc37a90299671bb1e72606, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3ec4b08fb4e543aaf84fabc12809b136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/47b2633051878ac86cb47a9b29744984, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4884aae3fc18e4933f3fd441c0c7d136, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e3c52e356273d012d2ccd1bed6211ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a6ec9e32e8f69fffdb152f3e9d041c0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5af2c09f2702e1509b1cd11721243d94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/655d36bbbd207ceb97dc0720ac2031af, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71c72bb4b4a70b1543166e84c45dacfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/71f0bc7035374b49aa890d1a06839f35, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e3bf3643190b22b49c4de395496f5a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/780cd1fe9e0c4bd2f25ecf457327302d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e2df126bd3cc69e24adff6897caa3d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8313d7d6f2e12c610283aa6bccd46f1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d2fe02ff0f1ff82524e55a02591a46b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8e5131a61b47e774b33f457003b855fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e0d5dc38ab257bfe6af0f2a8097e5c4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a63138da713b5abaf90d6256df3e34e1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac935dbde735965da879e2dd3cc94f27, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b0b602442facacddd3cf2b3ba0009567, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b69541070475415899a0c53ce82fb2ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bc993fe5864ed493dbd6cb3c01ca2ec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf516a340445850bbc9a90a313726ac9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c375dcffad6d5c2b71fec3b893067ef2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c3d82d9d54648a1a28e3cd1b4d80098c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c42d0c22ba721ed2686154a52170bf85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dd2a91ac0cf3087c20558fe16aa97708, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de678d347c5564fabf20efff1097c159, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e9caf2d5df504bee7b9e94fdf0fbdce3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb1c278046fc821b7f891730eb831f3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ed916d571672a11a575ec3416145d93f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee3d496dd1b24339513db43a5a78d67e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f36bd34db7c37f3f0b049bfd12581eab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8eb94c35e075341786345de4140887f"

The decision sought to protect vulnerable Israeli individuals who were either not vaccinated with IPV or who suffered from an immune deficiency, to preserve Israel’s status as a polio-free country, to prevent the virus’ “exportation” into vulnerable polio-free countries, and to participate in the global efforts toward the eradication of polio. After a massive public persuasion campaign, 79% of the children born after 2004 were vaccinated as well as 69% of the children residing in central Israel. A 2014 State Comptroller Report stated that the Ministry of Health should draw conclusions from the low compliance rates in certain Israeli regions. GOALS: The article seeks to examine the legal legitimacy of mandatory vaccination in the service of eradicating a contagious disease (as opposed to preventing a pandemic outbreak), which was one of the objectives in the 2013 Polio case. It more specifically relates to current Israeli law as well as to a hypothetical new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination and enforce this through the use of criminal sanctions. METHOD: Qualitative content analysis through the interpretation of court judgements, laws, legislative protocols, health ministry guidelines and documented discussions of the Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases and Immunization. MAIN FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: A mandatory vaccination backed by criminal sanctions in the service of the eradication of contagious diseases would probably be perceived as infringing on the constitutional right to autonomy to a greater extent than necessary according to Israeli law and case law precedents. There may be some added value inherent in a new public health law which would authorize health officials to oblige vaccination where nonrestrictive measures have been ineffective. However, the law should also specify a variety of sanctions to accompany the enforcement of mandatory vaccinations which would be formulated from least to most restrictive according to the “intervention ladder” concept. The law should also describe the circumstances which would justify the implementation of each and every sanction as well as the procedural safeguards designed for established decisions and fairness toward the individual(s) whose rights are infringed by the application of these sanctions.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/027f0790301bd38f2bccff2de5f1fd9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03b0039dbf305f04364230289840df44, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1cdef15c5c32e5fd63ab6522cc8c1adf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/410d87125bb97e205190a94d74143945, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4553ac01039a1bf931b1c59c637844dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4d7cf31c2aafdc0f9eefe484d5708d58, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/750cbc3e8709eb0f1d177f6c7e83c535, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83d3958110de43204e58d75371c87212, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b2f8e8a78fea1dc891292785d4f8c358, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f020ed7f1cfced7ef0385e646fedcca9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fc4ff987fe266b73188d4476cb2ca712"

Although the two groups of viruses differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein, the gene (S) encoding this protein showed no evidence of positive selection or of an elevated mutation rate. Rather, the data suggested that recombination events have homogenized the portions of the genome other than the S gene between the two groups of viruses, while continuing to maintain the two distinct, anciently diverged versions of the S gene. The latter hypothesis was supported by a phylogeny of S proteins from representative coronaviruses, in which S proteins of AIBV and TCoV fell in the same clade.

We discuss how the number of different possible TCRs encoded in the genome (the potential repertoire) and the number of different TCRs present in an individual (the realized repertoire) can be measured. One puzzle is that the potential repertoire greatly exceeds the realized diversity of naïve T cells within any individual. We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of “evolutionary sloppiness.” Another immunological puzzle is why mice and humans have similar repertoires even though humans have over 1000-fold more T cells. We discuss how the idea of the “protecton,” the smallest unit of protection, might explain this discrepancy and estimate the size of “protecton” based on available precursor frequencies data. We then consider T cell cross-reactivity – the ability of a T cell clone to respond to more than one epitope. We extend existing calculations to estimate the extent of expected cross-reactivity between the responses to different pathogens. Our results are consistent with two observations: a low probability of observing cross-reactivity between the immune responses to two randomly chosen pathogens; and the ensemble of memory cells being sufficiently diverse to generate cross-reactive responses to new pathogens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/15fb4baf009c99e171122e915929423b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296a51f771655eafb91f8ece691bc4b3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3050e08ca235c9573c36afc2249641fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/483524807e559aef2431686a7695e5db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49a151b9eed92cecc67476988e707a4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/58381333b4e4cec19fd2aaf086c89310, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5fa69f32dc9f9745e134792e075d3e14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61fb7522087c1c0aa1a5983ef5ab6531, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6730cbd3394a21d497d921060fc897fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b51d096c59a0bedb0c10885bffc5747, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7f95f97f024a207791690d14490bea33, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/900bd20a9fff8dc20d672e9b0e69be38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/97a376d57478beb432025aba7d867552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/abbf6549d8525924d6b69230915608bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf7bd4de7034a40d3f94772cb64c229a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c61a2064d09fb35e8686c25ed08eb089, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf1772b60b82cb83252a33e290513803, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d737d448f052aaf4fed4468d2c746ef7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8834895151041ec5262352bfd5b7073, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e41d5ea87d52ecf75b4ec418b91d3eea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e7dcf0bdd63e395ff545be4e118991e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f393ac8121b0a4901baddcba44e64638, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa3810f23a917f2d2b61fc5db06ad26e"

We demonstrated that better discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks by network entropy than by other topological metrics. Moreover, we identified different dynamical interactions among TLR2, IL-1β, IL10 and NFκB between normal and inflammatory networks using optimization algorithm. In particular, good robustness and multistability of inflammatory sub-networks were discovered. Furthermore, we identified a complex, TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, which may play important roles in controlling inflammation, and demonstrated that changes in network entropy of this complex negatively correlated to those of three proteins: TNFα, NFκB and COX-2.

Findings which indicate that complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (C-ADE) is present also in HIV-infected patients, are summarized. Previous results of the authors, suggesting that C-ADE plays a very important role in the progression of HIV infection are described.

The recent discovery of a counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system composed of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas has led us to examine the role of this vasoprotective axis on such disorders. Objectives: We hypothesized that Ang-(1–7) treatment would exert protective effects against PF and PH. Methods: Lentiviral packaged Ang-(1–7) fusion gene or ACE2 cDNA was intratracheally administered into the lungs of male Sprague Dawley rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received bleomycin (2.5 mg/kg). In a subsequent study, animals were administered monocrotaline (MCT, 50 mg/kg). Measurements and Main Results: In the PF study, bleomycin administration resulted in a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which was associated with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. The lungs of these animals also exhibited excessive collagen deposition, decreased expression of ACE and ACE2, increased mRNA levels for transforming growth factor β and other proinflammatory cytokines, and increased protein levels of the AT(1)R. Overexpression of Ang-(1–7) significantly prevented all the above-mentioned pathophysiological conditions. Similar protective effects were also obtained with ACE2 overexpression. In the PH study, rats injected with MCT developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, all of which were attenuated by Ang-(1–7) overexpression. Blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1–7) against MCT-induced PH. Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate a cardiopulmonary protective role for the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis in the treatment of lung disorders.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0b8d90a913e3aa5ff942edc222c9e799, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f0020d4c5179dd21a186ae0c31f30a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f64d7f415569becc4277755bdb6871e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13591845f00efd96170ba1d54636013e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/157f697d9611dc5356e7dd609132a6e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2106d2b45bdfca2bd174690ece92dd6c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/241bcf2d1fe59b3577113008379a79a1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c9bbd8eca4014ec333f7558bac3f088, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31c0d4ea8b9d5edc1f4324e6e176bd85, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c2f47a19b21b2e38eefbc077723f049, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3cb259c03b28441249d1b8bce40d27f4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3f750c99aa049aa4c53d8dec3180126e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42acd1f41446b9d94bcf339d74c0d02d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48db53b56da2be11be7f6cf15d110ae8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e072e250a659fdefea73c8dcc266071, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/56452b7637bb0b8115424c0412cf9ecb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dada875ef4022d5f5b2800707788daf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7d63d65080229b82a04d4511e342aaf1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e4b621d4bf5972e3c080350376c8cf9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85f07865dea13f21772e80b87bc9690c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a9202b81b648510628432d370400ee0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/95a362203b1a20de82d55e4a3d87a9d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d60a712c8ef25b8c202a59dca3230dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d75d7cf476a925af6a108618159097a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6d95e4f8f136342d57a49bc6db8ebcc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7008e256c5ec8f286f072eabc2807dc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aae94d572e006b52dac6c4cd3ac8e3c1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af7106ccc5aee44fd36745a5a4022a36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b09362bc81bc26d2cfa75237151d4e11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b6d4c176f5d7b8f3f762705dbc4a7f13, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bf11240693367373911034f75d7f00c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2ff02585088ffabf919b1bd865d37f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c49d4a181a78c2553b3028a6c434b58c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cd2400c04591b981b83639d7e8c8c8bd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d28cee8f3fb0b1738c048e53e97a8e5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e525e9b95d096babb5c9a3a3e0908f88, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0c50207771ccaf7f8240f6b638631a2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4f8b86d943da055be808b62c69d1a6b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f8b66787a11c07ea90a4e1bfe2d10020, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb282737ebb586d588e1a4834406e52f"

Mixed infections with Chlamydia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may result in generation of persistent chlamydial infections. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established. RESULTS: Infected cultures were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and re-infection experiments. By IF, Chlamydia-infected cells showed normal inclusions after 39 hpi. Dual infections with Chlamydia abortus revealed a heterogenous mix of inclusion types including small inclusions consisting of aberrant bodies (ABs), medium-sized inclusions consisting of ABs and reticulate bodies and normal inclusions. Only aberrant inclusions were observable in dual infection experiments with Chlamydia pecorum and PEDV. TEM examinations of mixed infections with Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum revealed aberrant chlamydial inclusions containing reticulate-like, pleomorphic ABs, which were up to 2 μm in diameter. No re-differentiation into elementary bodies (EBs) was detected. In re-infection experiments, co-infected cells produced fewer EBs than monoinfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirm that PEDV co-infection alters the developmental cycle of member species of the family Chlamydiaceae, in a similar manner to other well-described persistence induction methods. Interestingly, this effect appears to be partially species-specific as Chlamydia pecorum appears more sensitive to PEDV co-infection than Chlamydia abortus, as evidenced by TEM and IF observations of a homogenous population of aberrant inclusions in PEDV - Chlamydia pecorum co-infections.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/032a1625d42e9e0e9deddabc4bcdd7be, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0e4dda47816d67acea3a468070282d8d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/139becd9926eb25f9a52d058b686b89d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22c8b83516ea6958eb36139428ab941c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/26fceca39114f1d33e7f2f6a12df375e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2f96fc7d85d1452c1361b44dbcbb1a11, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/37dde8a87040c1cb183b10705e16ba49, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/489c53af52d6fda02ddf6ae4e652a11a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/521c66b9b31e0df54534161464373dc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59c6e30626127edf475aadbddeaa68e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/59f42bdf5ad6f5e66f0e0963cbb68a14, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5aa2c484154d28f4fa98b1b9432deed9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b34f5ef3a595d0fbcffe23d69dbc3ce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5c6013797ffc7823b322fbc6622ea323, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5e074d4a87bab24aeeb91b25a04ea8e5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/600cd719c108eab32f810f01890375bb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/615e7525c522c371459ce324872a987b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/78c5e4463c6f3c41df636c744e67447a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7b7dc333db17db02bd7c98f07bd618fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/80b4c459de090a68f56470761606260d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88c067983f4728f48984a2cdda61099d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a4c89fab1f1a0cc424efd2f2a9f1f9ae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a710fc1367164089e385c722725a7d53, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a80e6d2853b654d0cd08c74697d580b1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa1951e8bce00ca7c99b7dc9ce72b5e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b52b41704e16f418c16b17a955406c96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c7e515967590310d06d8d7fd3f043ded, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cad8eb9cf53f55915cd015c9898831e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cdede101bb82a710749e079e9ca688c7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d15b8d2096dac8b4c73800807096ca91, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d59686c579348487d4f9fca814c4dd3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d72827b9d731f16dcb1a38607a00cd54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f354244fc1318b552ac064834da90d72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f7b05d8f87d0821439fd2227b7637926, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe9da902b88bd4ec5f005698ce8cca6d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffbb3d3cfb82a0dd6cf8a7c595105607"

Epidemiologic studies in Asian children suggest that the etiologic agent(s) of KD may be associated with environmental changes. Laboratory findings are useful for the diagnosis of incomplete KD, and they can guide the next-step in treatment of initial intravenous immunoglobulin non-responders. CALs seem to develop in the early stages of the disease before a peak in inflammation. Therefore early treatment, before the peak in inflammation, is mandatory to reduce the risk of CAL progression and severity of CALs. The immunopathogenesis of KD is more likely that of acute rheumatic fever than scarlet fever. A hypothetical pathogenesis of KD is proposed under the premise of a %22protein homeostasis system%22; where innate and adaptive immune cells control pathogenic proteins that are toxic to host cells at a molecular level. After an infection of unknown KD pathogen(s), the pathogenic proteins produced from an unknown focus, spread and bind to endothelial cells of coronary arteries as main target cells. To control the action of pathogenic proteins and/or substances from the injured cells, immune cells are activated. Initially, non-specific T cells and non-specific antibodies are involved in this reaction, while hyperactivated immune cells produce various cytokines, leading to a cytokine imbalance associated with further endothelial cell injury. After the emergence of specific T cells and specific antibodies against the pathogenic proteins, tissue injury ceases and a repair reaction begins with the immune cells.",""

Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/01f7b17c61e7eb352a25bc63948ab56b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/09385a8dc677f4d5a33aa46f4b93c5ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0c76ff360fda549bf0c6c380adcc0cdf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/168ff566914b85c954557cfce810e74e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2437ba8c60222fb9e36074d22ce46abd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29533d7df7ed2b18ca9fa171fd3867f7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/296cd9bf78157269584b5ca19681d333, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ccbdf63f63869594774ff11e2ecd6e6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c08606d6b8186aedeb6f2b4b4e928bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4621b33223f311e6cb5185cb8b5a2ad0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b9be60580afd0b28ba569ca45ebd8ee, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6652667c897af22d8f2c182ea8999e39, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/692b36d0ad73b31844211d666eb23959, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d8ff1d1faba150404cd63104e05e4e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/74a01f57188cee85e3f6de4f5cefa105, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a80dbbd95291c49845cdab8d9078b46, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/81b7f75033632a095b2bfdea1434384d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8525bc29c3dee085dbe05b8038feaed4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/854863d78e9ad6e343a53b7cb269fb68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/89bc9e24f925296f4b6ea6a30dcef046, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8d911c1093d6fe16e18212c50542621f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8db8a0f8cfb282237a3dbe8afb2e2a12, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91b529eeefde632274dd12d9e80825bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/92c2068153cb470023f6d2d095e376f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/93b87bb7d0b5c86c8e40dde6fb74fdaa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/96e5c1646790954a0357620bbc5568c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/987035c3120e9f8069c66e25cc6987ff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/996c3231b55eaa387db6d3db0eae2f92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ad7e2c31d26d005ef4b81b828b86493, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a572c10ff72cca98bb5fa9e6ed04ee99, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a5a5d651e680c85596c6a497d8c9f7fb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afde880e935fe04c57f65659a1844405, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b31f4e8636b3f4566940735e019f1b4b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b852068a6f4bdf0c81d935f298763da5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba11df54ea62a2b499b5e0951d46e5e9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be343d4a3172f2e933e88aa053c8120f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c079a24ca88b4efa38066dc16db2554d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c132a3cd8d96c7bc1adf08896b0f070f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccb948010294ccaf568a69a9d6827b68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6a49ab552525dadc7029406e7f3ceb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7ffb98711626a7003744ba33bf44a3f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/da006c891aec4961a193434ae947ceec, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1e7909810e2c2653b4479c201da60fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e3d90a3dcc7081a3710e548282954da0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe6b2e97f5806d76dc22a5617348555f"

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), III (D). Alanine substitution of the motif I residues (AA-E-D, four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2 or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low passage (P10) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multi-protein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside of ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/086dd4f0af5045d22ce91580b2b98068, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13d37b8d5fb5116457feca2710947a62, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/163ea8bc9771f76cd1989f287a47d8c3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1bb6dacd04b9e76442aefd1cc4bd7bb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/22897f798302c9626c4d5ad8c1ed4ade, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24394770c3fbe096ecc2d09784267c7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2ccda42db954aca2ab64ec046abf68fd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2cf86143361a631c59b71b79e001de94, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d0a6138f94a2d686dd3b17d2f8bae54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3017c083fd44544b4f5b1bd258adcbfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31b389da80765216e5f433810b8fbeeb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31cc5656f600f684c3b5a0cab07fab95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34736d58d2c41fe6c1facb055dec5495, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ec9ecf57104a001c1ef054fa3a3eeb2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/766b08e646a40fbdd952eb113ad20bc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a9e6fdcefa857747c7ddca78c8ba02a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8186d2f35fecd450dce30cd1ff2cdf06, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/82662945238b7ff76266302ac81f122c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/854e4aec6a31c926c45ab16ea6bfaa1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/88d8395fd6a506ce7514537d3f47f813, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a76b3a9de061f6f95a4c356466149ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8a7e2a6eb1d2b5ce45099c66c44d09d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8fdfe96a3664f871bc7e47dfc5dfd46f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/952d8b84a41029a550f3d9961bd10ea0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9dbfc23058af841447da14e5c8cad10d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9e460ffdab370e9a8ed97629af1e37ca, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a3201a4ce16718fd4fe46568643c2248, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ab045b4b361c2f12eb628a481ac53aab, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be879806e9184d39b50a86ff2a7f31fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf99a7cec344eddf395d7595dd2fd946, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e1b7e57c843639f09e69c210a9cbd351, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4c939e28f9160945bd98e8a9a8a58d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/eb4459290720a5abf7dcab5b9f7c82c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef452669b68e1bcb030968704b652078"

An essential step in membrane remodeling is membrane fission, in which an initially continuous membrane surface is divided into multiple, separate compartments. The established view has been that membrane fission requires proteins with conserved structural features such as helical scaffolds, hydrophobic insertions, and polymerized assemblies. In this review we discuss these structure-based fission mechanisms and highlight recent findings from several groups that support an alternative, structure-independent mechanism of membrane fission. This mechanism relies on lateral collisions among crowded, membrane-bound proteins to generate sufficient steric pressure to drive membrane vesiculation. As a stochastic process, this mechanism contrasts with the paradigm that deterministic protein structures are required to drive fission, raising the prospect that many more proteins may participate in fission than previously thought. Paradoxically, our recent work suggests that intrinsically disordered domains may be among the most potent drivers of membrane fission, owing to their large hydrodynamic radii and substantial chain entropy. This stochastic view of fission also suggests new roles for the structure-based fission proteins. Specifically, we hypothesize that in addition to driving fission directly, the canonical fission machines may facilitate the enrichment and organization of bulky disordered protein domains in order to promote membrane fission by locally amplifying protein crowding.",""

We have developed an agnostic analytical approach to comprehensively survey PTMs on viral and cellular RNAs. Specifically, we used mass spectrometry to analyze PTMs on total RNA isolated from cells infected with Zika virus, Dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. All five RNA viruses significantly altered global PTM landscapes. Examination of PTM profiles of individual viral genomes isolated by affinity capture revealed a plethora of PTMs on viral RNAs, which far exceeds the handful of well-characterized modifications. Direct comparison of viral epitranscriptomes identified common and virus-specific PTMs. In particular, specific dimethylcytosine modifications were only present in total RNA from virus-infected cells, and in intracellular HCV RNA, and viral RNA from Zika and HCV virions. Moreover, dimethylcytosine abundance during viral infection was modulated by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6. By opening the Pandora’s box on viral PTMs, this report presents numerous questions and hypotheses on PTM function and strongly supports PTMs as a new tier of regulation by which RNA viruses subvert the host and evade cellular surveillance systems.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03d514c11b5af3926b027af089015477, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b569bf4bfa816ee27df92a1336f9448, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/31e507713a7a32d4a6c03ecced375885, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/370ef9da357270b31751e2d9f87a6c83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3eab235796feca4ab2886cff104bfa3c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42423291b71767b0c2dcf7a7cb7ae6d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/45fe2975bfd72e38c0c0ea87c17be04b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/49641c92f37195119e4b8fff602d1a4a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c1e6ba5468af837fd6fb89d7ed27e80, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e4a7e2a6034fd8d035f494657318b95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4fcc038ad91191eded5d253dec1b5ad3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5068a00451592e05feeb565b0cb8046e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/53b0f24a4fbf0e201629e60369a9e54a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6097c0e3bcf067ed243c3336bf2864d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6b60567f8e7e8bacc71d5136b405afb9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6e849d6ea3d3d786f53d4f12fe5e06f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/70d7955c6ff4b4a80e9b8a46a5fec81a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7189298bbba128b14438265d9052f9e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/772a965ded2fad8609aad9d7012d8ebe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7e11439e3bc654ced9021392357bf7a4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8368ca398f04995f4e1a089cb32aa221, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cd56d792cd9c6de0597a79e9d1033a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9357b2edbdfe53c3b6fcaab3a2975565, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a6b556bb35c2497c11e3d5eb5a8a686, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a6c61555607fff15f704141a2c800309, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/add37a77c5c6a2f44848653a75e07844, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b050246b66fc8943f929ca0671282b7b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5d167d2c3a978b9e0ec2adb826db3fa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbc619d60e812a86bb7da78f6b060b2e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d6abe840a37c13cee50ebb9266766eae, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee0264042c9396e02cb74ac3644ba19b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f2b3f5ea08368b3d28215d467ef1b4da, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9bcb80f76bf8fe2633e7cd664bff672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f9f3e2dccd8ac38549dec7b8b08a43d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fb6cb2390b4f6ac9e727763204a8be1a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fe58f068b30ee4dd053ce66b5fab7b06"

We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies. To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations. They were panned against different HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG). Despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived IgM antibody repertoire, no enrichment for binders of Envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against RBD and sG; one of the selected monoclonal antibodies (against the RBD) was of high (nM) affinity with only few somatic mutations. These results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 compared to SARS CoV and Hendra virus. HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/02950fcd6db64cb99ed3a190cb8560ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/03b65a2ef9c920cbda2651204abd3918, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05a9ab5fd42b39b3bfc950e35ae2b94c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/073dcbabdd068732a8372e246a2b8048, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/13af383d76663eeb42740b4e8116c6db, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1dbd71a259c5edf76bebf784cb1caec1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/206ce6c36f44550a2f17a50b1311000a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/24225128a0894e7e26184c18fc971918, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/25293b0979d89ddd428053f8c2c17e38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2b0f29b73655114b42729f22c841f0e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2c5874c3a05721efd4055a9e2eadccb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d756618c97eca3fc7e55767998df95f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/33a62dc100dacb7b6e8f989bcac37de2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/34be5330f060b32f8f3e8c5e38f33513, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/366a7330f0d3e55f20bdc4e2bb0b8344, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c5f011c2fa47c20513bfc25009b055a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42873b537ad16ffa89650d335720b9eb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/43a2a0d9486488d55fb2287a21eefbfb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cd7a4dde00c51ad697c75e29e68b57d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ed1a1e9a962c7b38ef4843a22f5dad5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5092190421fd7047431f880ee0ec29f6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/509bda7d9a9644435fc6e1e39f3e6b83, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5493e4d33967a316f81111a81cf8b4e7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/61784ebc3dcc8fdbe3df0e4f709d7c92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63db42e7e83608da8bdb2e1b8a7298d1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/661663e5778b939bccb86d778a8eaa54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6638c77c853702527e48a2d822052afe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72296fdabd884f2b1d2de1dee06449d3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/72d319edfc5df9ea00ce1b85803a732f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/73b18692575d863628263b3808c2572c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/91df7d13638f3a9db3de40a2848ad1f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9509d944486aedce69cb4c98f83d4672, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a29629d03a232389874cd37932a50e3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9a90977e4bba3278f34d70dcd203d207, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9d90ac3e1fc0863f1000a4e146899cfc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a37b1761d38108a73a49a3952d81d50c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a94477216a34a44d63f276c0950c6774, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac1fae71d8b5767ae9607f6334c0063e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac29c2c30c89f2910228199bfd04b607, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acd1bb91dd3bdcc2ee3561fefecebdd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af8112eebbe1ca43a5f3ff57a0c93a1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b19c6f53414443d770839a547661181a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b5ea63c7b470e7e5a492a938c277e660, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/baf814c4b285f53fabb88e485a17b6ed, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bb6484edbfd0bac4a40175f650e402ea, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd2d790aae53c34c2436834db46ee169, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd8e04f8de85048c83b5f88687b10cd4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ccbdd71c89b6bfefa3227f45158241e4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0902e86e85df193f511b581abada2fc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d7f6b702bcfc6a0776c6c8a9bec27145, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/de6bad5d00a74ac31067e77dd897e972, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df704047400f72e5e7ae0f559ae5496e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df75f86d25b40803861aa0b57c2594cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e33621b387da890572c2671134563dd8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec39e6c9fa8a6890da75b40b3518df1b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec6e6cc56c79d7066033c2d153229a5f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/efef1247e7d5bc19b09b25911ab112d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0f9b26cd318e649a612b9ff8eb20fe4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f3082e40a2485258fff8bcf4d0ad647c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f78806355e636d334c3d8adbd0f863e3"

Gene mutations that disturb this turnover process may cause skin diseases. Human GASDERMIN A (GSDMA) is frequently silenced in gastric cancer cell lines and its overexpression has been reported to induce apoptosis. GSDMA has also been linked with airway hyperresponsiveness in genetic association studies. The function of GSDMA in the skin was deduced by dominant mutations in mouse gasdermin A3 (Gsdma3), which caused skin inflammation and hair loss. However, the mechanism for the autosomal dominance of Gsdma3 mutations and the mode of Gsdma3’s action remain unanswered. RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress. We showed that Gsdma3 is regulated by intramolecular fold-back inhibition, which is disrupted by dominant mutations in the C-terminal domain. The unmasked N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondrial via mitochondrial importer receptor Tom70, where it interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 and causes increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 as well as pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genetic mutations in the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 are gain-of-function mutations which unmask the N-terminal functional domain of Gsdma3. Gsdma3 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress through mitochondrial targeting. Since mitochondrial ROS has been shown to promote epidermal differentiation, we hypothesize that Gsdma3 regulates context-dependent response of keratinocytes to differentiation and cell death signals by impinging on mitochondria.

As a consequence of their coevolution, viruses and host cells have established complex, dynamic interactions that function either in promoting virus replication and dissemination or in host defense against invading pathogens. Thus, viral infection triggers an impressive range of proteome changes. Alterations in protein abundances, interactions, posttranslational modifications, subcellular localizations, and secretion are temporally regulated during the progression of an infection. Consequently, understanding viral infection at the molecular level requires versatile approaches that afford both breadth and depth of analysis. Mass spectrometry is uniquely positioned to bridge this experimental dichotomy. Its application to both unbiased systems analyses and targeted, hypothesis-driven studies has accelerated discoveries in viral pathogenesis and host defense. Here, we review the contributions of mass spectrometry–based proteomic approaches to understanding viral morphogenesis, replication, and assembly and to characterizing host responses to infection.",""

Rodent models for BE of palatable food permit the study of genetic and biological mechanisms. We previously used genetic mapping and transcriptome analysis to map a coding mutation in Cyfip2 associated with increased BE in the BE-prone C57BL/6NJ substrain compared to the BE-resistant C57BL/6J substrain. The increase in BE in C57BL/6NJ mice was associated with a decrease in transcription of genes enriched for myelination in the striatum. Here, we tested the hypothesis that decreasing myelin levels with the demyelinating agent cuprizone would enhance BE. Mice were treated with a 0.3% cuprizone home cage diet for two weeks. Following a three-week recovery period, mice were trained for BE in an intermittent, limited access procedure. Cuprizone induced similar weight loss in both substrains and sexes that recovered within 48 h after removal of the cuprizone diet. Surprisingly, cuprizone reduced BE in male but not female C57BL/6NJ mice while having no effect in C57BL/6J mice. Cuprizone also reduced myelin basic protein (MBP) at seven weeks post-cuprizone removal while having no effect on myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) at this time point. C57BL/6N mice also showed less MBP than C57BL/6J mice. There were no statistical interactions of Treatment with Sex on MBP levels, indicating that differences in MBP are unlikely to account for sex differences in BE. To summarize, cuprizone induced an unexpected, male-specific reduction in BE which could indicate sex-specific biological mechanisms that depend on genetic background.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7cfa60c04001f733459fd8fd55594445, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8579532743f276b12800c593b6a66af1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8b02f46ed73fb149dbaac64998efda86, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b061110fa2d48c3afdc9f425c6491226, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ba04b2d12077eef0413f4dc54d5bc2a5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0f68a9c946494780656230a83c5a9d4"

Based on these effects, we therefore postulated the hypothesis that patients with acute bronchitis would also benefit from therapy with Cineole. METHODS: As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center-study, a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis was randomly selected to participate. Over a period of 10 days, all patients were administered 3 x 200 mg of Cineole, or a respective placebo, per day. The primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarises the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. RESULTS: After 4 days of treatment it was notable, that the patient group treated with Cineole, showed significantly more improvements of the bronchitis-sum-score than those of the placebo group (p = 0.0383). The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p = 0.0001 after 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that Cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four days. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact.

This Vpu function is intrinsically linked to its channel-like structure, which enables it to interfere with homologous transmembrane structures in infected cells. Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K+ channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane. Here, we found that the efficiency of Vpu-mediated viral release is inversely correlated with membrane potential polarization. By inhibiting the background K+ currents, Vpu dissipates the voltage constraint on viral particle discharge. As a proof of concept, we show that HIV-1 release can be accelerated by externally imposed depolarization alone. Our findings identify the trigger of Vpu-mediated release as a manifestation of the general principle of depolarization-stimulated exocytosis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1292b7631603678ca466436662f7cc18, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23df88964336a31e07d4e2f4e9a35861, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2d9d7ce83d919cf9f8620dbb5f48c47d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2eb9ba274a5788e7fb17c398f913c86f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/329436c307a69d0aa07489ed52f1f6c6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/552bc31db4dccbfd02282d615212ccfe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/672ee4e796cdea613fb6b3d6fb4fbb7d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/67df32aea226b2033a82836484a6cde3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/77e0b02ab4f62c2802c09992dd3cefbd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a58c79b3ec125edae3a85d482f091482, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7e02fb290f744744fab02dc85e6d200, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/aa24f63882454b2fba194aca965af17d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b20edadf7a9a6598f2b516ca94ebadc6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b3eab67b2703c8ca80379cafeb8cbe7a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c6199d3c50fd1e438760b9a140b797ad, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dc4e93dacef444aaf154eba89b427256, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f0d02baba6a26a91990b6e81b6abaa5e"

In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today’s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/08a2458b08b676c81d75979310a2a5e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0cfe082bc82e172ab874665c6803dcc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1420adb90e4a96c3b40608d7e5ae025a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/286bcf5f248c0ca9015a724a8722c7bc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2aadc9091f1226b3054446c196ec8998, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3155dccce70bb961ccfe648b6e4e4e96, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3c8863c94596aab6b48c19c512f5a3fe, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/418cf250e60dfb597c9f771f1ae69795, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/42035fbb8428756fd73c585f3251a107, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/48de427ad55efa789621fb3fc26a32d5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c7ca3fd33a8067adcb92cc1c0f1e6f2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6ca49ae29c005b6121efaa6ec3c52a9c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7504cac4c720f1dfa793a1febb86f8ba, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c8f5fb1520c6b3335d446e06e209a52, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ed04a30c2799d55d8517d3fc167d9a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af50496086cea32c54ba36e03503b549, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/afd2dedbe134f6efd478ca0820b1b0d4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b7c029421e68f529379843287a912056, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b881c302f541edfbc3c4252862028a30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bd670d7b942a0e8cf360a94720844e32, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f311578c3b883d216156d2ab36aeceb5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f67bd51e1c97f577f1253fd6b576cbfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/fa74ea0d0b1b53f5a62f65cf25f523b5"

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) has been demonstrated to be the cause of PMWS. However, other factors are needed for full development of the syndrome, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection has been suggested to be one of them. Twenty-four conventional 5-week-old pigs were distributed in four groups: control (n = 5), PRRSV inoculated (n = 5), PCV2 inoculated (n = 7), and PRRSV and PCV2 inoculated (n = 7). The two groups inoculated with PRRSV showed growth retardation. Pigs inoculated with both PRRSV and PCV2 had increased rectal temperature. One of these pigs developed wasting, had severe respiratory distress, and died. The most important microscopic lesion in pigs inoculated with PCV2 was lymphocyte depletion with histiocytic infiltration of the lymphoid organs, more severe and in a wider range of tissues in doubly inoculated pigs. Interstitial pneumonia was observed in the three inoculated groups. PCV2 nucleic acid was found by in situ hybridization in larger amounts and in a wider range of lymphoid tissues in PRRSV- and PCV2-inoculated than in PCV2-inoculated pigs. TaqMan PCR was performed to quantify the PCV2 loads in serum during the experiment. PCV2 loads were higher in doubly inoculated pigs than in pigs inoculated with PCV2 alone. These findings indicate that severe disease can be reproduced in conventional 5-week-old pigs by inoculation of PRRSV and PCV2. Moreover, these results support the hypothesis that PRRSV infection enhances PCV2 replication.",""

Genetic evolution analysis indicates that all swine influenza viruses (SIVs) possessed full-length PA-X prior to 1985, but since then SIVs with truncated PA-X have gradually increased and become dominant, implying that truncation of this protein may contribute to the adaptation of influenza virus in pigs. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the background of a “triple-reassortment” H1N2 SIV with truncated PA-X, and evaluated their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Compared with full-length PA-X, SIV with truncated PA-X had increased viral replication in porcine cells and swine respiratory tissues, along with enhanced pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs.

Viral infections trigger anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) responses by stimulating endosomal and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). However, viruses have also evolved many strategies to counteract IFN responses. Are there intracellular danger signals that enhance immune responses to viruses? During infection, viruses place a heavy demand on the protein folding machinery of the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To survive ER stress, host cells mount an unfolded protein response (UPR) to decrease ER protein load and enhance protein-folding capacity. Viruses also directly elicit the UPR to enhance their replication. Increasing evidence supports an intersection between the host UPR and inflammation, in particular the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. The UPR directly activates pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription factors and dramatically enhances cytokine production in response to viral PRR engagement. Additionally, viral PRR engagement may stimulate specific pathways within the UPR to enhance cytokine production. Through these mechanisms, viral detection via the UPR and inflammatory cytokine production are intertwined. Consequently, the UPR response is perfectly poised to act as an infection-triggered “danger” signal.

Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs. Part of the difficulty in identifying CICs may stem from the fact that the CICs studied have been largely derived from cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors. In previous studies, we have reported the enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 is sufficient to induce CAR(+)/mPSCs transformation, which we name CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi). These transformed cells possess cancer initiating and chemoresistance potential, as well as exhibiting remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietins (ANGs) and VEGF, and enhanced angiogenic potential. Moreover, CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi) actively participated in tumor blood vessel formation and triggered a novel angiogenic mechanism, the angiopoietins/Tie2 signaling pathway. These study provide critical evidence supporting the possible origin to generate CICs, and help elucidate the pathways responsible for CICs-mediated blood vessel formation.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/035db717abc0d931f258c08f31d2b614, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/05f068bdeff479cd90469fe4344a51ef, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0ef7bd38a58317584d72b6d12e871862, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0f4ff306910266da23c6b13e29fcc07e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/1e9a58dbcb100a4b40d52ecc1adcd3e0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/23279c7fe7fb1ec85d073eb44a361737, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/27aa2edd107fd9773cca9469ee4f5cfd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a417efc0275a88cfd535a0619e93239, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36e5caf9cdeb0524491830db58bcf4f0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/410e2a47519ad2f22a6abc196f54f1dd, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/438e3d9d87f654c79b26eaba9008a0d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4aebb93fabea8f50696c5593ef1019e8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4ea390d6c8ab902c4c6e9a3bd6256186, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5a0bf837b67966309d9a4db120a6ca5d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5cb73116e8b18c9c5e40a693cf234522, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5dc007d4b21c118f0292b44952318134, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/779a9bb634f2b60ec2e6951407b62fc7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a1fca1a643c7720122431f15df990cc, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7baf6587f7633a7cd8a5677823860779, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/947e4a23a8d9a30ea82dbf8227299e75, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/9ec94395c0e2157c153871f987cb66d2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a1fa9b9c75ad5783a8e4b10108609266, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b37e882a95e37820c5d0f769daa332d6, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b673cf973bb6a3ae29443d25d7592cc3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/be803630b95bf58c1ab314e4db8676cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c2b36da2577d4366cf80dc99619b6f7f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cf2161015953476550a937c26f274390, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/dbe9882ec8a478428f3327e3cf75b084, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0147249d1b5a5aa595df1684eae98b0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e17f6525e2c43ef2803cb38b996b3a38, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e4cc849d123e52d4d1eee12126823faa, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e52034b531b60bdfd95e98212a57f550, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e8f9d6a73d9e822841ea898848cab72d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e99e0459698b7a09c80886bcfc645403, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee3e8ceef2d693854b298e76d4b89d02, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f11b030dd6a204ce6e49849b39fc301e"

N- and C-terminal domains may harbor enzymatic functions important for viral mRNA synthesis, including capping enzymes or cap-snatching endoribonucleases. In the present study, we have employed a large-scale mutagenesis approach to map functionally relevant residues in these regions. The main targets were acidic (Asp and Glu) and basic residues (Lys and Arg) known to form catalytic and binding sites of capping enzymes and endoribonucleases. A total of 149 different mutants were generated and tested in the Lassa virus replicon system. Nearly 25% of evolutionarily highly conserved acidic and basic side chains were dispensable for function of L protein in the replicon context. The vast majority of the remaining mutants had defects in both transcription and replication. Seven residues (Asp-89, Glu-102, Asp-119, Lys-122, Asp-129, Glu-180, and Arg-185) were selectively important for mRNA synthesis. The phenotype was particularly pronounced for Asp-89, Glu-102, and Asp-129, which were indispensable for transcription but could be replaced by a variety of amino acid residues without affecting genome replication. Bioinformatics disclosed the remote similarity of this region to type IIs endonucleases. The mutagenesis was complemented by experiments with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin, demonstrating dependence of viral transcription from the cellular mRNA pool. In conclusion, this paper describes an N-terminal region in L protein being important for mRNA, but not genome synthesis. Bioinformatics and cell biological experiments lend support to the hypothesis that this region could be part of a cap-snatching enzyme.",""

We conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae, vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from Casanare department in eastern Colombia. Blood-EDTA samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species. The findings according to the congruence of the three molecular markers suggest the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi (51%), T. c. marinkellei (9%), T. dionisii (13%), T. rangeli (21%), T. evansi (4%) and T. theileri (2%) among 107 positive bat specimens. Regarding the T. cruzi DTUs, we observed the presence of TcI (60%), TcII (15%), TcIII (7%), TcIV (7%) and TcBAT (11%) being the first evidence to our concern of the foreseen genotype TcBAT in Colombia.

In addition to its broad antiviral activity, GRFT is stable at high temperature and at a broad pH range, displays little toxicity and immunogenicity, and is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Native GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer that binds to viral envelope glycoproteins and has displayed mid-picomolar activity in cell-based anti-HIV assays. Previously, we have engineered and analyzed several monomeric forms of this lectin (mGRFT) with anti-HIV EC(50) values ranging up to 323 nM. Based on our previous analysis of mGRFT, we hypothesized that the orientation and spacing of the carbohydrate binding domains GRFT were key to its antiviral activity. RESULTS: Here we present data on engineered tandem repeats of mGRFT (mGRFT tandemers) with antiviral activity at concentrations as low as one picomolar in whole-cell anti-HIV assays. mGRFT tandemers were analyzed thermodynamically, both individually and in complex with HIV-1 gp120. We also demonstrate by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy that mGRFT tandemers do not aggregate HIV virions. This establishes that, although the intra-virion crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins is likely integral to their activity, the antiviral activity of these lectins is not due to virus aggregation caused by inter-virion crosslinking. CONCLUSIONS: The engineered tandemer constructs of mGRFT may provide novel and powerful agents for prevention of infection by HIV and other enveloped viruses.

As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25–36 months, 37–48 months, 49–60 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, sex, and age × sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age × sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49–60 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1.00, and the angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles were sharp. CONCLUSIONS: The thoracic radiographic parameters for the healthy cynomolgus monkey presented here should prove useful in veterinary practice, research involving non-human primate models of respiratory or cardiovascular disorders, and morphological studies on cynomolgus monkeys.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/038826486cd92eb3da94e3ec79333d30, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/36db1a18a712b9519568bb791df48f1c, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3a6191089d57522ee0e837ca6d6bb326, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3b8f6d218d8cb072e82c5a8b2ae4b322, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/5b983329c0f702fadf52dc243900de20, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6495f938a93a06679895db8ad18e4439, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/83b5ba2167b8f488e3a4d89e3f7bb7a9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0ae17270095ce448b023a534dc1de4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e632535ef595dd80e4f556231476164a"

However, utilization of modified unstable antigens may be insufficient for potent T-cell cross-presentation by APCs, a mechanism that requires high levels of the antigenic protein. Therefore, we hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine utilizing a combination of proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions of an antigen in a prime/boost regimen may provide the most efficient CTL response. To address this hypothesis, we utilized conserved proteosome-resistant influenza A virus proteins M1 and NS1. Unstable versions of these polypeptides were constructed by destroying their 3-D structure via truncations or short insertions into predicted alpha-helical structures. These modified polypeptides were stabilized in the presence of the proteosome inhibitor MG132, strongly suggesting that they are degraded via a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Importantly, with both M1 and NS1antigens, homologous DNA vaccination with a mixture of unstable and proteosome-resistant wt forms of these proteins resulted in significantly higher CTL activity than vaccination with either wt or degradable forms. The most dramatic effect was seen with NS1, where homologous immunization with a mixture of these two forms was the only regimen that produced a notable elevation of CTL response, compared to vaccination with the wt NS1. Additionally, for M1 protein, heterologous vaccination utilizing the unstable form as prime and wild type form as boost, demonstrated significant augmentation of the CTL response. These data indicate that combining proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant forms of an antigen during vaccination is advantageous.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0db982dde4118578ea318bd199a16fce, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/187fc41855f9e0e17e01909fe5cfda72, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2a896569556fe56288ab9de99ec2f6cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3dbdf36713638e79c64090e08e6118b2, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3fa5378613d831cfb7eaedbd88560b9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/410375ae0818c828c4de070df9a03fa1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4cf6078b765cfaafbe9c93b7e8281434, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/573739ac435932a768c02fb0bdfff6bf, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6119b01248ebe023ff52444a4c5c99cb, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/63ab4007c8476e44caa129660bd9c41b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ac02f229bb697f3382584c1ea40aef92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b92ff8d11d1be0ad84a5edf90ae7e50a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/bbbd1972c3c0751365a3975e50874f92, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ef2c9edfdeefe4e57797c908bef794b4"

To investigate potential changes in the oligomerization of virion-associated envelope proteins, we performed SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions but without thermal denaturation. This revealed the presence of SDS-resistant trimers of E1 in the context of cell-cultured HCV (HCVcc) as well as in the context of HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp). The formation of E1 trimers was found to depend on the coexpression of E2. To further understand the origin of E1 trimer formation, we coexpressed in bacteria the transmembrane (TM) domains of E1 (TME1) and E2 (TME2) fused to reporter proteins and analyzed the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As expected for strongly interacting TM domains, TME1–TME2 heterodimers resistant to SDS were observed. These analyses also revealed homodimers and homotrimers of TME1, indicating that such complexes are stable species. The N-terminal segment of TME1 exhibits a highly conserved GxxxG sequence, a motif that is well documented to be involved in intramembrane protein-protein interactions. Single or double mutations of the glycine residues (Gly354 and Gly358) in this motif markedly decreased or abrogated the formation of TME1 homotrimers in bacteria, as well as homotrimers of E1 in both HCVpp and HCVcc systems. A concomitant loss of infectivity was observed, indicating that the trimeric form of E1 is essential for virus infectivity. Taken together, these results indicate that E1E2 heterodimers form trimers on HCV particles, and they support the hypothesis that E1 could be a fusion protein. IMPORTANCE HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 play an essential role in virus entry into liver cells as well as in virion morphogenesis. In infected cells, these two proteins form a complex in which E2 interacts with cellular receptors, whereas the function of E1 remains poorly understood. However, recent structural data suggest that E1 could be the protein responsible for the process of fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Here we investigated the oligomeric state of HCV envelope glycoproteins. We demonstrate that E1 forms functional trimers after virion assembly and that in addition to the requirement for E2, a determinant for this oligomerization is present in a conserved GxxxG motif located within the E1 transmembrane domain. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement of E1E2 heterodimer complexes likely occurs during the assembly of HCV particles to yield a trimeric form of the E1E2 heterodimer. Gaining structural information on this trimer will be helpful for the design of an anti-HCV vaccine.",""

METHODS: Prospective study of 890 ambulatory older persons without dementia who underwent annual clinical evaluations to examine change in the rate of mobility over time. RESULTS: In a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for age, sex, and education, mobility declined about 0.12 unit/year, and higher levels of respiratory muscle strength were associated with a slower rate of mobility decline (estimate 0.043, SE 0.012, p < 0.001). Respiratory muscle strength remained associated with the rate of change in mobility even after controlling for lower extremity strength (estimate 0.036, SE 0.012, p = 0.004). In a model that included terms for respiratory muscle strength, lower extremity strength and physical activity together, all three were independent predictors of mobility decline in older persons. These associations remained significant even after controlling for body composition, global cognition, the development of dementia, parkinsonian signs, possible pulmonary disease, smoking, joint pain and chronic diseases. CONCLUSION: Respiratory muscle strength is associated with mobility decline in older persons independent of lower extremity strength and physical activity. Clinical interventions to improve respiratory muscle strength may decrease the burden of mobility impairment in the elderly.",""

Objective: We tested the hypothesis that medical students receive insufficient training on correct methods for donning and doffing PPE. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students on clinical rotations at two teaching hospitals to determine the type of training they received in PPE technique. The students performed simulations of contaminated PPE removal with fluorescent lotion on gloves and were assessed for correct PPE technique and skin and/or clothing contamination. To obtain additional information on PPE training during medical education, residents, fellows, and attending physicians completed written questionnaires on PPE training received during medical school and on knowledge of PPE protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Of 27 medical students surveyed, only 11 (41%) reported receiving PPE training, and none had received training requiring demonstration of proficiency. During simulations, 25 of 27 (92.5%) students had one or more lapses in technique and 12 (44%) contaminated their skin with fluorescent lotion. For 100 residents, fellows and attending physicians representing 67 different medical schools, only 53% reported receiving training in use of PPE and only 39% selected correct donning and doffing sequence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need for development of effective strategies to train medical students in correct use of PPE.

In contrast, the implication of intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC in diarrhea is still under debate. These strains are age dependently involved in diarrhea in children, are apparently not involved in diarrhea in adults, and can also be asymptomatic intestinal microbiota strains in children and adult. This comprehensive review analyzes the epidemiology and diagnosis and highlights recent progress which has improved the understanding of Afa/Dr DAEC pathogenesis. Here, I summarize the roles of Afa/Dr DAEC virulence factors, including Afa/Dr adhesins, flagella, Sat toxin, and pks island products, in the development of specific mechanisms of pathogenicity. In intestinal epithelial polarized cells, the Afa/Dr adhesins trigger cell membrane receptor clustering and activation of the linked cell signaling pathways, promote structural and functional cell lesions and injuries in intestinal barrier, induce proinflammatory responses, create angiogenesis, instigate epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like events, and lead to pks-dependent DNA damage. UTI-associated Afa/Dr DAEC strains, following adhesin-membrane receptor cell interactions and activation of associated lipid raft-dependent cell signaling pathways, internalize in a microtubule-dependent manner within urinary tract epithelial cells, develop a particular intracellular lifestyle, and trigger a toxin-dependent cell detachment. In response to Afa/Dr DAEC infection, the host epithelial cells generate antibacterial defense responses. Finally, I discuss a hypothetical role of intestinal Afa/Dr DAEC strains that can act as “silent pathogens” with the capacity to emerge as “pathobionts” for the development of inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal carcinogenesis.",""

The Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study is an observational cohort study designed to explore the role of the lung microbiome and genome in these two diseases. This article describes the design and rationale for the GRADS study sarcoidosis protocol. The study addresses the hypothesis that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription. The goal is to enroll 400 participants, with a minimum of 35 in each of 9 clinical phenotype subgroups prioritized by their clinical relevance to understanding of the pathobiology and clinical heterogeneity of sarcoidosis. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis undergo a baseline visit with self-administered questionnaires, chest computed tomography, pulmonary function tests, and blood and urine testing. A research or clinical bronchoscopy with a research bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed to obtain samples for genomic and microbiome analyses. Comparisons will be made by blood genomic analysis and with clinical phenotypic variables. A 6-month follow-up visit is planned to assess each participant’s clinical course. By the use of an integrative approach to the analysis of the microbiome and genome in selected clinical phenotypes, the GRADS study is powerfully positioned to inform and direct studies on the pathobiology of sarcoidosis, identify diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, and provide novel molecular phenotypes that could lead to improved personalized approaches to therapy for sarcoidosis.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/04eec3692bf9550e7844eca6c2d8757b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/06c1a04180bca527233b01e4a104014b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/0d893bc2c0653ef875d6e0fdc75cd1b5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/16ba89930a2a365737540d0745e2af54, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/29fb68f9b0b31355036b50e46552cb9a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/2bd8d03baeed46e1f3eeb82d2fba9763, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/362682380a532397b80546e6e8126400, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4051f23773413128cfa696eb53c57da8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4addb1f1e88674d7c8fea60bf0813f3e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4c3648ae038f8946a2f51d4030b7c452, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4e53fa863255003e127f27dc5b976280, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/55ad7a667b6a105613560f5f0a74d3c8, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6f277a91121b922bc1c161b1b7d08648, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/79cca0c0f61c43aa5f96d2be10b59fd1, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8304011032388a731f9a4f1d226fb033, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85f2960f15c1474b8ab5d810eeb929f9, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/8cebc72123f4f46d7d7dc2d5afa44bff, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a07e1edf11c66b9b6de95f2b8891a643, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a275619e9b6d0b09961c7dd560218c1e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/a7e31d1ee54a16f0357d607bc6dcb986, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/acd0e1297c26ce3fd0ffa95ed6944c3b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/adf8b88243c9cd879b2d159408d3db68, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/af9547e9688b2268316851a75da0b350, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b214706dee8ff6df9d2ae2d857edc6f3, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/b42f544bc14b64291f0ef9cb52da7505, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c39ac98b083435d62b2e8b3bd5ae5e4d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/c767c99a345928944241f758c31a9017, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/cee4cfe5f34eb1302e7e025dc1cc77d0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d0f623e02cd2c426e2fbdebe828a026e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d285550b3a0754fe5e34578b09e3371b, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d68fd4af5c572ad3119e104da773deb7, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/d8b95e212f3e7e11acb14628905fe885, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df00eb966684f53d66cf1d20e8b0319a, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/df4abfc0a49bd17cc4691d6dd8c8da6e, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e0500fe401873881b42a4ad2d39d702d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/e432cefa67c71369098ce71924ac7dc4, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ec84b891d39a0c8453ea2cc79baf3f3d, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ee3799ea95c10776a84f853c496c75a0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f265b37b70a21c7d5ddf64e5347bc2c5, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/f4ff0515ab56accd90f41f4eb36e0552, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/ffa7aa31f4dc0ac73e49acd9056ddf95"

The majority of norovirus outbreaks are caused by genogroup II.4 (GII.4). Novel GII.4 strains emerge every 2 to 4 years and replace older variants as the dominant norovirus. Novel variants emerge through a combination of recombination, genetic drift, and selection driven by population immunity, but the exact mechanism of how or where is not known. We detected two previously unknown novel GII.4 variants, termed GII.4 UNK1 and GII.4 UNK2, and a diverse norovirus population in fecal specimens from immunocompromised individuals with diarrhea after they had undergone bone marrow transplantation. We hypothesized that immunocompromised individuals can serve as reservoirs for novel norovirus variants. To test our hypothesis, metagenomic analysis of viral RNA populations was combined with a full-genome bioinformatic analysis of publicly available GII.4 norovirus sequences from 1974 to 2014 to identify converging sites. Variable sites were proportionally more likely to be within two amino acids (P < 0.05) of positively selected sites. Further analysis using a hypergeometric distribution indicated that polymorphic site distribution was random and its proximity to positively selected sites was dependent on the size of the norovirus genome and the number of positively selected sites.In conclusion, random mutations may have a positive impact on driving norovirus evolution, and immunocompromised individuals could serve as potential reservoirs for novel GII.4 strains. IMPORTANCE Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in the United States. Every 2 to 3 years novel norovirus variants emerge and replace dominant strains. The continual emergence of novel noroviruses is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic drift, population immunity, and recombination, but exactly how this emergence occurs remains unknown. In this study, we identified two novel GII.4 variants in immunocompromised bone marrow transplant patients. Using metagenomic and bioinformatic analysis, we showed that most genetic polymorphisms in the novel variants occur near 0 to 2 amino acids of positively selected sites, but the distribution of mutations was random; clustering of polymorphisms with positively selected sites was a result of genome size and number of mutations and positively selected sites. This study shows that immunocompromised patients can harbor infectious novel norovirus variants, and although mutations in viruses are random, they can have a positive effect on viral evolution.",""

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs.","https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/3702256085cc8409a0796f5aa39d3c77, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/4474aa0a23e1f9cf451265b58bea6ed0, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/493be25c21b0fc1bc0a5e5e900e29113, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/568a434d7afa06012c86b9ac0ba48b36, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/6d513303996b993959ed3cde4bac3dde, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7a4f2cd4e95f3386a87d646f0f9f7004, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7ad125b6b0fdaa98660422a90733c61f, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/7c807ba0f1999875a265d660a7095c95, https://krr.triply.cc/.well-known/genid/85975fa9386c968739a68928e9397a44"
