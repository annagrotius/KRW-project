"MUC1 variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) conjugated to tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) have been shown to break self-tolerance in humanized MUC1 transgenic mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface displayed L-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis we synthesized a 20-amino acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An L-Rha-cholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetraethylene glycol (TEG) as a linker. The liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the non-immunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting the proposed effect on antigen presentation. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the vaccinated mice serum recognized MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.","Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anti-cancer vaccine.","['Therefore', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'a_MUC1_VNTR_TACA-conjugate', 'can', 'be', 'successfully', 'formulated', 'into', 'a_liposome-based_anti-cancer_vaccine', '.']","Therefore , we hypothesize that a_MUC1_VNTR_TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a_liposome-based_anti-cancer_vaccine .",['a_liposome-based_anti-cancer_vaccine']
"BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that holding multiple concurrent jobs in public and private (dual practice) is common among health workers in low- as well as high-income countries. Nurses are world’s largest health professional workforce and a critical resource for achieving Universal Health Coverage. Nonetheless, little is known about nurses’ engagement with dual practice. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of the literature on nurses’ dual practice with the objective of generating hypotheses on its nature and consequences, and define a research agenda on the phenomenon. The Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological steps were followed to develop the research questions, identify relevant studies, include/exclude studies, extract the data, and report the findings. PRISMA guidelines were additionally used to conduct the review and report on results. RESULTS: Of the initial 194 records identified, a total of 35 met the inclusion criteria for nurses’ dual practice; the vast majority (65%) were peer-reviewed publications, followed by nursing magazine publications (19%), reports, and doctoral dissertations. Twenty publications focused on high-income countries, 16 on low- or middle-income ones, and two had a multi country perspective. Although holding multiple jobs not always amounted to dual practice, several ways were found for public-sector nurses to engage concomitantly in public and private employments, in regulated as well as in informal, casual fashions. Some of these forms were reported as particularly prevalent, from over 50% in Australia, Canada, and the UK, to 28% in South Africa. The opportunity to increase a meagre salary, but also a dissatisfaction with the main job and the flexibility offered by multiple job-holding arrangements, were among the reported reasons for engaging in these practices. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Limited and mostly circumstantial evidence exists on nurses’ dual practice, with the few existing studies suggesting that the phenomenon is likely to be very common and carry implications for health systems and nurses’ welfare worldwide. We offer an agenda for future research to consolidate the existing evidence and to further explore nurses’ motivation; without a better understanding of nurse dual practice, this will continue to be a largely ‘hidden’ element in nursing workforce policy and practice, with an unclear impact on the delivery of care.

"Abstract Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 strain EDL933 encodes the single chromosomal 9-O-acetylesterase NanS, and several copies of prophage-encoded 9-O-acetylesterases (NanS-p). These enzymes have recently been shown to cleave 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) to yield de-O-acetylated Neu5Ac, the latter of which may serve as a carbon and/or nitrogen source. In the current study, we investigated the NanS- and NanS-p-mediated digestion of synthetic O-acetylated neuraminic acids and bovine submaxillary glands mucin (BSM)-derived O-acetylneuraminic acids by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and nano electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nanoESI MS). Initial HPTLC analyses showed the expected activity of NanS and NanS-p variants for Neu5,9Ac2. However, all tested enzymes were unable to de-O-acetylate 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,4 Ac2) in our test system. The nanoESI MS analysis of neuraminic acids after treatment of BSM with NanS-p gave evidence that NanS-p variants of EHEC O157:H7 strain EDL933 cleave off O-acetyl groups from mono-, di-, and tri-O-acetylated Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), regardless of the carbon positions C7, C8 or C9 of the acetate esters. This enzyme activity leads to neuraminidase-accessible Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc on mucin glycans. Moreover, we could demonstrate by HPTLC analyses that recombinant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron sialidase (BTSA-His) was able to cleave Neu5Ac and Neu5,9Ac2 from BSM and that the combination of BTSA-His with both NanS-His and NanS-p-His derivatives enhanced the release of de-O-acetylated core Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc from mammalian mucin O-glycans. Growth experiments with EHEC wildtype strain EDL933, its nanS and nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant and exogenous BTSA-His in BSM demonstrated that the presence of BTSA-His enhanced growth of EDL933 and the nanS deletion mutant but not the nanS/nanS-p1a-p7 mutant. Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC colonization in the human large intestine.","Thus, we hypothesize that the expression of sialic acid O-acetylesterases with a broad specificity could be an advantage in competition with the gut microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC colonization in the human large intestine.","['Thus', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_expression', 'of', 'sialic_acid_O-acetylesterases', 'with', 'a_broad_specificity', 'could', 'be', 'an_advantage', 'in', 'competition', 'with', 'the_gut_microbiota', 'for', 'nutrients', 'and', 'facilitate', 'EHEC_colonization', 'in', 'the_human_large_intestine', '.']","Thus , we hypothesize that the_expression of sialic_acid_O-acetylesterases with a_broad_specificity could be an_advantage in competition with the_gut_microbiota for nutrients and facilitate EHEC_colonization in the_human_large_intestine .","['the_expression', 'sialic_acid_O-acetylesterases', 'a_broad_specificity', 'competition', 'the_gut_microbiota', 'nutrients', 'EHEC_colonization', 'the_human_large_intestine']"
"The digestive tract is the entry site for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). TGEV transmission can be prevented if local immunity is established with increased lymphocytes. The current parenteral mode of vaccination stimulates systemic immunity well, but it does not induce sufficient mucosal immunity. Retinoic acid (RA) plays an important role in the induction of cells that imprint gut-homing molecules. We examined whether RA assist parenteral vaccination of pigs could improve mucosal immunity. We demonstrated that elevated numbers of gut-homing CD8(+) T cells (which express α4β7 and CCR9 molecules) were presented in porcine inguinal lymph nodes and were recruited to the small intestine by RA. Intestinal mucosal immunity (IgA titre) and systemic immunity (serum IgG titre) were enhanced by RA. Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa. Porcine T-cells expressed β7 integrin and CCR9 receptors and migrated to CCL25 by a mechanism that was dependent of activation by RA-pretreated DCs, rather than direct activation by RA. Together, our results provide powerful evidence that RA can assist whole inactivated TGEV (WI-TGEV) via subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization to generate intestinal immunity, and offer new vaccination strategies against TGEV.","Therefore, we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an immature mucosal phenotype and could recruit them to the small intestinal submucosa.","['Therefore', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'RA', 'could', 'induce', 'DCs', 'to', 'form', 'an_immature_mucosal_phenotype', 'and', 'could', 'recruit', 'them', 'to', 'the_small_intestinal_submucosa', '.']","Therefore , we hypothesized that RA could induce DCs to form an_immature_mucosal_phenotype and could recruit them to the_small_intestinal_submucosa .","['RA', 'DCs', 'an_immature_mucosal_phenotype', 'the_small_intestinal_submucosa']"
"BACKGROUND: FIV infection frequently compromises pregnancy under experimental conditions and is accompanied by aberrant expression of some placental cytokines. Trophoblasts produce numerous immunomodulators that play a role in placental development and pregnancy maintenance. We hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise pregnancy. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the expression of representative pro-(TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, and GM-CSF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10); CD134, a secondary co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells (FIV primary receptor); the chemokine receptor CXCR4 (FIV co-receptor); SDF-1α, the chemokine ligand to CXCR4; and FIV gag in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. METHODS: We used an anti-cytokeratin antibody in immunohistochemistry to identify trophoblasts selectively, collected these cells using laser capture microdissection, and extracted total RNA from the captured cell populations. Real time, reverse transcription-PCR was used to quantify gene expression. RESULTS: We detected IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, and CXCR4 in trophoblasts from early-and late-term pregnancy. Expression of cytokines increased from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. A clear, pro-inflammatory microenvironment was not evident in trophoblasts from FIV-infected queens at either stage of pregnancy. Reproductive failure was accompanied by down-regulation of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. CD134 was not detected in trophoblasts, and FIV gag was detected in only one of ten trophoblast specimens collected from FIV-infected queens. CONCLUSION: Feline trophoblasts express an array of pro-and anti-inflammatory immunomodulators whose expression increases from early to late pregnancy in normal tissues. Non-viable pregnancies were associated with decreased expression of immunomodulators which regulate trophoblast invasion in other species. The detection of FIV RNA in trophoblasts was rare, suggesting that the high rate of reproductive failure in FIV-infected queens was not a direct result of viral replication in trophoblasts. The influence of placental immune cells on trophoblast function and pregnancy maintenance in the FIV-infected cat requires additional study.","We hypothesized that FIV infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast immunomodulator expression, and aberrant expression of these molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise pregnancy.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'FIV_infection', 'may', 'cause', 'dysregulation', 'of', 'trophoblast_immunomodulator_expression', ',', 'and', 'aberrant_expression', 'of', 'these_molecules', 'may', 'potentiate', 'inflammation', 'and', 'compromise_pregnancy', '.']","We hypothesized that FIV_infection may cause dysregulation of trophoblast_immunomodulator_expression , and aberrant_expression of these_molecules may potentiate inflammation and compromise_pregnancy .","['FIV_infection', 'dysregulation', 'trophoblast_immunomodulator_expression', 'aberrant_expression', 'these_molecules', 'inflammation', 'compromise_pregnancy']"
"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging global health threat that produces debilitating arthritis in people. Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high- and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro. The discordant high-fidelity phenotypes in this study highlight the complexity of inferring replication fidelity indirectly from population diversity.","Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV.","['Both_high-_and_low-fidelity_mutations', 'were', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'attenuate', 'CHIKV_arthritic_disease', ',', 'replication', ',', 'and', 'neutralizing', 'antibody_levels', 'compared', 'to', 'wild-type_(WT)_CHIKV', '.']","Both_high-_and_low-fidelity_mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV_arthritic_disease , replication , and neutralizing antibody_levels compared to wild-type_(WT)_CHIKV .","['Both_high-_and_low-fidelity_mutations', 'CHIKV_arthritic_disease', 'replication', 'antibody_levels', 'wild-type_(WT)_CHIKV']"
"ABSTRACT Health problems can be thought of as phenotypic expressions of the complex relationships between genes, environments, and phenomes as a whole. Detailed evaluations of phenotypic expressions of illness are required to characterize important biological outcomes. We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone. This cross-sectional study was carried out on a dairy calf ranch in the northwestern United States from June to September 2017 and focused on calves ≤90 d of age. Comparisons were made between causes of death based on 3 levels of information: on-farm treatment records alone, necropsy-based postmortem analyses in addition to treatment records, and Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WADDL) results in addition to all other information. A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, of which 122 cases were submitted to WADDL. Necropsy- and WADDL-derived mortality phenotypes were in almost perfect agreement (Cohen's κ = 0.86) when broadly categorized as diarrhea, respiratory, diarrhea and respiratory combined, or other causes. The level of agreement between on-farm treatment records and postmortem-derived results was low and varied by the level of diagnostic detail provided. There was just fair agreement (κ = 0.22) between treatment-based and necropsy-based phenotypes without WADDL input and only slight agreement (κ = 0.13) between treatment-based and corresponding necropsy-based phenotypes with WADDL input. Even for those cases in which causes of death aligned along a comparable pathologic spectrum, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death failed to identify meaningful target areas for intervention. This was especially apparent for numerous cases of necrotizing enteritis and typhlitis (cecal inflammation) that were variously categorized as diarrhea and pneumonia by treatment-based diagnoses. The specificity of these lesions stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis and highlighted the value of on-farm necropsies and laboratory-based diagnostics to (1) detect antemortem disease misclassifications, (2) provide detail regarding disease processes and mortality phenotypes, and (3) direct disease mitigation strategies.",We hypothesized that classifying dairy calf mortality phenotypes via a systematic postmortem analysis would identify different cause-of-death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'classifying', 'dairy_calf_mortality_phenotypes', 'via', 'a_systematic_postmortem_analysis', 'would', 'identify', 'different', 'cause', '-', 'of', '-', 'death', 'diagnoses', 'than', 'those', 'derived', 'from', 'treatments', 'alone', '.']",We hypothesized that classifying dairy_calf_mortality_phenotypes via a_systematic_postmortem_analysis would identify different cause - of - death diagnoses than those derived from treatments alone .,"['dairy_calf_mortality_phenotypes', 'a_systematic_postmortem_analysis', 'cause', 'death', 'diagnoses', 'treatments']"
"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is the most important endemic pathogen in the U.S. swine industry. Despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. One of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity. Here, we quantify the co-circulation, emergence and sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages in a single swine-producing region in the United States over a span of 9 years (2009–2017). By classifying over 4,000 PRRSV sequences (open-reading frame 5) into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages, we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the PRRSV population, including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008. In addition, lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010, but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014, coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage. The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage. As host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant, this dominant (sub-) lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible. An analysis of patterns of non- synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome, further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus. This has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV that have negative impacts on the swine industry. Constant surveillance on PRRSV occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages. Further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous PRRS viruses could shed further light on PRRSV immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact.","The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage.","['The_sequential_dominance', 'of', 'different_lineages', ',', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'three_different_sub-lineages', 'within', 'lineage', '1', ',', 'is', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_immune-mediated_selection_hypothesis', 'for', 'the_sequential_turnover', 'in', 'the_dominant_lineage', '.']","The_sequential_dominance of different_lineages , as well as three_different_sub-lineages within lineage 1 , is consistent with the_immune-mediated_selection_hypothesis for the_sequential_turnover in the_dominant_lineage .","['The_sequential_dominance', 'different_lineages', 'three_different_sub-lineages', 'lineage', 'the_sequential_turnover', 'the_dominant_lineage']"
"The need for multidisciplinary research to address today's complex health and environmental challenges has never been greater. The One Health (OH) approach to research ensures that human, animal, and environmental health questions are evaluated in an integrated and holistic manner to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions than would be possible with siloed approaches. However, the OH approach is complex, and there is limited guidance available for investigators regarding the practical design and implementation of OH research. In this paper we provide a framework to guide researchers through conceptualizing and planning an OH study. We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods. We illustrate these concepts through the presentation of a case study of health impacts associated with land application of biosolids. Finally, we discuss opportunities for applying an OH approach to identify solutions to current global health issues, and the need for cross-disciplinary funding sources to foster an OH approach to research.","We discuss key steps in designing an OH study, including conceptualization of hypotheses and study aims, identification of collaborators for a multi-disciplinary research team, study design options, data sources and collection methods, and analytical methods.","['We', 'discuss', 'key_steps', 'in', 'designing', 'an_OH_study', ',', 'including', 'conceptualization', 'of', 'hypotheses', 'and', 'study_aims', ',', 'identification', 'of', 'collaborators', 'for', 'a_multi-disciplinary_research_team', ',', 'study_design_options', ',', 'data_sources', 'and', 'collection_methods', ',', 'and', 'analytical_methods', '.']","We discuss key_steps in designing an_OH_study , including conceptualization of hypotheses and study_aims , identification of collaborators for a_multi-disciplinary_research_team , study_design_options , data_sources and collection_methods , and analytical_methods .","['an_OH_study', 'conceptualization', 'hypotheses', 'study_aims', 'identification', 'collaborators', 'a_multi-disciplinary_research_team', 'study_design_options', 'data_sources', 'collection_methods', 'analytical_methods']"

"BACKGROUND: In recent years, novel hepadnaviruses, hepeviruses, hepatoviruses, and hepaciviruses have been discovered in various species of bat around the world, indicating that bats may act as natural reservoirs for these hepatitis viruses. In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China. METHODS: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses.

"We hypothesized that postnatal development of the vagina is impacted by early nutritional environment. Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between postnatal gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h after birth, with or without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) suckled by sow (S, n = 8); 2) suckled by sow plus administration of a fat supplement (SF, n = 5); 3) bottle-fed solely milk replacer (B, n = 8); or 4) bottle-fed solely milk replacer plus administration of a fat supplement (BF, n = 7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r > 0.6; p < 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p < 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts.

"Dengue viruses (DENV) are the causative agents of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Here we review the current state of knowledge about the human antibody response to dengue and identify important knowledge gaps. A large body of work has demonstrated that antibodies can neutralize or enhance DENV infection. Investigators have mainly used mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to study interactions between DENV and antibodies. These studies indicate that antibody neutralization of DENVs is a “multi-hit” phenomenon that requires the binding of multiple antibodies to neutralize a virion. The most potently neutralizing mouse MAbs bind to surface exposed epitopes on domain III of the dengue envelope (E) protein. One challenge facing the dengue field now is to extend these studies with mouse MAbs to better understand the human antibody response. The human antibody response is complex as it involves a polyclonal response to primary and secondary infections with 4 different DENV serotypes. Here we review studies conducted with immune sera and MAbs isolated from people exposed to dengue infections. Most dengue-specific antibodies in human immune sera are weakly neutralizing and bind to multiple DENV serotypes. The human antibodies that potently and type specifically neutralize DENV represent a small fraction of the total DENV-specific antibody response. Moreover, these neutralizing antibodies appear to bind to novel epitopes including complex, quaternary epitopes that are only preserved on the intact virion. These studies establish that human and mouse antibodies recognize distinct epitopes on the dengue virion. The leading theory proposed to explain the increased risk of severe disease in secondary cases is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which postulates that weakly neutralizing antibodies from the first infection bind to the second serotype and enhance infection of FcγR bearing myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages. Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis. By understanding how human antibodies neutralize or enhance DENV, it will be possible to better evaluate existing vaccines and develop the next generation of novel vaccines.","Here we review results from human, animal and cell culture studies relevant to the ADE hypothesis.","['Here', 'we', 'review', 'results', 'from', 'human,_animal_and_cell_culture_studies', 'relevant', 'to', 'the_ADE_hypothesis', '.']","Here we review results from human,_animal_and_cell_culture_studies relevant to the_ADE_hypothesis .","['results', 'human,_animal_and_cell_culture_studies']"
"Abstract We have tested the hypothesis that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus protein E (SCoVE) and its homologs in other coronaviruses associate through their putative transmembrane domain to form homooligomeric α-helical bundles in vivo. For this purpose, we have analyzed the results of molecular dynamics simulations where all possible conformational and aggregational space was systematically explored. Two main assumptions were considered; the first is that protein E contains one transmembrane α-helical domain, with its N- and C-termini located in opposite faces of the lipid bilayer. The second is that protein E forms the same type of transmembrane oligomer and with identical backbone structure in different coronaviruses. The models arising from the molecular dynamics simulations were tested for evolutionary conservation using 13 coronavirus protein E homologous sequences. It is extremely unlikely that if any of our assumptions were not correct we would find a persistent structure for all the sequences tested. We show that a low energy dimeric, trimeric and two pentameric models appear to be conserved through evolution, and are therefore likely to be present in vivo. In support of this, we have observed only dimeric, trimeric, and pentameric aggregates for the synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS protein E in SDS. The models obtained point to residues essential for protein E oligomerization in the life cycle of the SARS virus, specifically N15. In addition, these results strongly support a general model where transmembrane domains transiently adopt many aggregation states necessary for function.",Abstract We have tested the hypothesis that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus protein E (SCoVE) and its homologs in other coronaviruses associate through their putative transmembrane domain to form homooligomeric α-helical bundles in vivo.,"['Abstract', 'We', 'have', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome', '(SARS)_coronavirus_protein_E_(SCoVE', ')', 'and', 'its_homologs', 'in', 'other_coronaviruses', 'associate', 'through', 'their_putative_transmembrane_domain', 'to', 'form', 'homooligomeric_α-helical_bundles', 'in', 'vivo', '.']",Abstract We have tested the_hypothesis that severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome (SARS)_coronavirus_protein_E_(SCoVE ) and its_homologs in other_coronaviruses associate through their_putative_transmembrane_domain to form homooligomeric_α-helical_bundles in vivo .,"['Abstract', 'the_hypothesis', 'severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome', '(SARS)_coronavirus_protein_E_(SCoVE', 'its_homologs', 'other_coronaviruses', 'their_putative_transmembrane_domain', 'homooligomeric_α-helical_bundles', 'vivo']"
"BASIGIN/CD147/EMMPRIN is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein strongly expressed in tumours. BASIGIN controls tumour metabolism, particularly glycolysis by facilitating lactic acid export through the two monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4. However, before being recognized as a co-carrier of MCTs, BASIGIN was described as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Early on, a model emerged in which, tumour cells use the extracellular domain of BASIGIN to recognize and stimulate neighbouring fibroblasts to produce MMPs. However, this model has remained hypothetical since a direct link between BASIGIN and MMPs production has not yet been clearly established. To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma. By using co-culture experiments of either human or mouse fibroblasts and tumour cell lines we showed, contrary to what has been abundantly published, that the disruption of BASIGIN in tumour cells and in MEFs has no action on the production of MMPs. Our findings do not support the notion that the pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated via induction of MMPs. Therefore, we propose that to date, the strongest pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated through the control of fermentative glycolysis.","To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma.","['To', 'validate', 'the_BASIGIN/MMP_hypothesis', ',', 'we', 'developed', 'BASIGIN_knockouts', 'in', 'three_human_tumour_cell_lines', 'derived', 'from', 'glioma', ',', 'colon', ',', 'and', 'lung_adenocarcinoma', '.']","To validate the_BASIGIN/MMP_hypothesis , we developed BASIGIN_knockouts in three_human_tumour_cell_lines derived from glioma , colon , and lung_adenocarcinoma .","['the_BASIGIN/MMP_hypothesis', 'BASIGIN_knockouts', 'three_human_tumour_cell_lines', 'glioma', 'colon', 'lung_adenocarcinoma']"
"BACKGROUND: The study of Onchocerca volvulus has been limited by its host range, with only humans and non-human primates shown to be susceptible to the full life cycle infection. Small animal models that support the development of adult parasites have not been identified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We hypothesized that highly immunodeficient NSG mice would support the survival and maturation of O. volvulus and alteration of the host microenvironment through the addition of various human cells and tissues would further enhance the level of parasite maturation. NSG mice were humanized with: (1) umbilical cord derived CD34(+) stem cells, (2) fetal derived liver, thymus and CD34(+) stem cells or (3) primary human skeletal muscle cells. NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.

"Low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for many RNA virus mutators have been shown to confer attenuated phenotypes, presumably due to increased mutation rates. Additionally, for many RNA viruses, replication to high titers results in the production of defective interfering particles (DIs) that also attenuate infection. We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked. We show that a Sindbis virus mutator replicating at a high multiplicity of infection manifests an earlier and greater accumulation of DIs than its wild-type counterpart. The isolated DIs interfere with the replication of full-length virus in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, the ability of the mutator virus to overproduce DIs could be linked to an increased recombination frequency. These data confirm that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fidelity and recombination are inversely correlated for this mutator. Our findings suggest that defective interference resulting from higher recombination rates may be more detrimental to RNA virus mutators than the increase in mutational burden. IMPORTANCE Replication, adaptation, and evolution of RNA viruses rely in large part on their low-fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses artificially modified in their polymerases to decrease fidelity (mutator viruses) are attenuated in vivo, demonstrating the important role of fidelity in viral fitness. However, attenuation was attributed solely to the modification of the viral mutation rate and the accumulation of detrimental point mutations. In this work, we described an additional phenotype of mutator viruses: an increased recombination rate leading to defective interfering particle (DI) overproduction. Because DIs are known for their inhibitory effect on viral replication, our work suggests that fidelity variants may be attenuated in vivo via several mechanisms. This has important implications in the development of fidelity variants as live attenuated vaccine strains.","We hypothesized that fidelity, recombination, and DI production are tightly linked.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'fidelity', ',', 'recombination', ',', 'and', 'DI_production', 'are', 'tightly', 'linked', '.']","We hypothesized that fidelity , recombination , and DI_production are tightly linked .","['fidelity', 'recombination', 'DI_production']"
"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli serogroup O157:H7 has emerged as an important zoonotic bacterial pathogen, causing a range of symptoms from self-limiting bloody diarrhea to severe hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in humans. Beef and dairy cattle are considered the most important animal reservoirs for this pathogen. One of the important virulence characteristics of E. coli O157:H7 is the eaeA gene encoding the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. Intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. RESULTS: Cattle were orally inoculated with either milk (control), milk with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (vector), or milk with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin (vaccinated) on days 0, 14 and 28. On day 98, all calves were challenged orally with E. coli O157:H7 to evaluate whether vaccination with the recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin would reduce the level of E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding. During the first 28 days, vaccinated calves shed both the vector strain and the intimin-expressing S. Dublin strain at a similar level. The vector strain was shed for a significantly longer period as compared to the level of recombinant vaccine strain. Calves that received the intimin-expressed vaccine ceased shedding S. Dublin from day 28 to day 63. All calves were challenged with E. coli O157:H7 on day 98 to determine the effect on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. The amount of E. coli O157:H7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge. We observed a transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 from the feces in the vaccinated calves. The magnitude of fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal IgA. CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with live attenuated recombinant S. Dublin expressing intimin reduced enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7. However, the transient clearance of E. coli O157:H7 was not associated with an enhanced IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.",The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an adaptive mucosal immune response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric colonization and fecal shedding of E. coli O157:,"['The_present_study', 'was', 'undertaken', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'an_adaptive_mucosal_immune_response', 'directed', 'against', 'intimin', 'will', 'reduce', 'or', 'prevent', 'enteric_colonization', 'and', 'fecal_shedding', 'of', 'E._coli_O157', ':']",The_present_study was undertaken to test the_hypothesis that an_adaptive_mucosal_immune_response directed against intimin will reduce or prevent enteric_colonization and fecal_shedding of E._coli_O157 :,"['The_present_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'intimin', 'enteric_colonization', 'fecal_shedding', 'E._coli_O157']"
"Assembly of virus capsids and surface proteins must be regulated to ensure that the resulting complex is an infectious virion. In this review, we examine assembly of virus capsids, focusing on hepatitis B virus and bacteriophage MS2, and formation of glycoproteins in the alphaviruses. These systems are structurally and biochemically well-characterized and are simplest-case paradigms of self-assembly. Published data suggest that capsid and glycoprotein assembly is subject to allosteric regulation, that is regulation at the level of conformational change. The hypothesis that allostery is a common theme in viruses suggests that deregulation of capsid and glycoprotein assembly by small molecule effectors will be an attractive antiviral strategy, as has been demonstrated with hepatitis B virus.","The hypothesis that allostery is a common theme in viruses suggests that deregulation of capsid and glycoprotein assembly by small molecule effectors will be an attractive antiviral strategy, as has been demonstrated with hepatitis B virus.","['The_hypothesis', 'that', 'allostery', 'is', 'a_common_theme', 'in', 'viruses', 'suggests', 'that', 'deregulation', 'of', 'capsid_and_glycoprotein_assembly', 'by', 'small_molecule_effectors', 'will', 'be', 'an_attractive_antiviral_strategy', ',', 'as', 'has', 'been', 'demonstrated', 'with', 'hepatitis_B_virus', '.']","The_hypothesis that allostery is a_common_theme in viruses suggests that deregulation of capsid_and_glycoprotein_assembly by small_molecule_effectors will be an_attractive_antiviral_strategy , as has been demonstrated with hepatitis_B_virus .","['The_hypothesis', 'allostery', 'a_common_theme', 'viruses', 'deregulation', 'small_molecule_effectors', 'hepatitis_B_virus']"
"BACKGROUND: Practice of meditation or exercise may enhance health to protect against acute infectious illness. OBJECTIVE: To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness. DESIGN: Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: Madison, Wisconsin, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. METHODS: 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise (EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October, with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence, duration, and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism, health care utilization, and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. RESULTS: Of 413 participants randomized, 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group, 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers, 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 244, 386), 256 (193, 318) for EX, and 336 (268, 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR (p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX (p = 0.042), compared to control, not quite attaining the p<0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group, 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers, and 105 days and 24 visits among controls. Viruses were identified in 63 ARI episodes in the MBSR group, compared to 64 for EX and 72 for control. Statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in general mental health, self-efficacy, mindful attention, sleep quality, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBSR and/or EX groups, compared to control.

"CLEC4M is a C-type lectin gene serving as cell adhesion receptor and pathogen recognition receptor. It recognizes several pathogens of important public health concern. In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.",Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.,"['Our_findings', 'do', 'not', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_origin', 'of', 'the_VNTR_alleles', 'were', 'arisen', 'by', 'independent_(separate)_mutation_events', 'and', 'caused', 'by', 'differential_allele_advantage', 'and', 'natural_selection', 'as', 'suggested', 'by', 'previous_report', 'based', 'on', 'SNP_data', '.']",Our_findings do not support the_hypothesis that the_origin of the_VNTR_alleles were arisen by independent_(separate)_mutation_events and caused by differential_allele_advantage and natural_selection as suggested by previous_report based on SNP_data .,"['Our_findings', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_origin', 'the_VNTR_alleles', 'independent_(separate)_mutation_events', 'differential_allele_advantage', 'natural_selection', 'previous_report', 'SNP_data']"
"BACKGROUND: Increased bone marrow lipid deposition in steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) implies that abnormalities in fat metabolism play an important role in ON development. The increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that there might be a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. METHODS: ON rabbit model was induced based on our established protocol. Dynamic-MRI was employed for local intra-osseous perfusion evaluation in bilateral femora. Two weeks after induction, bone marrow was harvested for evaluating the ability of adipogenic differentiation of marrow MSCs at both cellular and mRNA level involving adipogenesis-related gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARγ2). The bilateral femora were dissected for examining marrow lipid deposition by quantifying fat cell number, fat cell size, lipid deposition area and ON lesions. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON occurrence, the rabbits were divided into ON(+ )(with at least one ON lesion) group and ON(- )(without ON lesion) group. For investigating association among adipogenesis, lipid deposition and perfusion function with regard to ON extension, the ON(+ )rabbits were further divided into sub-single-lesion group (SON group: with one ON lesion) and sub-multiple-lesion group (MON group: with more than one ON lesion). RESULTS: Local intra-osseous perfusion index was found lower in either ON(+ )or MON group when compared to either ON(- )or SON group, whereas the marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON(+ )or MON group as compared with ON(- )and SON group. The adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPARγ2 expression in either ON(+ )or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON(- )or SON group.

"Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV) has been recently recognized as a potential agent of nosocomial viral respiratory infections (NRVI) in high-risk infants. We have confirmed this as fact through the study of a 1-year period of HCoV outbreaks occurring during a prospective survey of NRVI in a paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit (PNICU) using new molecular techniques for HCoV detection. Nasal samples obtained at admission and weekly thereafter for all hospitalised children, as well as monthly nasal samples from staff, were analysed using immunofluorescence for respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, paramyxoviruses 1, 2, 3 and adenoviruses. RT-PCR was used for HCoV detection. During the year 1998, 43 HCoV-related NRVI were detected in 152 neonates (incidence 28.3%), and 7 HCoV-related NRVI were found in 92 children (incidence 7.6%). Three HCoV-related outbreaks were observed (February, August and December), associated with a high prevalence of HCoV infection in the staff. During the August outbreak, 50% to 78% of hospitalised neonates and children were infected. Seventy-five percent of hospitalised preterm neonates with a gestational age less than 32 weeks and 52.4% of staff members were infected. Risk factors for NRVI in neonates were birth weight, gestational age, ventilation, oxygenation and hospitalisation length. Ninety-two percent of infected preterm neonates were symptomatic, mainly with bradycardia and respiratory worsening. These data provide additional evidence for a possibly significant role of HCoV in NRVI in a PNICU.

"Abstract Objectives The role of bacteria in acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) of adults and interactions with viral infections is incompletely understood. This study tested the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and illness severity. Methods Two groups of 97 specimens each were randomly selected from multiplex-PCR identified virus-positive and virus-negative nasal specimens obtained from adults with new onset ARI, and 40 control specimens were collected from healthy adults. All specimens were analyzed for Haemophilus influenzae(HI), Moraxella catarrhalis(MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae(SP) by quantitative-PCR. General linear models tested for relationships between respiratory pathogens, biomarkers (nasal wash neutrophils and CXCL8), and ARI-severity. Results Nasal specimens from adults with ARIs were more likely to contain bacteria (37% overall; HI = 28%, MC = 14%, SP = 7%) compared to specimens from healthy adults (5% overall; HI = 0%, MC = 2.5%, SP = 2.5%; p < 0.001). Among ARI specimens, bacteria were more likely to be detected among virus-negative specimens compared to virus-positive specimens (46% vs. 27%; p = 0.0046). The presence of bacteria was significantly associated with increased CXCL8 and neutrophils, but not increased symptoms. Conclusion Pathogenic bacteria were more often detected in virus-negative ARI, and also associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers. These findings suggest the possibility that bacteria may augment virus-induced ARI and contribute to airway inflammation.",This study tested the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and illness severity.,"['This_study', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'bacterial_co-infection', 'during', 'ARI', 'adds', 'to', 'airway_inflammation', 'and', 'illness_severity', '.']",This_study tested the_hypothesis that bacterial_co-infection during ARI adds to airway_inflammation and illness_severity .,"['This_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'bacterial_co-infection', 'ARI', 'airway_inflammation', 'illness_severity']"
"BACKGROUND: Neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial swine herds, previously regarded to be uncomplicated to treat. However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). RESULTS: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study supported the hypothesis that a new neonatal porcine diarrhoea was present in the investigated herds, since no known pathogen(s) or management factors could explain the diarrhoeal outbreaks. Based on the findings in the four herds the following case-definition of NNPDS was suggested: Non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the first week of life, without detection of known infectious pathogens, characterized by milk-filled stomachs and flaccid intestines at necropsy.","The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome.","['The_primary_purpose', 'of', 'this_study', 'was', 'to', 'evaluate', 'if', 'well-known_enteric_pathogens', 'could', 'be', 'associated', 'with', 'outbreaks', 'of', 'neonatal_diarrhoea', ',', 'thus', 'question', 'the_hypotheses', 'of', 'a_new_syndrome', '.']","The_primary_purpose of this_study was to evaluate if well-known_enteric_pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal_diarrhoea , thus question the_hypotheses of a_new_syndrome .","['The_primary_purpose', 'this_study', 'well-known_enteric_pathogens', 'outbreaks', 'neonatal_diarrhoea', 'a_new_syndrome']"
"BACKGROUND: Chlamydiae induce persistent infections, which have been associated with a wide range of chronic diseases in humans and animals. Mixed infections with Chlamydia and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may result in generation of persistent chlamydial infections. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established. RESULTS: Infected cultures were investigated by immunofluorescence (IF), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and re-infection experiments. By IF, Chlamydia-infected cells showed normal inclusions after 39 hpi. Dual infections with Chlamydia abortus revealed a heterogenous mix of inclusion types including small inclusions consisting of aberrant bodies (ABs), medium-sized inclusions consisting of ABs and reticulate bodies and normal inclusions. Only aberrant inclusions were observable in dual infection experiments with Chlamydia pecorum and PEDV. TEM examinations of mixed infections with Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pecorum revealed aberrant chlamydial inclusions containing reticulate-like, pleomorphic ABs, which were up to 2 μm in diameter. No re-differentiation into elementary bodies (EBs) was detected. In re-infection experiments, co-infected cells produced fewer EBs than monoinfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we confirm that PEDV co-infection alters the developmental cycle of member species of the family Chlamydiaceae, in a similar manner to other well-described persistence induction methods. Interestingly, this effect appears to be partially species-specific as Chlamydia pecorum appears more sensitive to PEDV co-infection than Chlamydia abortus, as evidenced by TEM and IF observations of a homogenous population of aberrant inclusions in PEDV - Chlamydia pecorum co-infections.","To test this hypothesis, an in vitro model of dual infection with cell culture-adapted PEDV and Chlamydia abortus or Chlamydia pecorum in Vero cells was established.","['To', 'test', 'this_hypothesis', ',', 'an_in_vitro_model', 'of', 'dual_infection', 'with', 'cell_culture-adapted_PEDV', 'and', 'Chlamydia_abortus', 'or', 'Chlamydia_pecorum', 'in', 'Vero_cells', 'was', 'established', '.']","To test this_hypothesis , an_in_vitro_model of dual_infection with cell_culture-adapted_PEDV and Chlamydia_abortus or Chlamydia_pecorum in Vero_cells was established .","['an_in_vitro_model', 'dual_infection', 'cell_culture-adapted_PEDV', 'Chlamydia_abortus', 'Chlamydia_pecorum', 'Vero_cells']"
"BACKGROUND: The current standard care therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection consists of two regimes, namely interferon-based and interferon-free treatments. The treatment through the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon is expensive, only mildly effective, and is associated with severe side effects. In 2011, two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs, boceprevir and telaprevir, were licensed that have shown enhanced sustained virologic response (SVR) in phase III clinical trial, however, these interferon-free treatments are more sensitive to HCV genotype 1 infection. The variable nature of HCV, and the limited number of inhibitors developed thus aim in expanding the repertoire of available drug targets, resulting in targeting the virus assembly therapeutically. AIM: We conducted this study to predict the 3D structure of the p7 protein from the HCV genotypes 3 and 4. Approximately 63 amino acid residues encoded in HCV render this channel sensitive to inhibitors, making p7 a promising target for novel therapies. HCV p7 protein forms a small membrane known as viroporin, and is essential for effective self-assembly of large channels that conduct cation assembly and discharge infectious virion particles. METHOD: In this study, we screened drugs and flavonoids known to disrupt translation and production of HCV proteins, targeted against the active site of p7 residues of HCV genotype 3 (GT3) (isolatek3a) and HCV genotype 4a (GT4) (isolateED43). Furthermore, we conducted a quantitative structure–activity relationship and docking interaction study. RESULTS: The drug NB-DNJ formed the highest number of hydrogen bond interactions with both modeled p7 proteins with high interaction energy, followed by BIT225. A flavonoid screen demonstrated that Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), nobiletin, and quercetin, have more binding modes in GT3 than in GT4. Thus, the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential. This structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds, confirming p7 as a new target in the rapidly increasing era of HCV.","We hypothesize that the inhibitors of viral p7 identified in this screen may be a new class of potent agents, but further confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_inhibitors', 'of', 'viral_p7', 'identified', 'in', 'this_screen', 'may', 'be', 'a_new_class', 'of', 'potent_agents', ',', 'but', 'further_confirmation', 'in', 'vitro', 'and', 'in', 'vivo', 'is', 'essential', '.']","We hypothesize that the_inhibitors of viral_p7 identified in this_screen may be a_new_class of potent_agents , but further_confirmation in vitro and in vivo is essential .","['the_inhibitors', 'viral_p7', 'a_new_class', 'potent_agents', 'further_confirmation', 'vitro', 'vivo']"
"Paramyxovirus infections can be detected worldwide with some emerging zoonotic viruses and currently there are no specific therapeutic treatments or vaccines available for many of these diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from the two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of paramyxovirus fusion proteins could be used as inhibitors of virus fusion. The mechanism underlying this activity is in accordance with that of class I virus fusion proteins, of which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus fusion proteins are members. For class I virus fusion proteins, the HR1 fragment binds to HR2 to form a six-helix bundle with three HR1 fragments forming the central coiled bundle surrounded by three coiled HR2 fragments in the post fusion conformational state (fusion core). It is hypothesized that the introduced exogenous HR1 or HR2 can compete against their endogenous counterparts, which results in fusion inhibition. Using Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model, we designed several protein inhibitors, denoted HR212 as well asHR121 and 5-Helix, which could bind the HR1 or HR2 region of fusion protein, respectively. All the proteins were expressed and purified using a GST-fusion expression system in Escherichia coli. The HR212 or GST-HR212 protein, which binds the HR1 peptide in vitro, displayed inhibitory activity against NDV-mediated cell fusion, while the HR121 and 5-Helix proteins, which bind the HR2 peptide in vitro, inhibited virus fusion from the avirulent NDV strain when added before the cleavage of the fusion protein. These results showed that the designed HR212, HR121 or 5-Helix protein could serve as specific antiviral agents. These data provide additional insight into the difference between the virulent and avirulent strains of NDV.","It is hypothesized that the introduced exogenous HR1 or HR2 can compete against their endogenous counterparts, which results in fusion inhibition.","['It', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_introduced_exogenous_HR1', 'or', 'HR2', 'can', 'compete', 'against', 'their_endogenous_counterparts', ',', 'which', 'results', 'in', 'fusion_inhibition', '.']","It is hypothesized that the_introduced_exogenous_HR1 or HR2 can compete against their_endogenous_counterparts , which results in fusion_inhibition .","['the_introduced_exogenous_HR1', 'HR2', 'their_endogenous_counterparts', 'fusion_inhibition']"
"Many viruses have been implicated in utilizing or modulating the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) to enhance viral multiplication and/or to sustain a persistent infection. The mosquito-borne Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the Togaviridae family and is an important biodefense pathogen and select agent. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies for VEEV infections; therefore, it is imperative to identify novel targets for therapeutic development. We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication. We have shown that at non-toxic concentrations Bortezomib, a FDA-approved inhibitor of the proteasome, proved to be a potent inhibitor of VEEV multiplication in the human astrocytoma cell line U87MG. Bortezomib inhibited the virulent Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain and the attenuated TC-83 strain of VEEV. Additional studies with virulent strains of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) demonstrated that Bortezomib is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the New World alphaviruses. Time-of-addition assays showed that Bortezomib was an effective inhibitor of viral multiplication even when the drug was introduced many hours post exposure to the virus. Mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the VEEV capsid protein is ubiquitinated in infected cells, which was validated by confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assays. Subsequent studies revealed that capsid is ubiquitinated on K48 during early stages of infection which was affected by Bortezomib treatment. This study will aid future investigations in identifying host proteins as potential broad spectrum therapeutic targets for treating alphavirus infections.",We hypothesized that a functional UPS is required for efficient VEEV multiplication.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'a_functional_UPS', 'is', 'required', 'for', 'efficient_VEEV_multiplication', '.']",We hypothesized that a_functional_UPS is required for efficient_VEEV_multiplication .,"['a_functional_UPS', 'efficient_VEEV_multiplication']"
"Since the identification and imprisonment of “Typhoid Mary,” a woman who infected at least 47 people with typhoid in the early 1900s, epidemiologists have recognized that ‘superspreading’ hosts play a key role in disease epidemics. Such variability in transmission also exists among species within a community (amplification hosts) and among habitat patches across a landscape (disease ‘hotspots’), underscoring the need for an integrative framework for studying transmission heterogeneity. Here, we synthesize literature on human, plant, and animal diseases to evaluate the relative contributions of host, pathogen, and environmental factors in driving transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space. We show that host and spatial heterogeneity are closely linked and that quantitatively assessing the contribution of infectious individuals, species, or environmental patches to overall transmission can aid management strategies.

"The exact role of CD8(+) T cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has been heavily debated, yet it is generally accepted that CD8(+) T cells contribute to protection against Mtb. In this study, however, we show that the Mtb-susceptible CBA/J mouse strain accumulates large numbers of CD8(+) T cells in the lung as infection progresses, and that these cells display a dysfunctional and immunosuppressive phenotype (PD-1(+), Tim-3(+), CD122(+)). CD8(+) T cell expansions from the lungs of Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were also capable of secreting the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), although in vivo CD8(+) T cell depletion did not significantly alter Mtb burden. Further analysis revealed that pulmonary CD8(+) T cells from Mtb-infected CBA/J mice were clonally expanded, preferentially expressing T cell receptor (TcR) Vβ chain 8 (8.2, 8.3) or Vβ 14. Although Vβ8(+) CD8(+) T cells were responsible for the majority of IL-10 production, in vivo depletion of Vβ8(+) did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles. Our data demonstrate that IL-10-secreting CD8(+) T cells can arise during chronic Mtb infection, although the significance of this T cell population in tuberculosis pathogenesis remains unclear.","did not significantly change the outcome of Mtb infection, which we hypothesize was a consequence of their dual IL-10/IFN-γ secreting profiles.","['did', 'not', 'significantly', 'change', 'the_outcome', 'of', 'Mtb_infection', ',', 'which', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'was', 'a_consequence', 'of', 'their_dual_IL-10/IFN-γ_secreting_profiles', '.']","did not significantly change the_outcome of Mtb_infection , which we hypothesize was a_consequence of their_dual_IL-10/IFN-γ_secreting_profiles .","['the_outcome', 'Mtb_infection', 'a_consequence', 'their_dual_IL-10', 'IFN-γ_secreting_profiles']"
"The intraspecies genomic diversity of the single‐strand RNA (+) virus species hepatitis A virus (Hepatovirus), hepatitis C virus (Hepacivirus), and hepatitis E virus (Orthohepevirus) was compared. These viral species all can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), but share no gene similarity. The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood‐sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. We present evidence that these observations are only partly explained by differences in nucleotide composition of the complete viral codon regions. We consider the combination of nucleotide composition, amino acid composition, and codon usage preference suitable to provide information on possible evolutionary similarities between distant virus species that cannot be investigated by phylogeny.",An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals.,"['An_evolutionary_ancestor', 'of', 'HAV', 'and', 'related_virus_species', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'be', 'an_insect_virus', 'that', 'underwent', 'a_host_jump', 'to', 'infect', 'mammals', '.']",An_evolutionary_ancestor of HAV and related_virus_species is hypothesized to be an_insect_virus that underwent a_host_jump to infect mammals .,"['An_evolutionary_ancestor', 'HAV', 'related_virus_species', 'an_insect_virus', 'mammals']"

"To identify new host factors that modulate the replication of influenza A virus, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic tail of matrix protein 2 from the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. The screen revealed a high-score interaction with cyclin D3, a key regulator of cell cycle early G(1) phase. M2-cyclin D3 interaction was validated through GST pull-down and recapitulated in influenza A/WSN/33-infected cells. Knockdown of Ccnd3 by small interfering RNA significantly enhanced virus progeny titers in cell culture supernatants. Interestingly, the increase in virus production was due to cyclin D3 deficiency per se and not merely a consequence of cell cycle deregulation. A combined knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1, which rescued cell cycle progression into S phase, failed to normalize virus production. Infection by influenza A virus triggered redistribution of cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, followed by its proteasomal degradation. When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, cyclin D3 impaired binding of M2 with M1, which is essential for proper assembly of progeny virions, lending further support to its role as a putative restriction factor. Our study describes the identification and characterization of cyclin D3 as a novel interactor of influenza A virus M2 protein. We hypothesize that competitive inhibition of M1-M2 interaction by cyclin D3 impairs infectious virion formation and results in attenuated virus production.

"In order to test the hypothesis that RNA structural elements promote the distribution of certain types of recombination junctions in each one of the 2C and 3D poliovirus genomic regions (Sabin 3/Sabin 2 or Sabin 1 in 2C and Sabin 2/Sabin 1 or Sabin 3 in 3D), we searched in 2C and 3D regions of reference Sabin strains for high probability RNA structural elements that could promote recombination. Recombination junctions that were identified in clinical strains of this study, as well as in clinical strains of previous studies, were superimposed on RNA secondary structure models of 2C and 3D genomic regions. Furthermore, we created an in vitro model, based on double infection of cell-culture with two poliovirus strains, for the production and identification of recombinant Sabin strains in 2C and 3D regions. Our intention was to compare the results that refer to the correlation of recombination junctions and RNA secondary structures in 2C and 3D regions of clinical strains, with the respective results of the in vitro model. Most of the recombination junctions of the clinical strains were correlated with RNA secondary structure elements, which were identical between recombining Sabin strains, and also presented high predictive value. In consensus were, the respective results originated from the in vitro model. We propose that the distribution of specific types of recombination junctions in certain regions of Sabin strains is not fortuitous and is correlated with RNA secondary structure elements identical to both recombination partners.

"Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) is a parvovirus associated with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children, but a causal relation has not yet been confirmed.

A real-time reverse transcription PCR, targeting 2 alternatively spliced mRNAs, was developed. HBoV1 mRNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 33 (25%) of 133 children with RTIs but in none of 28 controls (p<0.001). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the test were good.

"Cellular immune mechanisms that regulate viral gene expression within infected brain cells remain poorly understood. Previous work has shown that systemic immunization against adenovirus after vector delivery to the brain results in complete loss of brain cells infected by adenoviral vectors. Although T cells play an important role in this process, we demonstrate herein that B cells also significantly regulate transgene expression from the CNS. After the systemic immunization against adenovirus of animals injected via the brain with an adenoviral vector 30 days earlier, we uncovered substantial infiltration by CD19(+) B cells of the area of the brain transduced by the virus. This suggests the involvement of B cells in the adaptive immune response-mediated loss of transduced cells from the brain. Confocal analysis of these brains demonstrated physical contacts between transduced brain cells and CD19(+) cells. To test the hypothesis that B cells play a causal role in the loss of infected cells from the brain, we demonstrated that animals devoid of B cells were unable to eliminate transgene expression at early time points after immunization. This demonstrates that B cells play a necessary role in the loss of transgene expression at early, but not late, time points postimmunization. Thus, these data have important implications for our understanding of the role of B cells as immune effectors during the immune-mediated clearance of viral infections from the CNS, and also for understanding mechanisms operating in brain autoimmunity, as well as for the potential safety of clinical gene therapy for brain diseases.","To test the hypothesis that B cells play a causal role in the loss of infected cells from the brain, we demonstrated that animals devoid of B cells were unable to eliminate transgene expression at early time points after immunization.","['To', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'B_cells', 'play', 'a_causal_role', 'in', 'the_loss', 'of', 'infected_cells', 'from', 'the_brain', ',', 'we', 'demonstrated', 'that', 'animals', 'devoid', 'of', 'B_cells', 'were', 'unable', 'to', 'eliminate', 'transgene_expression', 'at', 'early_time_points', 'after', 'immunization', '.']","To test the_hypothesis that B_cells play a_causal_role in the_loss of infected_cells from the_brain , we demonstrated that animals devoid of B_cells were unable to eliminate transgene_expression at early_time_points after immunization .","['the_hypothesis', 'B_cells', 'a_causal_role', 'the_loss', 'infected_cells', 'the_brain', 'animals', 'B_cells', 'transgene_expression', 'early_time_points', 'immunization']"
"BACKGROUND: Multiple infections are common in natural host populations and interspecific parasite interactions are therefore likely within a host individual. As they may seriously impact the circulation of certain parasites and the emergence and management of infectious diseases, their study is essential. In the field, detecting parasite interactions is rendered difficult by the fact that a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. To correct for these “false interactions”, methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present paper we propose such a method for presence-absence data (i.e., serology). Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic. The method is termed “the corrected chi-square.” Its robustness was compared to a pre-existing method based on logistic regression and the corrected chi-square proved to be much more robust for small sample sizes. Since the logistic regression approach is easier to implement, we propose as a rule of thumb to use the latter when the ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters is above ten. Applied to serological data for four viruses infecting cats, the approach revealed pairwise interactions between the Feline Herpesvirus, Parvovirus and Calicivirus, whereas the infection by FIV, the feline equivalent of HIV, did not modify the risk of infection by any of these viruses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This work therefore points out possible interactions that can be further investigated in experimental conditions and, by providing a user-friendly R program and a tutorial example, offers new opportunities for animal and human epidemiologists to detect interactions of interest in the field, a crucial step in the challenge of multiple infections.","Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic.","['Our_method', 'enables', 'the_calculation', 'of', 'the_expected_frequencies', 'of', 'single_and_double_infected_individuals', 'under', 'the_independence_hypothesis', ',', 'before', 'comparing', 'them', 'to', 'the_observed_ones', 'using', 'the_chi-square_statistic', '.']","Our_method enables the_calculation of the_expected_frequencies of single_and_double_infected_individuals under the_independence_hypothesis , before comparing them to the_observed_ones using the_chi-square_statistic .","['Our_method', 'the_calculation', 'the_expected_frequencies', 'single_and_double_infected_individuals', 'the_independence_hypothesis', 'the_observed_ones']"

The function of GSDMA in the skin was deduced by dominant mutations in mouse gasdermin A3 (Gsdma3), which caused skin inflammation and hair loss. However, the mechanism for the autosomal dominance of Gsdma3 mutations and the mode of Gsdma3’s action remain unanswered. RESULTS: We demonstrated a novel function of Gsdma3 in modulating mitochondrial oxidative stress. We showed that Gsdma3 is regulated by intramolecular fold-back inhibition, which is disrupted by dominant mutations in the C-terminal domain. The unmasked N-terminal domain of Gsdma3 associates with Hsp90 and is delivered to mitochondrial via mitochondrial importer receptor Tom70, where it interacts with the mitochondrial chaperone Trap1 and causes increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 as well as pharmacological interventions of mitochondrial translocation, ROS production, and MPT pore opening alleviate the cell death induced by Gsdma3 mutants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the genetic mutations in the C-terminal domain of Gsdma3 are gain-of-function mutations which unmask the N-terminal functional domain of Gsdma3. Gsdma3 regulates mitochondrial oxidative stress through mitochondrial targeting. Since mitochondrial ROS has been shown to promote epidermal differentiation, we hypothesize that Gsdma3 regulates context-dependent response of keratinocytes to differentiation and cell death signals by impinging on mitochondria.

"BACKGROUND: Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an exogenous gammaretrovirus of domestic cats (Felis catus) and some wild felids. The outcomes of FeLV infection in domestic cats vary according to host susceptibility, virus strain, and infectious challenge dose. Jaguarundis (Puma yagouaroundi) are small wild felids from South and Central America. We previously reported on FeLV infections in jaguarundis. We hypothesized here that the outcomes of FeLV infection in P. yagouaroundi mimic those observed in domestic cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the population of jaguarundis at Fundação Parque Zoológico de São Paulo for natural FeLV infection and resulting outcomes. METHODS: We investigated the jaguarundis using serological and molecular methods and monitored them for FeLV-related diseases for 5 years. We retrieved relevant biological and clinical information for the entire population of 23 jaguarundis held at zoo. Post-mortem findings from necropsies were recorded and histopathological and immunohistopathological analyses were performed. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed for FeLV-positive samples. For sample prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare frequencies between infected and uninfected animals. P-values <0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: In total, we detected evidence of FeLV exposure in four out of 23 animals (17%; 95% CI 5–39%). No endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) sequences were detected. An intestinal B-cell lymphoma in one jaguarundi was not associated with FeLV. Two jaguarundis presented FeLV test results consistent with an abortive FeLV infection with seroconversion, and two other jaguarundis had results consistent with a progressive infection and potentially FeLV-associated clinical disorders and post-mortem changes. Phylogenetic analysis of env revealed the presence of FeLV-A, a common origin of the virus in both animals (100% identity) and the closest similarity to FeLV-FAIDS and FeLV-3281 (98.4% identity), originally isolated from cats in the USA.

"Consisting of nearly 60 functional genes, porcine interferon (IFN)-complex represents an evolutionary surge of IFN evolution in domestic ungulate species. To compare with humans and mice, each of these species contains about 20 IFN functional genes, which are better characterized using the conventional IFN-α/β subtypes as examples. Porcine IFN-complex thus represents an optimal model for studying IFN evolution that resulted from increasing viral pressure during domestication and industrialization. We hypothesize and justify that porcine IFN-complex may extend its functionality in antiviral and immunomodulatory activity due to its superior molecular diversity. Furthermore, these unconventional IFNs could even confer some functional and signaling novelty beyond that of the well-studied IFN-α/β subtypes. Investigations into porcine IFN-complex will further our understanding of IFN biology and promote IFN-based therapeutic designs to confront swine viral diseases.",We hypothesize and justify that porcine IFN-complex may extend its functionality in antiviral and immunomodulatory activity due to its superior molecular diversity.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'and', 'justify', 'that', 'porcine', 'IFN', '-', 'complex', 'may', 'extend', 'its_functionality', 'in', 'antiviral_and_immunomodulatory_activity', 'due', 'to', 'its_superior_molecular_diversity', '.']",We hypothesize and justify that porcine IFN - complex may extend its_functionality in antiviral_and_immunomodulatory_activity due to its_superior_molecular_diversity .,"['porcine', 'IFN', 'its_functionality', 'antiviral_and_immunomodulatory_activity', 'its_superior_molecular_diversity']"
"The chicken upper respiratory tract is the portal of entry for respiratory pathogens, such as avian influenza virus (AIV). The presence of microorganisms is sensed by pathogen recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs)) of the innate immune defenses. Innate responses are essential for subsequent induction of potent adaptive immune responses, but little information is available about innate antiviral responses of the chicken trachea. We hypothesized that TLR ligands induce innate antiviral responses in the chicken trachea. Tracheal organ cultures (TOC) were used to investigate localized innate responses to TLR ligands. Expression of candidate genes, which play a role in antiviral responses, was quantified. To confirm the antiviral responses of stimulated TOC, chicken macrophages were treated with supernatants from stimulated TOC, prior to infection with AIV. The results demonstrated that TLR ligands induced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons and interferon stimulated genes in the chicken trachea. In conclusion, TLR ligands induce functional antiviral responses in the chicken trachea, which may act against some pathogens, such as AIV.",We hypothesized that TLR ligands induce innate antiviral responses in the chicken trachea.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'TLR_ligands', 'induce', 'innate', 'antiviral_responses', 'in', 'the_chicken_trachea', '.']",We hypothesized that TLR_ligands induce innate antiviral_responses in the_chicken_trachea .,"['TLR_ligands', 'antiviral_responses', 'the_chicken_trachea']"
"Cancer is one of the leading health concerns for human and animal health. Since the tumorigenesis process is not completely understood and it is known that some viruses can induce carcinogenesis, it is highly important to identify novel oncoviruses and extensively study underlying oncogenic mechanisms. Here, we investigated a case of diffuse histiocytic sarcoma in a 22 year old slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), using a broad spectrum virus discovery technique. A novel parvovirus was discovered and the phylogenetic analysis performed on its fully sequenced genome demonstrated that it represents the first member of a novel genus. The possible causative correlation between this virus and the malignancy was further investigated and 20 serum and 61 organ samples from 25 animals (N. coucang and N. pygmaeus) were screened for the novel virus but only samples collected from the originally infected animal were positive. The virus was present in all tested organs (intestine, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs) and in all banked serum samples collected up to 8 years before death. All attempts to identify a latent viral form (integrated or episomal) were unsuccessful and the increase of variation in the viral sequences during the years was consistent with absence of latency. Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma. It is also possible to conjecture that the virus had a role in delaying the tumor progression and this report might bring new exciting opportunities in recognizing viruses to be used in cancer virotherapy.","Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell division to successfully replicate, we hypothesized that the virus could have benefitted from the constantly dividing cancer cells and may not have been the cause of the histiocytic sarcoma.","['Since', 'it', 'is', 'well', 'known', 'that', 'parvoviruses', 'are', 'dependent', 'on', 'cell_division', 'to', 'successfully', 'replicate', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_virus', 'could', 'have', 'benefitted', 'from', 'the_constantly_dividing_cancer_cells', 'and', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'the_cause', 'of', 'the_histiocytic_sarcoma', '.']","Since it is well known that parvoviruses are dependent on cell_division to successfully replicate , we hypothesized that the_virus could have benefitted from the_constantly_dividing_cancer_cells and may not have been the_cause of the_histiocytic_sarcoma .","['parvoviruses', 'cell_division', 'the_virus', 'the_constantly_dividing_cancer_cells', 'the_cause', 'the_histiocytic_sarcoma']"
"During pregnancy, the maternal immune response changes dramatically over the course of gestation. This has implications for generation of lactogenic immunity and subsequent protection in suckling neonates against enteric viral infections. For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that causes acute diarrhea in neonatal piglets. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the naïve, immature immune system of neonatal suckling piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced during pregnancy, via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, is critical for piglet protection. However, the anti-PEDV immune response during pregnancy and stage of gestation required to optimally stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis is undefined. We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets. To understand how the stages of gestation affect maternal immune responses to PEDV, three groups of gilts were orally infected with PEDV in the first, second or third trimester. Control (mock) gilts were inoculated with medium in the third trimester. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3–5 days postpartum. PEDV infection of gilts at different stages of gestation significantly affected multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including cytokines, B cells, PEDV antibodies (Abs), and PEDV antibody secreting cells (ASCs). Pregnant second trimester gilts had significantly higher levels of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs and ASCs and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs post PEDV infection. Coinciding with the significantly higher PEDV Ab responses in second trimester gilts, the survival rate of their PEDV-challenged piglets was 100%, compared with 87.2, 55.9, and 5.7% for first, third, and mock litters, respectively. Additionally, piglet survival positively correlated with PEDV IgA Abs and ASCs and VN Abs in milk and PEDV IgA and IgG Abs in piglet serum. Our findings have implications for gestational timing of oral attenuated PEDV maternal vaccines, whereby PEDV intestinal infection in the second trimester optimally stimulated the gut-MG-sIgA axis resulting in 100% lactogenic immune protection in suckling piglets.","We hypothesize that there is a gestational window in which non-lethal PEDV infection of pregnant gilts influences maximum lymphocyte mucosal trafficking to the MG, resulting in optimal passive lactogenic protection in suckling piglets.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'there', 'is', 'a_gestational_window', 'in', 'which', 'non-lethal_PEDV_infection', 'of', 'pregnant_gilts', 'influences', 'maximum_lymphocyte_mucosal', 'trafficking', 'to', 'the_MG', ',', 'resulting', 'in', 'optimal_passive_lactogenic_protection', 'in', 'suckling', 'piglets', '.']","We hypothesize that there is a_gestational_window in which non-lethal_PEDV_infection of pregnant_gilts influences maximum_lymphocyte_mucosal trafficking to the_MG , resulting in optimal_passive_lactogenic_protection in suckling piglets .","['a_gestational_window', 'which non-lethal_PEDV_infection', 'pregnant_gilts', 'influences', 'optimal_passive_lactogenic_protection', 'piglets']"
"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and other neurotropic virus infections result in degeneration of each component of the neuron: apoptosis of the cell body, axonal (Wallerian) degeneration, and dendritic and synaptic pathology. In general, axonal degeneration is detrimental for hosts. However, axonal degeneration can be beneficial in the case of infection with neurotropic viruses that spread in the CNS using axonal transport. C57BL/Wld(S) (Wld(S), Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) mice are protected from axonal degeneration. Wld(S) mice infected with the neurovirulent GDVII strain of TMEV are more resistant to virus infection than wild-type mice, suggesting that axonal preservation contributes to the resistance. By contrast, infection with the less virulent Daniels strain of TMEV results in high levels of virus propagation in the CNS, suggesting that prolonged survival of axons in Wld(S) mice favors virus spread. Thus, axonal degeneration might be a beneficial self-destruct mechanism that limits the spread of neurotropic viruses, in the case of less virulent virus infection. We hypothesize that neurons use ‘built-in’ self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site. Early induction of apoptosis in the neuronal cell body limits virus replication. Wallerian degeneration of the axon prevents axonal transport of virus. Dendritic and synaptic degeneration blocks virus transmission at synapses. Thus, the balance between neurodegeneration and virus propagation may be taken into account in the future design of neuroprotective therapy.","We hypothesize that neurons use ‘built-in’ self-destruct protection machinery (compartmental neurodegeneration) against neurotropic virus infection, since the CNS is an immunologically privileged site.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'neurons', 'use', '‘', 'built', '-', 'in', '’', 'self-destruct_protection_machinery', '(', 'compartmental', 'neurodegeneration', ')', 'against', 'neurotropic_virus_infection', ',', 'since', 'the_CNS', 'is', 'an_immunologically_privileged_site', '.']","We hypothesize that neurons use ‘ built - in ’ self-destruct_protection_machinery ( compartmental neurodegeneration ) against neurotropic_virus_infection , since the_CNS is an_immunologically_privileged_site .","['neurons', 'self-destruct_protection_machinery', 'neurodegeneration', 'the_CNS']"
"BACKGROUND: Globally, regions at the highest risk for emerging infectious diseases are often the ones with the fewest resources. As a result, implementing sustainable infectious disease surveillance systems in these regions is challenging. The cost of these programs and difficulties associated with collecting, storing and transporting relevant samples have hindered them in the regions where they are most needed. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity and feasibility of a novel surveillance technique called xenosurveillance. This approach utilizes the host feeding preferences and behaviors of Anopheles gambiae, which are highly anthropophilic and rest indoors after feeding, to sample viruses in human beings. We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To validate this approach, we examined variables influencing virus detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host’s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion using our laboratory model. Our findings revealed that viral nucleic acids, at clinically relevant concentrations, could be detected from engorged mosquitoes for up to 24 hours post feeding by qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we tested this approach in the field by examining blood from engorged mosquitoes from two field sites in Liberia. Using next-generation sequencing and PCR we were able to detect the genetic signatures of multiple viral pathogens including Epstein-Barr virus and canine distemper virus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of xenosurveillance and in doing so validated a simple and non-invasive surveillance tool that could be used to complement current biosurveillance efforts.",We hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'mosquito_bloodmeals', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'to', 'detect', 'vertebrate_viral_pathogens', 'within', 'realistic_field_collection_timeframes', 'and', 'clinically_relevant_concentrations', '.']",We hypothesized that mosquito_bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate_viral_pathogens within realistic_field_collection_timeframes and clinically_relevant_concentrations .,"['mosquito_bloodmeals', 'vertebrate_viral_pathogens', 'realistic_field_collection_timeframes', 'clinically_relevant_concentrations']"
"IMPORTANCE: Historically, otolaryngologists have focused on nasal resistance to airflow and minimum airspace cross-sectional area as objective measures of nasal obstruction using methods such as rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry. However, subjective sensation of nasal patency may be more associated with activation of cold receptors by inspired air than with respiratory effort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether subjective nasal patency correlates with nasal mucosal temperature in healthy subjects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two healthy adults were recruited for this study. Subjects first completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and a unilateral visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify subjective nasal patency. A miniaturized thermocouple sensor was then used to record nasal mucosal temperature bilaterally in two locations along the nasal septum: at the vestibule and across from the inferior turbinate head. RESULTS: The range of temperature oscillations during the breathing cycle, defined as the difference between end-expiratory and end-inspiratory temperatures, was greater during deep breaths (ΔT(exp-insp) = 6.2 ± 2.6°C) than during resting breathing (ΔT(exp-insp) = 4.2 ± 2.3°C) in both locations (p < 10(−13)). Mucosal temperature measured at the right vestibule had a statistically significant correlation with both right-side VAS score (Pearson r = −0.55, p=0.0076) and NOSE score (Pearson r = −0.47, p=0.028). No other statistically significant correlations were found between mucosal temperature and subjective nasal patency scores. Nasal mucosal temperature was lower in the first cavity to be measured, which was the right cavity in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation. A possible correlation was found between subjective nasal patency scores and nasal mucosal temperature, but our results were inconsistent. The higher temperature in the left cavity suggests that the sensor irritated the nasal mucosa, affecting the correlation between patency scores and mucosal temperature. Future studies should consider non-contact temperature sensors to prevent mucosa irritation.","The greater mucosal temperature oscillations during deep breathing is consistent with the common experience that airflow sensation is enhanced during deep breaths, thus supporting the hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a central role in nasal airflow sensation.","['The_greater_mucosal_temperature_oscillations', 'during', 'deep_breathing', 'is', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_common_experience', 'that', 'airflow_sensation', 'is', 'enhanced', 'during', 'deep_breaths', ',', 'thus', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'mucosal', 'cooling', 'plays', 'a_central_role', 'in', 'nasal_airflow_sensation', '.']","The_greater_mucosal_temperature_oscillations during deep_breathing is consistent with the_common_experience that airflow_sensation is enhanced during deep_breaths , thus supporting the_hypothesis that mucosal cooling plays a_central_role in nasal_airflow_sensation .","['the_common_experience', 'airflow_sensation', 'deep_breaths', 'the_hypothesis', 'mucosal cooling', 'a_central_role']"
"Viruses must parasitize host cell translational machinery in order to make proteins for viral progeny. In this study, we sought to use this signal transduction conduit against them by inhibiting multiple kinases that influence translation. Previous work indicated that several kinases involved in translation, including p70 S6K, p90RSK, ERK, and p38 MAPK, are phosphorylated following Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. Furthermore, inhibiting p70 S6K through treatment with the FDA approved drug rapamycin prevents RVFV pathogenesis in a mouse model of infection. We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSK’s upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication. Treatment with the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of translational proteins and reduced RVFV titers. In contrast, treatment with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 alone had minimal influence on RVFV titers. The combination of PF-4708671 and BI-D1870 treatment resulted in robust inhibition of RVFV replication. Likewise, a synergistic inhibition of RVFV replication was observed with p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD0325901 combined with rapamycin treatment. These findings serve as a proof of concept regarding combination kinase inhibitor treatment for RVFV infection.","We hypothesized that inhibiting either p70 S6K, p90RSK, or p90RSK’s upstream kinases, ERK and p38 MAPK, would decrease translation and subsequent viral replication.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'inhibiting', 'either_p70_S6K', ',', 'p90RSK', ',', 'or', 'p90RSK', '’s', 'upstream_kinases', ',', 'ERK', 'and', 'p38_MAPK', ',', 'would', 'decrease', 'translation', 'and', 'subsequent_viral_replication', '.']","We hypothesized that inhibiting either_p70_S6K , p90RSK , or p90RSK ’s upstream_kinases , ERK and p38_MAPK , would decrease translation and subsequent_viral_replication .","['either_p70_S6K', 'p90RSK', 'p90RSK', 'upstream_kinases', 'ERK', 'p38_MAPK', 'translation', 'subsequent_viral_replication']"

"Evidence for the tenuous regulation between the immune system and central nervous system (CNS) can be found with examples of interaction between these organ systems gone awry. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the prototypical inflammatory disease of the CNS and is characterized by widely distributed inflammatory demyelinating plaques that can involve the brain, spinal cord and/or optic nerves. Optic neuritis (ON), inflammatory injury of the optic nerve that frequently occurs in patients with MS, has been the focus of intense study in part given the readily accessible nature of clinical outcome measures. Exploring the clinical and pathological features of ON in relation to other inflammatory demyelinating conditions of the CNS, namely MS and neuromyelitis optica, provides an opportunity to glean common and distinct mechanisms of disease. Emerging data from clinical studies along with various animal models involving ON implicate innate and adaptive immune responses directed at glial targets, including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and aquaporin 4. Resolution of inflammation in ON is commonly observed both clinically and experimentally, but persistent nerve injury is also one emerging hallmark of ON. One hypothesis seeking evaluation is that, in comparison to other sites targeted in MS, the optic nerve is a highly specialized target within the CNS predisposing to unique immunologic processes that generate ON. Overall, ON serves as a highly relevant entity for understanding the pathogenesis of other CNS demyelinating conditions, most notably MS.","One hypothesis seeking evaluation is that, in comparison to other sites targeted in MS, the optic nerve is a highly specialized target within the CNS predisposing to unique immunologic processes that generate ON.","['One_hypothesis', 'seeking', 'evaluation', 'is', 'that', ',', 'in', 'comparison', 'to', 'other_sites', 'targeted', 'in', 'MS', ',', 'the_optic_nerve', 'is', 'a_highly_specialized_target', 'within', 'the_CNS', 'predisposing', 'to', 'unique_immunologic_processes', 'that', 'generate', 'ON', '.']","One_hypothesis seeking evaluation is that , in comparison to other_sites targeted in MS , the_optic_nerve is a_highly_specialized_target within the_CNS predisposing to unique_immunologic_processes that generate ON .","['One_hypothesis', 'evaluation', 'comparison', 'other_sites', 'MS', 'the_optic_nerve', 'a_highly_specialized_target', 'unique_immunologic_processes', 'ON']"
"Abstract Bats (Chiroptera) are the only mammals naturally able to fly. Due to this characteristic they play a relevant ecological role in the niches they inhabit. These mammals spread infectious diseases from enzootic to domestic foci. Rabbies, SARS, fungi, ebola and trypanosomes are the most common pathogens these animals may host. We conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae, vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from Casanare department in eastern Colombia. Blood-EDTA samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species.

"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes immune dysregulation during the Critical Window of Immunological Development. We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces “holes” in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens. The deficiency may be the result of random elimination of PRRSV-specific T cells or the generation of T cells that accept PRRSV epitopes as self-antigens. Loss of helper T cells for virus neutralizing (VN) epitopes can result in the failure of selection for B cells in lymph node germinal centers capable of producing high affinity VN antibodies. Generation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells may also be impaired. Similar to infections with LDV, LCMV, MCMV, HIV-1 and trypanosomes, the host responds to the deficiency of pathogen-specific T cells and perhaps regulatory T cells, by “last ditch” polyclonal B cell activation. In colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets, this results in hypergammaglobulinemia, which we believe to be a “red herring” that detracts attention from the thymic atrophy story, but leads to our second independent hypothesis. Since hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets, we hypothesize that this is due to the down-regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG and cytokines in porcine colostrum, especially TGFβ which stimulates development of regulatory T cells (Tregs).",We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces “holes” in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'thymocyte_development', 'is', 'altered', 'by', 'infected_thymic_antigen_presenting_cells', '(', 'TAPCs', ')', 'in', 'the_fetal/neonatal_thymus', 'that', 'interact', 'with', 'double-positive_thymocytes', 'causing', 'an_acute_deficiency', 'of', 'T_cells', 'that', 'produces', '“holes', '”', 'in', 'the_T_cell_repertoire', 'allowing', 'for', 'poor_recognition', 'of', 'PRRSV', 'and', 'other_neonatal_pathogens', '.']",We hypothesize that thymocyte_development is altered by infected_thymic_antigen_presenting_cells ( TAPCs ) in the_fetal/neonatal_thymus that interact with double-positive_thymocytes causing an_acute_deficiency of T_cells that produces “holes ” in the_T_cell_repertoire allowing for poor_recognition of PRRSV and other_neonatal_pathogens .,"['thymocyte_development', 'infected_thymic_antigen_presenting_cells ( TAPCs', 'the_fetal/neonatal_thymus', 'double-positive_thymocytes', 'an_acute_deficiency', 'T_cells', '“holes', 'the_T_cell_repertoire', 'poor_recognition', 'PRRSV', 'other_neonatal_pathogens']"
"Viruses assemble large macromolecular repeat structures that become part of the infectious particles or virions. Ribonucleocapsids (RNCs) of negative strand RNA viruses are a prime example where repetition of nucleoprotein (NP) along the genome creates a core polymeric helical scaffold that accommodates other nucleocapsid proteins including viral polymerase. The RNCs are transported through the cytosol for packaging into virions through association with viral matrix proteins at cell membranes. We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging. Previously, we had generated single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) against Filoviruses that have all targeted highly conserved C-terminal regions of NP known to be repetitively exposed along the length of the RNCs of Marburgvirus (MARV) and Ebolavirus (EBOV). Our crosslinker design consisted of dimeric sdAb expressed intracellularly, which we call Xintrabodies (X- for crosslinking). Electron microscopy of purified NP polymers incubated with purified sdAb constructs showed NP aggregation occurred in a genus-specific manner with dimeric and not monomeric sdAb. A virus-like particle (VLP) assay was used for initial evaluation where we found that dimeric sdAb inhibited NP incorporation into VP40-based VLPs whereas monomeric sdAb did not. Inhibition of NP packaging was genus specific. Confocal microscopy revealed dimeric sdAb was diffuse when expressed alone but focused on pools of NP when the two were coexpressed, while monomeric sdAb showed ambivalent partition. Infection of stable Vero cell lines expressing dimeric sdAb specific for either MARV or EBOV NP resulted in smaller plaques and reduced progeny of cognate virus relative to wild-type Vero cells. Though the impact was marginal at later time-points, the collective data suggest that viral replication can be reduced by crosslinking intracellular NP using relatively small amounts of dimeric sdAb to restrict NP packaging. The stoichiometry and ease of application of the approach would likely benefit from transitioning away from intracellular expression of crosslinking sdAb to exogenous delivery of antibody. By retuning sdAb specificity, the approach of crosslinking highly conserved regions of assembly critical proteins may well be applicable to inhibiting replication processes of a broad spectrum of viruses.","We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant protein–protein interactions, thereby blocking their orderly transport and packaging.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'RNC', 'would', 'be', 'ideal_targets', 'for', 'crosslinkers', 'engineered', 'to', 'promote', 'aberrant_protein', '–', 'protein_interactions', ',', 'thereby', 'blocking', 'their_orderly_transport', 'and', 'packaging', '.']","We hypothesized that RNC would be ideal_targets for crosslinkers engineered to promote aberrant_protein – protein_interactions , thereby blocking their_orderly_transport and packaging .","['RNC', 'ideal_targets', 'crosslinkers', 'aberrant_protein', 'protein_interactions', 'their_orderly_transport', 'packaging']"
"The aim of this manuscript is to describe how modern advances in our knowledge of viruses and viral evolution can be applied to the fields of disease ecology and conservation. We review recent progress in virology and provide examples of how it is informing both empirical research in field ecology and applied conservation. We include a discussion of needed breakthroughs and ways to bridge communication gaps between the field and the lab. In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today’s globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues.",The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and/or intervention strategies.,"['The_importance', 'of', 'understanding', 'the_dynamics', 'of', 'zoonotic_pathogens', 'in', 'their_reservoir_hosts', 'is', 'emphasized', 'as', 'a_tool', 'to', 'both', 'assess', 'risk_factors', 'for', 'spillover', 'and', 'to', 'test', 'hypotheses', 'related', 'to', 'treatment_and/or_intervention_strategies', '.']",The_importance of understanding the_dynamics of zoonotic_pathogens in their_reservoir_hosts is emphasized as a_tool to both assess risk_factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment_and/or_intervention_strategies .,"['The_importance', 'understanding', 'the_dynamics', 'zoonotic_pathogens', 'their_reservoir_hosts', 'a_tool', 'assess', 'risk_factors', 'spillover', 'hypotheses', 'treatment_and/or_intervention_strategies']"
"The hypogravity motor syndrome (HMS) is one of the deleterious impacts of weightlessness on the human body in orbital space missions. There is a hypothesis that disorders of musculoskeletal system as part of HMS arise in consequence of changes in spinal motor neurons. The study was aimed at bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome changes in lumbar spinal cords of mice after a 30-day spaceflight aboard biosatellite Bion-M1 (space group, S) and subsequent 7-day readaptation to the Earth’s gravity (recovery group, R) when compared with control mice (C group) housed in simulated biosatellite conditions on the Earth. Gene ontology and human phenotype ontology databases were used to detect biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, and human phenotypes associated with HMS. Our results suggest resemblance of molecular changes developing in space orbit and during the postflight recovery to terrestrial neuromuscular disorders. Remarkably, more prominent transcriptome changes were revealed in R vs. S and R vs. C comparisons that are possibly related to the 7-day recovery period in the Earth’s gravity condition. These data may assist with establishment of HMS pathogenesis and proposing effective preventive and therapeutic options.",There is a hypothesis that disorders of musculoskeletal system as part of HMS arise in consequence of changes in spinal motor neurons.,"['There', 'is', 'a_hypothesis', 'that', 'disorders', 'of', 'musculoskeletal_system', 'as', 'part', 'of', 'HMS', 'arise', 'in', 'consequence', 'of', 'changes', 'in', 'spinal_motor_neurons', '.']",There is a_hypothesis that disorders of musculoskeletal_system as part of HMS arise in consequence of changes in spinal_motor_neurons .,"['a_hypothesis', 'disorders', 'musculoskeletal_system', 'part', 'HMS', 'consequence', 'changes', 'spinal_motor_neurons']"
"Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We hypothesized distinct molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system, inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the 46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema.

"DNA sequences seen in the normal character-based representation appear to have a formidable mixing of the four nucleotides without any apparent order. Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.","From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences.","['From', 'this_hitherto_undescribed_relationship', 'for', 'the_gene_sequences', 'considered', 'in', 'this_report', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'such_relationships', 'may', 'be', 'characteristic', 'of', 'these_sequences', 'and', 'therefore', 'could', 'become', 'a_barrier', 'to', 'large_scale_sequence_alterations', 'that', 'override', 'such_characteristics', ',', 'perhaps', 'through', 'some_monitoring_process', 'inbuilt', 'in', 'the_DNA_sequences', '.']","From this_hitherto_undescribed_relationship for the_gene_sequences considered in this_report we hypothesize that such_relationships may be characteristic of these_sequences and therefore could become a_barrier to large_scale_sequence_alterations that override such_characteristics , perhaps through some_monitoring_process inbuilt in the_DNA_sequences .","['this_hitherto_undescribed_relationship', 'the_gene_sequences', 'this_report', 'such_relationships', 'these_sequences', 'a_barrier', 'large_scale_sequence_alterations', 'override', 'such_characteristics', 'inbuilt', 'the_DNA_sequences']"
"BACKGROUND: Respiratory pathology is a major driver of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), even in the absence of a primary respiratory diagnosis. Prior work has demonstrated that a visual scoring system applied to chest radiographs (CXR) is associated with adverse outcomes in ICU patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis. METHODS: All individuals enrolled in the Registry of Critical Illness at Brigham and Women’s Hospital between June 2008 and August 2018 who had a CXR within 24 h of admission were included. Each patient’s CXR was assigned an opacification score of 0–4 in each of four quadrants with the total score being the sum of all four quadrants. Multivariable negative binomial, logistic, and Cox regression, adjusted for age, sex, race, immunosuppression, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of congestive heart failure, and APACHE II scores, were used to assess the total score’s association with ICU length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, and overall mortality, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 560 patients were included. Higher CXR scores were associated with increased mortality; for every one-point increase in score, in-hospital mortality increased 10% (OR 1.10, CI 1.05–1.16, p < 0.001) and 60-day mortality increased by 12% (OR 1.12, CI 1.07–1.17, p < 0.001). CXR scores were also independently associated with both ICU length of stay (rate ratio 1.06, CI 1.04–1.07, p < 0.001) and duration of mechanical ventilation (rate ratio 1.05, CI 1.02–1.07, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher values on a simple visual score of a patient’s CXR on admission to the medical ICU are associated with increased in-hospital mortality, 60-day mortality, overall mortality, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.","We hypothesized that a simple, semi-quantitative CXR score would be associated with clinical outcomes for the general ICU population, regardless of underlying diagnosis.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'a_simple,_semi-quantitative_CXR_score', 'would', 'be', 'associated', 'with', 'clinical_outcomes', 'for', 'the_general_ICU_population', ',', 'regardless', 'of', 'underlying_diagnosis', '.']","We hypothesized that a_simple,_semi-quantitative_CXR_score would be associated with clinical_outcomes for the_general_ICU_population , regardless of underlying_diagnosis .","['a_simple,_semi-quantitative_CXR_score', 'clinical_outcomes', 'the_general_ICU_population', 'underlying_diagnosis']"
"Abstract Epimedium flavonoids inhibit extravascular lipid deposition during prevention of steroid-associated osteonecrosis. Desmethylicaritin is a bioactive metabolite of Epimedium flavonoids in serum. As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition. This study was designed to investigate the effect of desmethylicaritin on adipogenesis and its underlying mechanism in vitro. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Bromodeoxyuridine was used to test the clonal expansion. Further, the mRNA level and protein expression of adipgenic and related factors were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. The nuclear location of β-catenin was identified using immunofluoresence assay. Our results showed that desmethylicaritin suppressed the adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, desmethylicaritin inhibited clonal expansion during adipogenesis. Desmethylicaritin did not affect CCAAT/enhancer binding protein δ and β mRNA expression, but decreased the mRNA expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, adipocyte lipid-binding protein and lipoprotein lipase. Desmethylicaritin up-regulated the mRNA expression of Wnt10b that was however down-regulated after adipogenic induction. Desmethylicaritin increased the protein expression of β-catenin both in the cytoplasm and nuclei and immunofluorescence results confirmed that desmethylicaritin increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Above findings implied that desmethylicaritin was able to inhibit adipogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was regulated by desmethylicaritin in the process of suppression of adipogenesis. Above findings supported desmethylicaritin as a novel phytochemical agent for potential prevention of disorders involving lipid metabolism.","As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis, so we hypothesized that desmethylicaritin as a phytoestrogen might have the potential to inhibit lipid deposition.","['As', 'it', 'is', 'well', 'known', 'that', 'estrogen', 'inhibits', 'aidpogenesis', ',', 'so', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that_desmethylicaritin', 'as', 'a_phytoestrogen', 'might', 'have', 'the_potential', 'to', 'inhibit', 'lipid_deposition', '.']","As it is well known that estrogen inhibits aidpogenesis , so we hypothesized that_desmethylicaritin as a_phytoestrogen might have the_potential to inhibit lipid_deposition .","['estrogen', 'inhibits', 'aidpogenesis', 'that_desmethylicaritin', 'a_phytoestrogen', 'the_potential', 'lipid_deposition']"
"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) affects the lower respiratory tract of cattle, causing high mortality. The syndrome has a multifactorial etiology and transport seems to favor pathogen proliferation. This study investigated the prevalence of different pathogens involved in BRD, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers collected before and after a long-distance journey. A total of 56 Limousine animals were included, travelling in three different shipments, on the same route from France to southern Italy in a semitrailer, on three different days from February to April. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNS)/steer were collected and tested by bimolecular analysis. Neither bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) nor bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) were detected. A higher prevalence of Histophilus somni was observed in the DNS collected during the third shipment in comparison with those registered during the first and the second one, probably due to a higher prevalence at departure. Conversely, the prevalence of bovine coronavirus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis and Pasteurella multocida was higher on arrival in comparison with departure, confirming data reported in the literature. Overall, there were nasal microbiota changes in beef steers, with an increase in the prevalence of pathogens associated with BRD after travelling. ABSTRACT: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a serious health and economic problem in the beef industry, which is often associated with transportation and caused by different pathogens. The prevalence of bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1), bovine adenovirus (BAdV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus (BPiV), Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, in the nasal microbiota of beef steers before and after the same long-distance journey from France to southern Italy was documented. Fifty-six Limousine animals of three different shipments, travelling on three different days from February to April, were included. Prior to shipment (T0) and four days after arrival (T1), two DNS/animal were collected and tested by Real Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Univariate logistic regression was carried out, considering time and day as fixed factors and the outcome of qPCR for each pathogen as a dependent categorical dichotomous variable (positive/negative, 1/0). The fact that the number of H. somni positive animals were found to be higher in the third shipment than the first and second one, indicating that this pathogen was already present before loading, is relevant. The prevalence of BCoV, BRSV, M. haemolytica, M. bovis, P. multocida was higher at T1 than T0, suggesting that other factors, such as stress and the epidemiological status of the arrival farm, played a role. The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","The tested animals were not treated before and after transport, and our results are in agreement with the current literature, supporting the hypothesis that the prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling, with an increased risk of pathogens shedding.","['The_tested_animals', 'were', 'not', 'treated', 'before', 'and', 'after', 'transport', ',', 'and', 'our_results', 'are', 'in', 'agreement', 'with', 'the_current_literature', ',', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_prevalence', 'of', 'pathogens', 'related', 'to', 'BRD', 'would', 'increase', 'after', 'travelling', ',', 'with', 'an_increased_risk', 'of', 'pathogens', 'shedding', '.']","The_tested_animals were not treated before and after transport , and our_results are in agreement with the_current_literature , supporting the_hypothesis that the_prevalence of pathogens related to BRD would increase after travelling , with an_increased_risk of pathogens shedding .","['The_tested_animals', 'transport', 'our_results', 'agreement', 'the_current_literature', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_prevalence', 'pathogens', 'BRD', 'an_increased_risk', 'pathogens']"
"The gap junctions (GJs), which form intercellular communicating channels between two apposing cells or form hemichannel with extracellular environment, perform crucial functions to maintain small molecule homeostasis. The central nervous system (CNS) GJs are important for maintenance of myelin sheath and neuronal activity. Connexin (Cx) proteins are building blocks of GJs. Recent cell-biological investigations show that amongst the CNS specific Cxs, the most abundant Cx protein, Cx43 and its oligodendrocytic coupling partner Cx47 primarily important for maintenance of CNS myelin. Recent investigations elucidate that the expression of Cx43 and Cx47 is very important to maintain K+ buffering and nutrient homeostasis in oligodendrocytes, CNS myelin and oligodendrocyte function. The investigations on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient samples and EAE hypothesized that the functional loss of Cx43/Cx47 could be associated with spread of chronic MS lesions. Exploring the mechanism of initial GJ alteration and its effect on demyelination in this model of MS might play a primary role to understand the basis of altered CNS homeostasis, observed during MS.

"BACKGROUND: In Europe, the north-south downhill cline frequency of the chemokine receptor CCR5 allele with a 32-bp deletion (CCR5-Δ32) raises interesting questions for evolutionary biologists. We had suggested first that, in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans, might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. Indeed, statistical analyses suggested strong negative correlations between the allele frequency and historical parameters including the colonization dates by Mediterranean civilisations. The gene flows from colonizers to native populations were extremely low but colonizers are responsible of the spread of several diseases suggesting that the dissemination of parasites in naive populations could have induced a breakdown rupture of the fragile pathocenosis changing the balance among diseases. The new equilibrium state has been reached through a negative selection of the null allele. RESULTS: Most of the human diseases are zoonoses and cat might have been instrumental in the decrease of the allele frequency, because its diffusion through Europe was a gradual process, due principally to Romans; and that several cat zoonoses could be transmitted to man. The possible implication of a feline lentivirus (FIV) which does not use CCR5 as co-receptor is discussed. This virus can infect primate cells in vitro and induces clinical signs in macaque. Moreover, most of the historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-Δ32 allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species which harbor species-specific FIVs. CONCLUSION: We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading. A cat zoonosis, could be the most plausible hypothesis. Future studies could provide if CCR5 can play an antimicrobial role in FIV pathogenesis. Moreover, studies of ancient DNA could provide more evidences regarding the implications of zoonoses in the actual CCR5-Δ32 distribution.",We proposed the hypothesis that the actual European CCR5 allelic frequencies are the result of a negative selection due to a disease spreading.,"['We', 'proposed', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_actual_European_CCR5_allelic_frequencies', 'are', 'the_result', 'of', 'a_negative_selection', 'due', 'to', 'a_disease', 'spreading', '.']",We proposed the_hypothesis that the_actual_European_CCR5_allelic_frequencies are the_result of a_negative_selection due to a_disease spreading .,"['the_hypothesis', 'the_actual_European_CCR5_allelic_frequencies', 'a_negative_selection', 'a_disease spreading']"
"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous β-herpesvirus associated with a number of clinical disorders. Two closely but biologically distinct variants have been described. HHV-6 variant B causes the common childhood disease exhanthem subitum, and although the pathologic characteristics for HHV-6 variant A are less well defined, HHV-6A has been suggested to be more neurotropic. We studied the effect of both HHV-6 variants in an oligodendrocyte cell line (MO3.13). Infection of M03.13 was monitored by cytopathic effect (CPE), quantitative TaqMan PCR for viral DNA in cells and supernatant, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) to detect viral protein expression. HHV-6A infection induced significantly more CPE than infection with HHV-6B. HHV-6B induced an abortive infection associated with a decrease of the initial viral DNA load over time, early RNA expression, and no expression of viral antigen. In contrast, infection with HHV-6A DNA persisted in cells for at least 62 days. During the acute phase of infection with HHV-6A, intracellular and extracellular viral load increased and cells expressed the viral protein IE-2 and gp116/54/64. No HHV-6A RNA or protein was expressed after 30 days post infection, suggesting that HHV-6A formed a latent infection. These studies provide in vitro support to the hypothesis that HHV-6 can actively infect oligodendrocytes. Our results suggest that HHV-6A and HHV-6B have different tropism in MO3.13 cells and that an initially active HHV-6A infection can develop latency. Differences between HHV-6A and -6B infection in different neural cell types may be associated with different neurological diseases.",These studies provide in vitro support to the hypothesis that HHV-6 can actively infect oligodendrocytes.,"['These_studies', 'provide', 'in', 'vitro_support', 'to', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'HHV-6', 'can', 'actively', 'infect', 'oligodendrocytes', '.']",These_studies provide in vitro_support to the_hypothesis that HHV-6 can actively infect oligodendrocytes .,"['These_studies', 'vitro_support', 'the_hypothesis', 'HHV-6', 'oligodendrocytes']"
"Abstract Background and objectives Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) has recently been detected in children with respiratory tract infections (RTI). In order to study whether HBoV1 can cause RTI, we investigated its presence in children with upper RTI (URTI), lower RTI (LRTI) and a control group of children without RTI. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and blood samples were collected from children admitted to hospital with RTI from 6 June 2007 to 28 February 2009 (n =1154), and from children admitted for elective surgery who had no RTI (n =162). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the NPAs were examined for 17 infectious agents including HBoV1. Blood samples were tested with HBoV1-PCR only. Results HBoV1 was detected in NPAs from 10% of patients and 17% of controls. Adjusted for age, gender and the presence of other viruses, HBoV1 was not associated with RTI. In the HBoV1-positive NPAs, at least one other virus was detected in 75% and the virus appeared alone in 25%. Adjusted for age and gender, the detection of HBoV1 as the sole virus was associated with RTI, but not with LRTI. Viraemia was found only in children with RTI. The study showed that it was associated with RTI and LRTI. A high HBoV1-load was associated with LRTI, but not with RTI. No interactions between HBoV1 and other infectious agents were found. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group. However, HBoV1 is common in healthy children.","Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children, because detection of HBoV1 alone, viraemia and high viral load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this age group.","['Conclusions', 'Our_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'HBoV1', 'causes', 'RTI', 'in', 'children', ',', 'because', 'detection', 'of', 'HBoV1', 'alone', ',', 'viraemia', 'and', 'high_viral_load', 'are', 'associated', 'with', 'RTI', 'and/or', 'LRTI', 'in', 'this_age_group', '.']","Conclusions Our_data support the_hypothesis that HBoV1 causes RTI in children , because detection of HBoV1 alone , viraemia and high_viral_load are associated with RTI and/or LRTI in this_age_group .","['Conclusions Our_data support', 'the_hypothesis', 'RTI', 'children', 'detection', 'HBoV1', 'viraemia', 'high_viral_load', 'RTI', 'LRTI', 'this_age_group']"
"As a consequence of innate immune activation granulocytes and macrophages produce hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid (HOCl) via secretion of myeloperoxidase (MPO) to the outside of the cells, where HOCl immediately reacts with proteins. Most proteins that become altered by this system do not belong to the invading microorganism but to the host. While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action. We show in this article that HOCl is able to chemically alter proteins and thus turn them into Idea-Ps (Idea-P = immune defence-altered protein), potent amyloid-like and SH-groups capturing antiviral weapons against HIV-1. HOCl-altered plasma proteins (Idea-PP) have the capacity to bind efficiently and with high affinity to the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120, and to its receptor CD4 as well as to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Idea-PP was able to inhibit viral infection and replication in a cell culture system as shown by reduced number of infected cells and of syncytia, resulting in reduction of viral capsid protein p24 in the culture supernatant. The unmodified plasma protein fraction had no effect. HOCl-altered isolated proteins antithrombin III and human serum albumin, taken as representative examples of the whole pool of plasma proteins, were both able to exert the same activity of binding to gp120 and inhibition of viral proliferation. These data offer an opportunity to improve the understanding of the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and allow the generation of the following hypothetical scheme: natural immune defense mechanisms generate by posttranslational modification of plasma proteins a potent virucidal weapon that immobilizes the virus as well as inhibits viral fusion and thus entry into the host cells. Furthermore simulation of this mechanism in vitro might provide an interesting new therapeutic approach against microorganisms.","While there is no doubt that the myeloperoxidase system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1, we hypothesized that it may have an additional indirect mode of action.","['While', 'there', 'is', 'no_doubt', 'that', 'the_myeloperoxidase_system', 'is', 'capable', 'of', 'directly', 'inactivating', 'HIV-1', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'it', 'may', 'have', 'an_additional_indirect_mode', 'of', 'action', '.']","While there is no_doubt that the_myeloperoxidase_system is capable of directly inactivating HIV-1 , we hypothesized that it may have an_additional_indirect_mode of action .","['no_doubt', 'the_myeloperoxidase_system', 'HIV-1', 'an_additional_indirect_mode', 'action']"
"BACKGROUND: Household transmission of influenza-like illness (ILI) may vary with viral and demographic characteristics. We examined the effect of these factors in a population-based sample of adults with ILI. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in community-dwelling Australian adults nested within an influenza vaccine effectiveness trial. On presentation with ILI, participants were swabbed for a range of respiratory viruses and asked to return a questionnaire collecting details of household members with or without similar symptoms. We used logistic and Poisson regression to assess the key characteristics of household transmission. RESULTS: 258 participants from multi-occupancy households experienced 279 ILI episodes and returned a questionnaire. Of these, 183 were the primary case in the household allowing assessment of factors associated with transmission. Transmission was significantly associated in univariate analyses with female sex (27% vs. 13%, risk ratio (RR) = 2.13 (1.08, 4.21)) and the presence of a child in the house (33% vs. 17%, RR = 1.90 (1.11, 3.26)). The secondary household attack proportion (SHAP) was 0.14, higher if influenza was isolated (RR = 2.1 (1.0, 4.5)). Vaccinated participants who nonetheless became infected with influenza had a higher SHAP (Incidence RR = 5.24 (2.17, 12.6)). CONCLUSIONS: The increased SHAP in households of vaccinated participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza infection supports the hypothesis that in years of vaccine mismatch, not only is influenza vaccine less protective for the vaccine recipient, but that the population’s immunity is also lower.","The increased SHAP in households of vaccinated participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza infection supports the hypothesis that in years of vaccine mismatch, not only is influenza vaccine less protective for the vaccine recipient, but that the population","['The_increased_SHAP', 'in', 'households', 'of', 'vaccinated_participants', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'had', 'confirmed', 'influenza_infection', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'in', 'years', 'of', 'vaccine_mismatch', ',', 'not', 'only', 'is', 'influenza_vaccine', 'less', 'protective', 'for', 'the_vaccine_recipient', ',', 'but', 'that', 'the_population']","The_increased_SHAP in households of vaccinated_participants who nonetheless had confirmed influenza_infection supports the_hypothesis that in years of vaccine_mismatch , not only is influenza_vaccine less protective for the_vaccine_recipient , but that the_population","['The_increased_SHAP', 'households', 'vaccinated_participants', 'influenza_infection', 'the_hypothesis', 'years', 'vaccine_mismatch', 'influenza_vaccine', 'the_vaccine_recipient', 'the_population']"
"Base on the sequence of S genes, which encode spike proteins, we previously identified three different types (North American, S INDEL, and S large-DEL types) of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that have re-emerged in Japan since 2013. Based on experimental infections with the North American and S large-DEL types, we also hypothesized that PEDV virulence may be linked to the S1 subunit of the S protein. To test this hypothesis, we have now assayed in gnotobiotic piglets various recombinant PEDVs generated by reverse genetics. Piglets inoculated with CV777 maintained in National Institute of Animal Health, along with piglets infected with a recombinant form of the same virus, developed subclinical to mild diarrhea. In contrast, severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, astasia, and high mortality were observed in piglets inoculated with recombinant strains in which the S gene was partially or fully replaced with corresponding sequences from the highly virulent Japanese PEDV isolate OKN-1/JPN/2013. Indeed, symptoms resembled those in piglets inoculated with the OKN-1/JPN/2013, and were especially pronounced in younger piglets. Collectively, the data demonstrate that the S1 subunit of the S protein is an important determinant of PEDV virulence, and advance development of new vaccine candidate.","Based on experimental infections with the North American and S large-DEL types, we also hypothesized that PEDV virulence may be linked to the S1 subunit of the S protein.","['Based', 'on', 'experimental_infections', 'with', 'the_North_American', 'and', 'S', 'large-DEL_types', ',', 'we', 'also', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'PEDV_virulence', 'may', 'be', 'linked', 'to', 'the_S1_subunit', 'of', 'the_S_protein', '.']","Based on experimental_infections with the_North_American and S large-DEL_types , we also hypothesized that PEDV_virulence may be linked to the_S1_subunit of the_S_protein .","['experimental_infections', 'the_North_American', 'S', 'large-DEL_types', 'PEDV_virulence', 'the_S1_subunit', 'the_S_protein']"
"Dromedary camels are the most likely source for the coronavirus that sporadically causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. Serological results from archived camel sera provide evidence for circulation of MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among dromedary camels in the Greater Horn of Africa as far back as 1983 and in Saudi Arabia as far back as 1992. High seroprevalences of MERS-CoV antibodies and the high virus prevalence in Saudi Arabian dromedary camels indicate an endemicity of the virus in the Arabian Peninsula, which predates the 2012 human MERS index case. Saudi Arabian dromedary camels show significantly higher MERS-CoV carrier rates than dromedary camels imported from Africa. Two MERS-CoV lineages identified in Nigerian camels were found to be genetically distinct from those found in camels and humans in the Middle East.

"Two factors dominated the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2002–2003 global outbreak, namely super-spreading events (SSE) and hospital infections. Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission. We propose that in future outbreaks of SARS or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens, simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control.","These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses.","['These_estimates', 'described', 'levels', 'of', 'transmission', 'between', 'the_index_super-spreader', ',', 'staff', 'and', 'patients', ',', 'and', 'were', 'used', 'to', 'compare', 'three_plausible_hypotheses', '.']","These_estimates described levels of transmission between the_index_super-spreader , staff and patients , and were used to compare three_plausible_hypotheses .","['These_estimates', 'levels', 'transmission', 'staff', 'patients', 'three_plausible_hypotheses']"
"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus that lacks the herpesviral neurovirulence protein ICP34.5. The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity. We selected the vacuolar proton ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 for analysis because of its well-known antiautophagy property of impeding acidification during the late stage of autophagic flux. We documented that bafilomycin treatment from 48 to 72 h postinfection lowered VZV titers substantially (P ≤ 0.008). Because we were unable to define the site of the block in the infectious cycle by confocal microscopy, we turned to electron microscopy. Capsids were observed in the nucleus, in the perinuclear space, and in the cytoplasm adjacent to Golgi apparatus vesicles. Many of the capsids had an aberrant appearance, as has been observed previously in infections not treated with bafilomycin. In contrast to prior untreated infections, however, secondary envelopment of capsids was not seen in the trans-Golgi network, nor were prototypical enveloped particles with capsids (virions) seen in cytoplasmic vesicles after bafilomycin treatment. Instead, multiple particles with varying diameters without capsids (light particles) were seen in large virus assembly compartments near the disorganized Golgi apparatus. Bafilomycin treatment also led to increased numbers of multivesicular bodies in the cytoplasm, some of which contained remnants of the Golgi apparatus. In summary, we have defined a previously unrecognized property of bafilomycin whereby it disrupted the site of secondary envelopment of VZV capsids by altering the pH of the trans-Golgi network and thereby preventing the correct formation of virus assembly compartments. IMPORTANCE This study of VZV assembly in the presence of bafilomycin A1 emphasizes the importance of the Golgi apparatus/trans-Golgi network as a platform in the alphaherpesvirus life cycle. We have previously shown that VZV induces levels of autophagy far above the basal levels of autophagy in human skin, a major site of VZV assembly. The current study documented that bafilomycin treatment led to impaired assembly of VZV capsids after primary envelopment/de-envelopment but before secondary reenvelopment. This VZV study also complemented prior herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus studies investigating two other inhibitors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus function: brefeldin A and monensin. Studies with porcine herpesvirus demonstrated that primary enveloped particles accumulated in the perinuclear space in the presence of brefeldin A, while studies with herpes simplex virus 1 documented an impaired secondary assembly of enveloped viral particles in the presence of monensin.",The underlying hypothesis of this project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV infectivity.,"['The_underlying_hypothesis', 'of', 'this_project', 'was', 'that', 'inhibitors', 'of', 'autophagy', 'reduce', 'VZV_infectivity', '.']",The_underlying_hypothesis of this_project was that inhibitors of autophagy reduce VZV_infectivity .,"['The_underlying_hypothesis', 'this_project', 'inhibitors', 'reduce', 'VZV_infectivity']"
"The dynamics of disease transmission strongly depends on the properties of the population contact network. Pair-approximation models and individual-based network simulation have been used extensively to model contact networks with non-trivial properties. In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain, we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network and rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified based on some biological hypotheses. The main result of the paper is the illustration of the link between graph automorphisms and the process of lumping whereby the number of equations in a system of linear differential equations can be significantly reduced. The main advantage of lumping is that the simplified lumped system is not an approximation of the original system but rather an exact version of this. For a special class of graphs, we show how the lumped system can be obtained by using graph automorphisms. Finally, we discuss the advantages and possible applications of exact epidemic models and lumping.","In this paper, using a continuous time Markov chain, we start from the exact formulation of a simple epidemic model on an arbitrary contact network and rigorously derive and prove some known results that were previously mainly justified based on some biological hypotheses.","['In', 'this_paper', ',', 'using', 'a_continuous_time', 'Markov_chain', ',', 'we', 'start', 'from', 'the_exact_formulation', 'of', 'a_simple_epidemic_model', 'on', 'an_arbitrary_contact_network', 'and', 'rigorously', 'derive', 'and', 'prove', 'some_known_results', 'that', 'were', 'previously', 'mainly', 'justified', 'based', 'on', 'some_biological_hypotheses', '.']","In this_paper , using a_continuous_time Markov_chain , we start from the_exact_formulation of a_simple_epidemic_model on an_arbitrary_contact_network and rigorously derive and prove some_known_results that were previously mainly justified based on some_biological_hypotheses .","['this_paper', 'a_continuous_time Markov_chain', 'the_exact_formulation', 'a_simple_epidemic_model', 'an_arbitrary_contact_network', 'some_known_results', 'some_biological_hypotheses']"
"OBJECTIVES: Despite its extensive use, the term %22Surveillance%22 often takes on various meanings in the scientific literature pertinent to public health and animal health. A critical appraisal of this literature also reveals ambiguities relating to the scope and necessary structural components underpinning the surveillance process. The authors hypothesized that these inconsistencies translate to real or perceived deficiencies in the conceptual framework of population health surveillance. This paper presents a population health surveillance theory framed upon an explicit conceptual system relative to health surveillance performed in human and animal populations. METHODS: The population health surveillance theory reflects the authors' system of thinking and was based on a creative process. RESULTS: Population health surveillance includes two broad components: one relating to the human organization (which includes expertise and the administrative program), and one relating to the system per se (which includes elements of design and method) and which can be viewed as a process. The population health surveillance process is made of five sequential interrelated steps: 1) a trigger or need, 2) problem formulation, 3) surveillance planning, 4) surveillance implementation, and 5) information communication and audit.

"Transspecies transmission of retroviruses is a frequent event, and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is a well-known example. The gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GaLV) and koala retrovirus (KoRV), two gammaretroviruses, are also the result of a transspecies transmission, however from a still unknown host. Related retroviruses have been found in Southeast Asian mice although the sequence similarity was limited. Viruses with a higher sequence homology were isolated from Melomys burtoni, the Australian and Indonesian grassland melomys. However, only the habitats of the koalas and the grassland melomys in Australia are overlapping, indicating that the melomys virus may not be the precursor of the GaLV. Viruses closely related to GaLV/KoRV were also detected in bats. Therefore, given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in Thailand and the koalas in Australia are far away, and that bats are able to fly over long distances, the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration. Analysis of previous transspecies transmissions of retroviruses may help to evaluate the potential of transmission of related retroviruses in the future, e.g., that of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) during xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs.","Therefore, given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in Thailand and the koalas in Australia are far away, and that bats are able to fly over long distances, the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration.","['Therefore', ',', 'given', 'the_fact', 'that', 'the_habitats', 'of', 'the_gibbons', 'in', 'Thailand', 'and', 'the_koalas', 'in', 'Australia', 'are', 'far', 'away', ',', 'and', 'that', 'bats', 'are', 'able', 'to', 'fly', 'over', 'long_distances', ',', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'retroviruses', 'of', 'bats', 'are', 'the_origin', 'of', 'GaLV', 'and', 'KoRV', 'deserves', 'consideration', '.']","Therefore , given the_fact that the_habitats of the_gibbons in Thailand and the_koalas in Australia are far away , and that bats are able to fly over long_distances , the_hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the_origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration .","['the_fact', 'the_habitats', 'the_gibbons', 'Thailand', 'the_koalas', 'Australia', 'bats', 'long_distances', 'the_hypothesis', 'bats', 'the_origin', 'GaLV', 'KoRV', 'consideration']"
"Progress in combatting zoonoses that emerge from wildlife is often constrained by limited knowledge of the biology of pathogens within reservoir hosts. We focus on the host–pathogen dynamics of four emerging viruses associated with bats: Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. Spillover of bat infections to humans and domestic animals often coincides with pulses of viral excretion within bat populations, but the mechanisms driving such pulses are unclear. Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections. First, pulses of viral excretion could reflect seasonal epidemic cycles driven by natural variations in population densities and contact rates among hosts. If lifelong immunity follows recovery, viruses may disappear locally but persist globally through migration; in either case, new outbreaks occur once births replenish the susceptible pool. Second, epidemic cycles could be the result of waning immunity within bats, allowing local circulation of viruses through oscillating herd immunity. Third, pulses could be generated by episodic shedding from persistently infected bats through a combination of physiological and ecological factors. The three scenarios can yield similar patterns in epidemiological surveys, but strategies to predict or manage spillover risk resulting from each scenario will be different. We outline an agenda for research on viruses emerging from bats that would allow for differentiation among the scenarios and inform development of evidence-based interventions to limit threats to human and animal health. These concepts and methods are applicable to a wide range of pathogens that affect humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.",Three hypotheses dominate current research on these emerging bat infections.,"['Three_hypotheses', 'dominate', 'current_research', 'on', 'these_emerging_bat_infections', '.']",Three_hypotheses dominate current_research on these_emerging_bat_infections .,"['Three_hypotheses', 'current_research', 'these_emerging_bat_infections']"
"Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that acts in all living systems as a homeostatic network regulator through many pathways, which are adenosine receptor (AR)-dependent and -independent. From a metabolic point of view, adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an essential protein in the regulation of the total intracellular and extracellular adenosine in a tissue. In addition to its cytosolic localization, ADA is also expressed as an ecto-enzyme on the surface of different cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26) and some ARs act as binding proteins for extracellular ADA in humans. Since CD26 and ARs interact with ADA at opposite sites, we have investigated if ADA can function as a cell-to-cell communication molecule by bridging the anchoring molecules CD26 and A(2A)R present on the surfaces of the interacting cells. By combining site-directed mutagenesis of ADA amino acids involved in binding to A(2A)R and a modification of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique that allows detection of interactions between two proteins expressed in different cell populations with low steric hindrance (NanoBRET), we show direct evidence of the specific formation of trimeric complexes CD26-ADA-A(2A)R involving two cells. By dynamic mass redistribution assays and ligand binding experiments, we also demonstrate that A(2A)R-NanoLuc fusion proteins are functional. The existence of this ternary complex is in good agreement with the hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells (expressing CD26) and dendritic cells (expressing A(2A)R). This is a new metabolic function for ecto-ADA that, being a single chain protein, it has been considered as an example of moonlighting protein, because it performs more than one functional role (as a catalyst, a costimulator, an allosteric modulator and a cell-to-cell connector) without partitioning these functions in different subunits.",The existence of this ternary complex is in good agreement with the hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells (expressing CD26) and dendritic cells (expressing A(2A)R).,"['The_existence', 'of', 'this_ternary_complex', 'is', 'in', 'good_agreement', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'ADA', 'could', 'bridge', 'T-cells', '(', 'expressing_CD26', ')', 'and', 'dendritic_cells', '(', 'expressing', 'A(2A)R', ')', '.']",The_existence of this_ternary_complex is in good_agreement with the_hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells ( expressing_CD26 ) and dendritic_cells ( expressing A(2A)R ) .,"['The_existence', 'this_ternary_complex', 'good_agreement', 'the_hypothesis', 'ADA', 'T-cells', '( expressing_CD26', 'dendritic_cells', 'A(2A)R']"
"BACKGROUND: On the base of our previous study we were observed relevant studies on the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R), a flavonoid, won't relate ability of its antioxidant. METHODS: We were investigated the effects of Q7R on the cytopathic effects (CPE) by CPE reduction assay. Production of DNA fragment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PEDV infection were studied using DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the course of this study it was discovered that Q7R is an extremely potent compound against PEDV. The addition of Q7R to PEDV-infected Vero cells directly reduced the formation of a visible cytopathic effect (CPE). Also, Q7R did not induce DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, ROS increased the infection of PEDV, which was strongly decreased by N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC). However, the increased ROS was not decreased by Q7R. Antiviral activity of antioxidants such as NAC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and the vitamin E derivative, trolox, were hardly noticed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the inhibition of PEDV production by Q7R is not simply due to a general action as an antioxidants and is highly specific, as several other antioxidants (NAC, PDTC, trolox) are inactive against PEDV infection.","On the base of our previous study we were observed relevant studies on the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R), a flavonoid, won't relate ability of its antioxidant.","['On', 'the_base', 'of', 'our_previous_study', 'we', 'were', 'observed', 'relevant_studies', 'on', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_antiviral_activity', 'of', 'quercetin', '7-rhamnoside_(Q7R', ')', ',', 'a_flavonoid', ',', 'wo', ""n't"", 'relate', 'ability', 'of', 'its_antioxidant', '.']","On the_base of our_previous_study we were observed relevant_studies on the_hypothesis that the_antiviral_activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside_(Q7R ) , a_flavonoid , wo n't relate ability of its_antioxidant .","['the_base', 'our_previous_study', 'relevant_studies', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_antiviral_activity', 'quercetin 7-rhamnoside_(Q7R', 'a_flavonoid', 'ability', 'its_antioxidant']"
"Immunological checkpoints, such as the inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R), play a dual role in balancing the immune system during microbial infection. On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen. We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models. We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice. MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans. We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200(−/−) mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro. In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling. However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females. Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection. Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.",We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling.,"['We', 'therefore', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'CD200R_ligation', 'suppresses', 'TLR7_responses', 'and', 'that_release', 'of', 'this_inhibition', 'enlarges', 'sex_differences', 'in', 'TLR7', 'signaling', '.']",We therefore hypothesize that CD200R_ligation suppresses TLR7_responses and that_release of this_inhibition enlarges sex_differences in TLR7 signaling .,"['CD200R_ligation', 'TLR7_responses', 'that_release', 'this_inhibition', 'sex_differences', 'TLR7']"
"Infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been associated with villous atrophy within 48 h, which seriously disrupts intestinal homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we found that TGEV infection severely disrupted intestinal homeostasis via inhibition of self-renewal and differentiation in Lgr5 intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Profoundly, TGEV-encoded NSP10/NSP16 protein complex-mediated the inactivation of Notch signaling provided a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon. Initial invasions by TGEV-targeted Paneth cells through aminopeptidase N (APN) receptor, then inducing mitochondrial damage and ROS generation in them, ultimately causing Paneth cell decrease and loss of Notch factors (DII4 and Hes5), which are essential for Lgr5 ISCs self-renewal and differentiation. Interestingly, loss of Notch signaling induced goblet cells differentiation at the cost of absorptive enterocytes and promoted mucins secretion, which accelerated TGEV replication. Therefore, the more differentiation of goblet cells, the greater TGEV infection in jejunum. These results provide a detailed mechanistic pathway by which villous atrophy sharply occurs in TGEV-infected jejunum within 48 h. Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis. Together, our findings provide a potential link between diarrheal virus infection and crypt cells response that regulates Paneth cells function and Lgr5 ISCs fate and could be exploited for therapeutic application.","Thus, the pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a “bottom up scenario”, which is contrary to the traditional “top down” hypothesis.","['Thus', ',', 'the_pathogenesis', 'of', 'TGEV', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'as', 'a_“bottom_up_scenario', '”', ',', 'which', 'is', 'contrary', 'to', 'the_traditional_“top_down”_hypothesis', '.']","Thus , the_pathogenesis of TGEV can be described as a_“bottom_up_scenario ” , which is contrary to the_traditional_“top_down”_hypothesis .","['TGEV', 'a_“bottom_up_scenario', 'the_traditional_“top_down”_hypothesis']"
"The emergence of Variola virus-like viruses by natural evolution of zoonotic Orthopoxviruses, like Cowpox virus (CPXV), is a global health threat. The proteasome is essential for poxvirus replication, making the viral components interacting with the ubiquitin-proteasome system attractive antiviral targets. We show that proteasome inhibition impairs CPXV replication by prevention of uncoating, suggesting that uncoating is mediated by proteasomal degradation of viral core proteins. Although Orthopoxvirus particles contain considerable amounts of ubiquitin, distinct modification sites are largely unknown. Therefore, for the first time, we analyzed globally ubiquitination sites in CPXV mature virion proteins using LC-MS/MS. Identification of 137 conserved sites in 54 viral proteins among five CPXV strains revealed extensive ubiquitination of structural core proteins. Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly. However, quantitative analysis of ubiquitinated CPXV proteins early in infection showed no proteasomal degradation of core proteins. Instead, our data indicate that the recently suggested proteasomal regulation of the uncoating factor E5 is a prerequisite for uncoating. Expanding our understanding of poxvirus uncoating and elucidating a multitude of novel ubiquitination sites in poxvirus proteins, the present study verifies the major biological significance of ubiquitin in poxvirus infection.","Moreover, since virions contained primarily K48-linked polyubiquitin, we hypothesized that core proteins are modified accordingly.","['Moreover', ',', 'since', 'virions', 'contained', 'primarily', 'K48-linked_polyubiquitin', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'core_proteins', 'are', 'modified', 'accordingly', '.']","Moreover , since virions contained primarily K48-linked_polyubiquitin , we hypothesized that core_proteins are modified accordingly .","['virions', 'primarily K48-linked_polyubiquitin', 'core_proteins']"
"Autoreactive T cells specific for myelin basic protein (MBP), a major component of central nervous system (CNS) protein, are frequently found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis. This autoimmune syndrome is a CNS complication after infections with a number of different enveloped viruses, e.g. mumps, measles, rubella, influenza and varicella. However, the pathophysiological mechanism leading to this breaking of natural self tolerance in the course of viral infection remains an enigma. A long-lasting hypothesis has suggested that incorporation of cellular (self) proteins into the envelope of budding viruses might be a possible mechanism leading to autosensitization. In a model study we demonstrate here that vesicular stomatitis virus (VS V), grown in myelin protein-expressing cell cultures, is highly efficient in triggering T cell responses to MBP in vitro and can prime autoreactive T cell immune responses in vivo. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that incorporation of CNS membrane components into the viral envelope and subsequent priming of self-reactive immune responses might be the common pathogenic mechanism underlying the postinfectious encephalomyelitis syndrome.",A long-lasting hypothesis has suggested that incorporation of cellular (self) proteins into the envelope of budding viruses might be a possible mechanism leading to autosensitization.,"['A_long-lasting_hypothesis', 'has', 'suggested', 'that', 'incorporation', 'of', 'cellular', '(', 'self', ')', 'proteins', 'into', 'the_envelope', 'of', 'budding_viruses', 'might', 'be', 'a_possible_mechanism', 'leading', 'to', 'autosensitization', '.']",A_long-lasting_hypothesis has suggested that incorporation of cellular ( self ) proteins into the_envelope of budding_viruses might be a_possible_mechanism leading to autosensitization .,"['A_long-lasting_hypothesis', 'incorporation', 'self', 'the_envelope', 'budding_viruses', 'a_possible_mechanism', 'autosensitization']"
"Dengue viruses (DENV) are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. There are four genetically distinct serotypes designated DENV-1 through DENV-4, each further subdivided into distinct genotypes. The dengue scientific community has long contended that infection with one serotype confers lifelong protection against subsequent infection with the same serotype, irrespective of virus genotype. However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain. As dengue vaccine trials move increasingly into field-testing, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better define the role of genotypic variation in DENV infection and immunity. To better understand genotypic variation in DENV-3 neutralization and protection, we designed and constructed a panel of isogenic, recombinant DENV-3 infectious clones, each expressing an envelope glycoprotein from a different DENV-3 genotype; Philippines 1982 (genotype I), Thailand 1995 (genotype II), Sri Lanka 1989 and Cuba 2002 (genotype III) and Puerto Rico 1977 (genotype IV). We used the panel to explore how natural envelope variation influences DENV-polyclonal serum interactions. When the recombinant viruses were tested in neutralization assays using immune sera from primary DENV infections, neutralization titers varied by as much as ∼19-fold, depending on the expressed envelope glycoprotein. The observed variability in neutralization titers suggests that relatively few residue changes in the E glycoprotein may have significant effects on DENV specific humoral immunity and influence antibody mediated protection or disease enhancement in the setting of both natural infection and vaccination. These genotypic differences are also likely to be important in temporal and spatial microevolution of DENV-3 in the background of heterotypic neutralization. The recombinant and synthetic tools described here are valuable for testing hypotheses on genetic determinants of DENV-3 immunopathogenesis.",However this hypothesis is under increased scrutiny and the role of DENV genotypic variation in protection from repeated infection is less certain.,"['However', 'this_hypothesis', 'is', 'under', 'increased_scrutiny', 'and', 'the_role', 'of', 'DENV_genotypic_variation', 'in', 'protection', 'from', 'repeated_infection', 'is', 'less', 'certain', '.']",However this_hypothesis is under increased_scrutiny and the_role of DENV_genotypic_variation in protection from repeated_infection is less certain .,"['increased_scrutiny', 'the_role', 'DENV_genotypic_variation', 'protection', 'repeated_infection']"
"PURPOSE AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) is a potent cytokine and FDA-approved anti-cancer drug. However, its clinical use has been limited by severe toxicity, associated primarily with systemic administration with excess protein distributing freely throughout the body. We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate forms permitting more restricted localization may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity. Here, we have tested the utility of palmitate-derivatized rhIL-2. rhIL-2 was reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide palmitate ester. The resultant lipidated rhIL-2 (pIL-2), when mixed with cells, could spontaneously transfer from solution to cell surfaces. Next, anticancer efficacy of pIL-2 was assessed in two modalities. For adoptive T cell therapy, antitumor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were protein transferred (“painted”) with pIL-2 and injected into mice bearing lymphoma. For in situ therapy, pIL-2 was injected intratumorally into mice bearing melanoma. Tumor growth and IL-2-associated toxicity were determined. RESULTS: In the lymphoma model, painting of the antitumor CTLs with pIL-2 markedly increased their viability and titer. In the melanoma model, intratumoral injection of pIL-2, but not rhIL-2, increased the number of activated CD8(+) T cells (IFN-γ(+)) in the spleen, reduced lung metastasis and prolonged the survival of treated mice. Moreover, while repeated intratumoral injection of rhIL-2 at an excessively high dose (10 injections of 10000 IU/mouse) caused marked vascular leakage syndrome, the same regimen using pIL-2 caused no detectable toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Transferring spontaneously from solution to cell surfaces, pIL-2 may bypass the current limitations of rhIL-2 and, thus, serve as a more effective and tolerable anticancer drug.",We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate forms permitting more restricted localization may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'rhIL-2', 'in', 'alternate_forms', 'permitting', 'more_restricted_localization', 'may', 'exert', 'stronger_antitumor_efficacy', 'and', 'less_toxicity', '.']",We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate_forms permitting more_restricted_localization may exert stronger_antitumor_efficacy and less_toxicity .,"['alternate_forms', 'more_restricted_localization', 'stronger_antitumor_efficacy', 'less_toxicity']"
"In leporids, IL17A had been implicated in the host defense against extracellular pathogens, such as Francisella tularensis that infects hares and rabbits and causes the zoonotic disease tularemia. Here, we studied IL17A from five lagomorphs, European rabbit, pygmy rabbit, brush rabbit, European brown hare, and American pika. We observed that this protein is highly conserved between these species, with a similarity of 97–99% in leporids and ~88% between leporids and American pika. The exon/intron structure, N-glycosylation sites, and cysteine residues are conserved between lagomorphs. However, at codon 88, one of the interaction sites between IL17A and its receptor IL17RA, there is an Arg>Pro mutation that only occurs in European rabbit and European brown hare. This could induce critical alterations in the IL17A structure and conformation and consequently modify its function. The differences observed between leporids and humans or rodents might also represent important alterations in protein structure and function. In addition, as for other interleukins, IL17A sequences of human and European rabbit are more closely related than the sequences of human and mouse or European rabbit and mouse.

"BACKGROUND: Although allergic asthma is a complex area with many interacting factors involved, the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ proposes that a lack of exposure to infection during childhood may polarise the immune system towards allergen-reactive Th2-type responses in genetically susceptible individuals. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 μg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy increases susceptibility to influenza. The placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. We hypothesised that exposure of peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) to syncytin-1 would impair responses to H1N1pdm09 influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recombinant syncytin-1 was produced. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the presence and absence of syncytin-1 and compared to responses of PBMCs from pregnant women (n=12). PBMCs were characterised using flow cytometry, release of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-λ, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β were measured by cytometric bead array or ELISA. Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-α, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN-λ (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours. This was significantly impaired in pregnant women (IFN-α; p<0.0001 and IFN-λ; p<0.001). Furthermore, in the presence of syncytin-1, PBMCs demonstrated marked reductions in IFN-α and IFN-λ, while enhanced release of IL-10 as well as IL-6 and IL-1β.

"In contrast to mice or humans, cattle contain three beta interferon (IFN-β) genes with distinct transcriptional promoters suggesting IFN-β gene expression is not stimulated the same by different viruses. To test this hypothesis, we compared expression of the three IFN-β subtypes after infection with a RNA virus, Sendai, versus a large DNA virus, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). Infection of low passage bovine kidney (BK) or established bovine kidney cells (CRIB) with Sendai virus has consistently led to high levels of IFN-β1 RNA. Conversely, infection of CRIB cells, but not BK cells, with BHV-1 increased IFN-β3 RNA levels and to a lesser extent the other two IFN-β subtypes. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide resulted in higher levels of IFN-β1 and IFN-β2 RNA levels after BHV-1 infection. Further studies demonstrated that BHV-1 immediate early and/or early genes were primarily responsible for inhibiting the IFN response in BK cells. The three bovine IFN-β promoters were cloned upstream of a reporter gene construct, and their properties analyzed in transient transfection assays. Only the IFN-β3 promoter was trans-activated by IRF3 (interferon responsive factor 3). IRF7 and double stranded RNA (polyIC) stimulated IFN-β1 and IFN-β3 promoter activity, but not IFN-β2. Relative to the human IFN-β promoter, the IFN-β3 promoter contained fewer nucleotide differences in the positive regulatory domain III (PRD III), PRD IV, and PRD I compared to the IFN-β1 and IFN-β2 promoter. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that virus infection differentially stimulates expression of the three bovine IFN-β genes.","To test this hypothesis, we compared expression of the three IFN-β subtypes after infection with a RNA virus, Sendai, versus a large DNA virus, bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1).","['To', 'test', 'this_hypothesis', ',', 'we', 'compared', 'expression', 'of', 'the_three_IFN-β_subtypes', 'after', 'infection', 'with', 'a_RNA_virus', ',', 'Sendai', ',', 'versus', 'a_large_DNA_virus', ',', 'bovine_herpesvirus', '1', '(', 'BHV-1', ')', '.']","To test this_hypothesis , we compared expression of the_three_IFN-β_subtypes after infection with a_RNA_virus , Sendai , versus a_large_DNA_virus , bovine_herpesvirus 1 ( BHV-1 ) .","['expression', 'the_three_IFN-β_subtypes', 'infection', 'a_RNA_virus', 'Sendai', 'a_large_DNA_virus', 'bovine_herpesvirus', 'BHV-1']"
"T lymphocyte cells, including regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 cells, have important roles in the human periodontium. However, the basis for Treg cytokine expression in various compartments of the periodontium remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin (IL)-35 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), with a view to understanding its role in this disease, and ultimately providing improved treatments. Peripheral blood, periodontal tissues and gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were collected from patients with CP or impacted teeth, the latter serving as healthy controls. The expression levels of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in PBMCs and periodontal tissues were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, while the IL-35 protein expression in GCFs and sera was quantified by ELISA. The relative expression of IL-35 subunit mRNAs in the affected tissues of patients with CP was significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.05). The mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCFs and sera of patients with periodontitis was also significantly higher compared with that in samples from healthy controls (P<0.001). IL-35 protein and periodontal clinical indicators were negatively correlated. It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.","It was hypothesized that the increased level of IL-35 plays a protective role in periodontal disease by maintaining immune system homeostasis and dampening the inflammatory response, and highlights IL-35 as a potential new therapy for the treatment of periodontitis.","['It', 'was', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_increased_level', 'of', 'IL-35', 'plays', 'a_protective_role', 'in', 'periodontal_disease', 'by', 'maintaining', 'immune_system_homeostasis', 'and', 'dampening', 'the_inflammatory_response', ',', 'and', 'highlights', 'IL-35', 'as', 'a_potential_new_therapy', 'for', 'the_treatment', 'of', 'periodontitis', '.']","It was hypothesized that the_increased_level of IL-35 plays a_protective_role in periodontal_disease by maintaining immune_system_homeostasis and dampening the_inflammatory_response , and highlights IL-35 as a_potential_new_therapy for the_treatment of periodontitis .","['the_increased_level', 'IL-35', 'a_protective_role', 'periodontal_disease', 'immune_system_homeostasis', 'the_inflammatory_response', 'highlights', 'IL-35', 'the_treatment', 'periodontitis']"
"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula, and zoonotic transmission to people is a sporadic event. In the absence of epidemiological data on the reservoir species, patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. This study aimed to identify meteorological factors that may increase the risk of primary MERS infections in humans. METHODS: A case-crossover design was used to identify associations between primary MERS cases and preceding weather conditions within the 2-week incubation period in Saudi Arabia using univariable conditional logistic regression. Cases with symptom onset between January 2015 – December 2017 were obtained from a publicly available line list of human MERS cases maintained by the World Health Organization. The complete case dataset (N = 1191) was reduced to approximate the cases most likely to represent spillover transmission from camels (N = 446). Data from meteorological stations closest to the largest city in each province were used to calculate the daily mean, minimum, and maximum temperature ((ο)C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), and visibility (m). Weather variables were categorized according to strata; temperature and humidity into tertiles, and visibility and wind speed into halves. RESULTS: Lowest temperature (Odds Ratio = 1.27; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.04–1.56) and humidity (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.10–1.65) were associated with increased cases 8–10 days later. High visibility was associated with an increased number of cases 7 days later (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.01–1.57), while wind speed also showed statistically significant associations with cases 5–6 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that primary MERS human cases in Saudi Arabia are more likely to occur when conditions are relatively cold and dry. This is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen. This may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions. This analysis provides key initial evidence of an environmental component contributing to the development of primary MERS-CoV infections.","It was hypothesized that low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS, however the opposite relationship was seen.","['It', 'was', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'low_visibility', 'would', 'be', 'positively', 'associated', 'with', 'primary_cases', 'of', 'MERS', ',', 'however', 'the_opposite_relationship', 'was', 'seen', '.']","It was hypothesized that low_visibility would be positively associated with primary_cases of MERS , however the_opposite_relationship was seen .","['primary_cases', 'MERS', 'the_opposite_relationship']"
"The specific packaging of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome is hypothesised to be driven by Core-RNA interactions. To identify the regions of the viral genome involved in this process, we used SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify RNA aptamers which bind specifically to Core in vitro. Comparison of these aptamers to multiple HCV genomes revealed the presence of a conserved terminal loop motif within short RNA stem-loop structures. We postulated that interactions of these motifs, as well as sub-motifs which were present in HCV genomes at statistically significant levels, with the Core protein may drive virion assembly. We mutated 8 of these predicted motifs within the HCV infectious molecular clone JFH-1, thereby producing a range of mutant viruses predicted to possess altered RNA secondary structures. RNA replication and viral titre were unaltered in viruses possessing only one mutated structure. However, infectivity titres were decreased in viruses possessing a higher number of mutated regions. This work thus identified multiple novel RNA motifs which appear to contribute to genome packaging. We suggest that these structures act as cooperative packaging signals to drive specific RNA encapsidation during HCV assembly.",The specific packaging of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome is hypothesised to be driven by Core-RNA interactions.,"['The_specific_packaging', 'of', 'the_hepatitis_C_virus_(HCV)_genome', 'is', 'hypothesised', 'to', 'be', 'driven', 'by', 'Core-RNA_interactions', '.']",The_specific_packaging of the_hepatitis_C_virus_(HCV)_genome is hypothesised to be driven by Core-RNA_interactions .,"['The_specific_packaging', 'the_hepatitis_C_virus_(HCV)_genome', 'Core-RNA_interactions']"
"Phylodynamics has become an increasingly popular statistical framework to extract evolutionary and epidemiological information from pathogen genomes. By harnessing such information, epidemiologists aim to shed light on the spatio-temporal patterns of spread and to test hypotheses about the underlying interaction of evolutionary and ecological dynamics in pathogen populations. Although the field has witnessed a rich development of statistical inference tools with increasing levels of sophistication, these tools initially focused on sequences as their sole primary data source. Integrating various sources of information, however, promises to deliver more precise insights in infectious diseases and to increase opportunities for statistical hypothesis testing. Here, we review how the emerging concept of data integration is stimulating new advances in Bayesian evolutionary inference methodology which formalize a marriage of statistical thinking and evolutionary biology. These approaches include connecting sequence to trait evolution, such as for host, phenotypic and geographic sampling information, but also the incorporation of covariates of evolutionary and epidemic processes in the reconstruction procedures. We highlight how a full Bayesian approach to covariate modeling and testing can generate further insights into sequence evolution, trait evolution, and population dynamics in pathogen populations. Specific examples demonstrate how such approaches can be used to test the impact of host on rabies and HIV evolutionary rates, to identify the drivers of influenza dispersal as well as the determinants of rabies cross-species transmissions, and to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of influenza antigenicity. Finally, we briefly discuss how data integration is now also permeating through the inference of transmission dynamics, leading to novel insights into tree-generative processes and detailed reconstructions of transmission trees.

"Host-derived proteases can augment or help to clear infections. This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl(-/-) mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl(+/+) mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctsl(+/+) mice, although Ctsl(+/+) mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl(-/-) mice had profound deficits in CD4+ lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A.","The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL.","['The_present_study', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'CTSL', 'protects', 'mice', 'from', 'serious_consequences', 'of', 'infection', 'by', 'the_orthomyxovirus_influenza_A', ',', 'which', 'is', 'thought', 'to', 'be', 'activated', 'by', 'host-supplied_proteases', 'other', 'than', 'CTSL', '.']","The_present_study tested the_hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious_consequences of infection by the_orthomyxovirus_influenza_A , which is thought to be activated by host-supplied_proteases other than CTSL .","['The_present_study tested the_hypothesis', 'CTSL', 'mice', 'serious_consequences', 'infection', 'the_orthomyxovirus_influenza_A', 'host-supplied_proteases', 'CTSL']"
"BACKGROUND: Premature beats (PBs) are a common finding in patients suffering from structural heart disease, but they can also be present in healthy individuals. Catheter ablation represents a suitable therapeutic approach. However, the exact localization of the origin can be challenging, especially in cases of low PB burden during the procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an automated mapping algorithm on the basis of the hypothesis that mathematical optimization would significantly accelerate the localization of earliest activation. METHODS: The algorithm is based on iterative regression analyses. When acquiring local activation times (LATs) within a 3-dimensional anatomic map of the corresponding heart chamber, this algorithm is able to identify that exact position where a next LAT measurement adds maximum information about the predicted site of origin. Furthermore, on the basis of the acquired LAT measurements, the algorithm is able to predict earliest activation with high accuracy. RESULTS: A systematic retrospective analysis of the mapping performance comparing the operator with simulated search processes by the algorithm within 17 electroanatomic maps of focal spreading arrhythmias revealed a highly significant reduction of necessary LAT measurements from 55 ± 8.8 to 10 ± 0.51 (n = 17; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: On the basis of mathematical optimization, we developed an algorithm that is able to reduce the number of LAT measurements necessary to locate the site of earliest activation. This algorithm might significantly accelerate the mapping procedure by guiding the operator to the optimal position for the next LAT measurement. Furthermore, the algorithm would be able to predict the site of origin with high accuracy early during the mapping procedure.",The aim of this study was to develop an automated mapping algorithm on the basis of the hypothesis that mathematical optimization would significantly accelerate the localization of earliest activation.,"['The_aim', 'of', 'this_study', 'was', 'to', 'develop', 'an_automated_mapping_algorithm', 'on', 'the_basis', 'of', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'mathematical_optimization', 'would', 'significantly', 'accelerate', 'the_localization', 'of', 'earliest_activation', '.']",The_aim of this_study was to develop an_automated_mapping_algorithm on the_basis of the_hypothesis that mathematical_optimization would significantly accelerate the_localization of earliest_activation .,"['The_aim', 'this_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'mathematical_optimization', 'the_localization', 'earliest_activation']"
"Abstract The pseudoknot is an important RNA structural element that provides an excellent model system for studying the contributions of tertiary interactions to RNA stability and to folding kinetics. RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg2+ significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","['The_greater_mechanical_stability', 'of', 'pseudoknots', 'compared', 'to', 'hairpins', ',', 'and', 'their_kinetic_insensitivity', 'to', 'force', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', '−1_frameshifting', 'depends', 'on', 'the_difficulty', 'of', 'unfolding', 'the_mRNA', '.']","The_greater_mechanical_stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins , and their_kinetic_insensitivity to force supports the_hypothesis that −1_frameshifting depends on the_difficulty of unfolding the_mRNA .","['pseudoknots', 'hairpins', 'their_kinetic_insensitivity', 'force', 'the_hypothesis', '−1_frameshifting', 'the_difficulty', 'the_mRNA']"
"DNA vaccines delivered subcutaneously by gene-gun have generated strong protective and therapeutic immunity in rabbits. Recent studies have shown that peptides delivered by the mucosal routes also stimulate local and systemic immune responses. Since mucosal delivery is easier to administer and more cost-effective when compared to gene-gun delivery, we were interested to learn whether mucosally-delivered peptides would prime protective immunity comparable to that of gene-gun delivered DNA in rabbits. Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model was used to test the hypothesis. We chose an HLA-A2.1 restricted cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) E1 epitope (E1/303–311, MLQEKPFQL) for the peptide immunization studies because it provided complete protection when used as a DNA vaccine. Adjuvant has been widely used to boost immunity for vaccines. In this study, three adjuvants reported to be effective for rabbits (TT helper motif, PADRE and CpG2007) were tested with the peptide vaccine. Peptide alone or fused to TT helper or PADRE to create chimeric peptides was delivered by two mucosal routes (ocular and intranasal) together. Partial protection was found in HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbits when peptide was delivered mucosally in the presence of adjuvant. When a subsequent booster of a half dose of the corresponding DNA vaccine was delivered, complete protections were achieved. We conclude that mucosal peptide immunization can be combined with a single DNA vaccination to provide strong protective immunity in rabbits.",Our newly developed HLA-A2.1 transgenic rabbit model was used to test the hypothesis.,"['Our_newly_developed_HLA-A2.1_transgenic_rabbit_model', 'was', 'used', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', '.']",Our_newly_developed_HLA-A2.1_transgenic_rabbit_model was used to test the_hypothesis .,"['Our_newly_developed_HLA-A2.1_transgenic_rabbit_model', 'the_hypothesis']"
"The primate α-/θ-defensin multigene family encodes versatile endogenous cationic and amphipathic peptides that have broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activity. Although previous studies have reported that α-/θ-defensin (DEFA/DEFT) genes are under birth-and-death evolution with frequent duplication and rapid evolution, the phylogenetic relationships of the primate DEFA/DEFT genes; the genetic bases for the existence of similar antimicrobial spectra among closely related species; and the evolutionary processes involved in the emergence of cyclic θ-defensins in Old World monkeys and their subsequent loss of function in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas require further investigation. In this study, the DEFA/DEFT gene repertoires from primate and treeshrew were collected, followed by detailed phylogenetic, sequence and structure, selection pressure and comparative genomics analyses. All treeshrew, prosimian and simian DEFA/DEFT genes are grouped into two major clades, which are tissue-specific for enteric and myeloid defensins in simians. The simian enteric and myeloid α-defensins are classified into six functional gene clusters with diverged sequences, variable structures, altered functional constraints and different selection pressures, which likely reflect the antimicrobial spectra among closely related species. Species-specific duplication or pseudogenization within each simian cluster implies that the antimicrobial spectrum is ever-shifting, most likely challenged by the ever-changing pathogen environment. The DEFT evolved from the myeloid DEFA8. The prosegment of θ-defensin is detected with adaptive changes coevolving with the new protein fold of mature peptide, coincident with the importance of the prosegment for the correct folding of the mature peptide. Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process.","Lastly, a less-is-hitchhiking hypothesis was proposed as a possible explanation for the expansion of pseudogene DEFTP and the loss of functional DEFT, where the gain or loss of the hitchhiker is determined by its adjacent driver gene during the birth-and-death evolutionary process.","['Lastly', ',', 'a_less-is-hitchhiking_hypothesis', 'was', 'proposed', 'as', 'a_possible_explanation', 'for', 'the_expansion', 'of', 'pseudogene_DEFTP', 'and', 'the_loss', 'of', 'functional_DEFT', ',', 'where', 'the_gain', 'or', 'loss', 'of', 'the_hitchhiker', 'is', 'determined', 'by', 'its_adjacent_driver_gene', 'during', 'the_birth-and-death_evolutionary_process', '.']","Lastly , a_less-is-hitchhiking_hypothesis was proposed as a_possible_explanation for the_expansion of pseudogene_DEFTP and the_loss of functional_DEFT , where the_gain or loss of the_hitchhiker is determined by its_adjacent_driver_gene during the_birth-and-death_evolutionary_process .","['a_possible_explanation', 'the_expansion', 'pseudogene_DEFTP', 'the_loss', 'functional_DEFT', 'the_gain', 'loss', 'the_hitchhiker', 'its_adjacent_driver_gene', 'the_birth-and-death_evolutionary_process']"
"An increasingly asked question is 'can we confidently link bats with emerging viruses?'. No, or not yet, is the qualified answer based on the evidence available. Although more than 200 viruses - some of them deadly zoonotic viruses - have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats, the supposed connections between bats, bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases (except for rabies). However, we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses. In this review, we cover aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats. We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.","We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.","['We', 'provide', 'evolutionary-based_hypotheses', 'to', 'tentatively', 'explain', 'the_viral_transmission_route', 'through', 'mammalian_intermediate_hosts', 'and', 'to', 'explain', 'the_geographic_concentration', 'of', 'most_outbreaks', ',', 'but', 'both', 'are', 'no', 'more', 'than', 'speculations', 'that', 'still', 'require', 'formal_assessment', '.']","We provide evolutionary-based_hypotheses to tentatively explain the_viral_transmission_route through mammalian_intermediate_hosts and to explain the_geographic_concentration of most_outbreaks , but both are no more than speculations that still require formal_assessment .","['evolutionary-based_hypotheses', 'the_viral_transmission_route', 'mammalian_intermediate_hosts', 'the_geographic_concentration', 'most_outbreaks', 'speculations']"
"This study describes two longitudinal serological surveys of European Bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) antibodies in serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) maternity colonies located in the North-East of France. This species is currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir. Multievent capture-recapture models were used to determine the factors influencing bat rabies transmission as this method accounts for imperfect detection and uncertainty in disease states. Considering the period of study, analyses revealed that survival and recapture probabilities were not affected by the serological status of individuals, confirming the capacity of bats to be exposed to lyssaviruses without dying. Five bats have been found with EBLV-1 RNA in the saliva at the start of the study, suggesting they were caught during virus excretion period. Among these bats, one was interestingly recaptured one year later and harbored a seropositive status. Along the survey, some others bats have been observed to both seroconvert (i.e. move from a negative to a positive serological status) and serorevert (i.e. move from a positive to a negative serological status). Peak of seroprevalence reached 34% and 70% in site A and B respectively. On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony. Seroprevalence were affected by significantly higher seroprevalence in summer than in spring. The maximum time observed between successive positive serological statuses of a bat demonstrated the potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least 4 years. At last, EBLV-1 serological status transitions have been shown driven by age category with higher seroreversion frequencies in adults than in juvenile. Juveniles and female adults seemed indeed acting as distinct drivers of the rabies virus dynamics, hypothesis have been addressed but their exact role in the EBLV-1 transmission still need to be specified.","On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony.","['On', 'one', 'of', 'the_2_sites', ',', 'global_decrease', 'of', 'seroprevalence', 'was', 'observed', 'all', 'along', 'the_study_period', 'nuanced', 'by', 'oscillation_intervals', 'of', 'approximately_2–3_years', 'supporting', 'the_oscillation_infection_dynamics', 'hypothesized', 'during', 'a_previous_EBLV-1_study', 'in', 'a_Myotis_myotis_colony', '.']","On one of the_2_sites , global_decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the_study_period nuanced by oscillation_intervals of approximately_2–3_years supporting the_oscillation_infection_dynamics hypothesized during a_previous_EBLV-1_study in a_Myotis_myotis_colony .","['the_2_sites', 'global_decrease', 'seroprevalence', 'the_study_period', 'oscillation_intervals', 'approximately_2–3_years', 'the_oscillation_infection_dynamics', 'a_Myotis_myotis_colony']"
"BACKGROUND: Current tools to predict the severity of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection might be improved by including immunological parameters. We hypothesized that a combination of inflammatory markers would differentiate between severe and mild disease in RSV-infected children. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal samples from 52 RSV-infected children were collected during acute infection and after recovery. Retrospectively, patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity: mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Clinical data, number of flow-defined leukocyte subsets, and cytokine concentrations were compared. RESULTS: Children with severe RSV infection were characterized by young age; lymphocytopenia; increased interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-6 concentrations; and decreased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL-5) concentrations in plasma. The combination of plasma levels of IL-8 and CCL-5, and CD4(+) T-cell counts, with cutoff values of 67 pg/ml, 13 ng/ml, and 2.3 × 10(6)/ml, respectively, discriminated severe from mild RSV infection with 82% sensitivity and 96% specificity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the combination of CD4(+) T-cell counts and IL-8 and CCL-5 plasma concentrations correlates with disease severity in RSV-infected children. In addition to clinical features, these immunological markers may be used to assess severity of RSV infection and guide clinical management.

"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is an economically important enteric coronavirus, with over a 90% mortality rate in neonatal piglets. The virus emerged in the US in 2013, resulting in severe production losses. Effective vaccine development against PEDV is a challenge. Inactivated vaccines are of questionable efficacy. Attenuated vaccines, while more effective, require a relatively long lead development time, are associated with safety concerns and are also unable to prevent new field outbreaks. To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities. We expected the vaccine to be both safe and effective in a piglet challenge model. Following the heat and RNAse treatment, PEDV virions had an intact electron microscopic ultrastructure and were amplified only in the 3rd passage in Vero cells, indicating that diminished replication was achieved in vitro. Strong PEDV spike-protein specific and virus neutralizing antibody responses were elicited in vaccinated piglets. Upon challenge, all vaccinated pigs were protected against fecal viral shedding and intestinal pathology, while the unvaccinated controls were not. The vaccine virus was not detected in the fecal matter of vaccinated pigs prior to challenge; nor did they develop intestinal lesions. Thus, the described approach has significant promise in improving current approaches for PEDV immunization.","To combine the safety and efficacy advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines, respectively, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that subjecting PEDV virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10 min to reversibly unfold structural proteins, followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the genome, would result in a vaccine preparation with intact viral structure/antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities.","['To', 'combine', 'the_safety_and_efficacy_advantages', 'of', 'inactivated', 'and', 'attenuated', 'PEDV_vaccines', ',', 'respectively', ',', 'in', 'this_study', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'subjecting', 'PEDV_virions', 'to', 'heat', 'treatment', 'at', '44°C', 'for', '10_min', 'to', 'reversibly', 'unfold', 'structural_proteins', ',', 'followed', 'by', 'exposure', 'to', 'RNAse', 'to', 'fragment', 'the_genome', ',', 'would', 'result', 'in', 'a_vaccine_preparation', 'with', 'intact', 'viral', 'structure', '/', 'antigenicity', 'but', 'highly', 'diminished', 'replicative', 'abilities', '.']","To combine the_safety_and_efficacy_advantages of inactivated and attenuated PEDV_vaccines , respectively , in this_study , we tested the_hypothesis that subjecting PEDV_virions to heat treatment at 44°C for 10_min to reversibly unfold structural_proteins , followed by exposure to RNAse to fragment the_genome , would result in a_vaccine_preparation with intact viral structure / antigenicity but highly diminished replicative abilities .","['the_safety_and_efficacy_advantages', 'inactivated and attenuated PEDV_vaccines', 'this_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'PEDV_virions', 'treatment', '44°C', 'structural_proteins', 'exposure', 'RNAse', 'the_genome', 'a_vaccine_preparation', 'structure', 'antigenicity', 'abilities']"
"A review of the literature reveals that ozone (O3) exposure can either suppress or enhance immune responsiveness. These disparate effects elicited by O3 exposure depend, in large part, on the experimental design used, the immune parameters examined as well as the animal species studied. Despite the apparent contradictions, a general pattern of response to O3 exposure can be recognized. Most studies indicate that continuous O3 exposure leads to an early (days 0-3) impairment of immune responsiveness followed, with continued exposures, by a form of adaptation to O3 that results in a re-establishment of the immune response. The effects of O3 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which O3 exposure occurred. Whereas O3 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen, O3 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen. Although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung, numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that O3 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity.","Although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung, numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that O3 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity.","['Although', 'most_studies', 'have', 'focused', 'on', 'immune_responses', 'in', 'the_lung', ',', 'numerous_investigators', 'have', 'provided', 'functional_and_anatomical_evidence', 'to', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'O3_exposure', 'can', 'have', 'profound_effects', 'on', 'systemic_immunity', '.']","Although most_studies have focused on immune_responses in the_lung , numerous_investigators have provided functional_and_anatomical_evidence to support the_hypothesis that O3_exposure can have profound_effects on systemic_immunity .","['most_studies', 'immune_responses', 'the_lung', 'numerous_investigators', 'functional_and_anatomical_evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'profound_effects', 'systemic_immunity']"
"BACKGROUND: The genetic element s2m seems to represent one of very few examples of mobile genetic elements in viruses. The function remains obscure and a scattered taxonomical distribution has been reported by numerous groups. METHODS: We have searched GenBank in order to identify all viral accessions that have s2m(−like) sequence motifs. Rigorous phylogenetic analyses and constrained tree topology testing were also performed in order to investigate the apparently mobile nature of s2m. RESULTS: The stem-loop s2m structure can be found in four families of + ssRNA viruses; Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Coronaviridae. In all of these virus families, with the possible exception of Caliciviridae, multiple gains and/or losses of s2m would have to be postulated in order to explain the distribution of this character. CONCLUSIONS: s2m appears to be a mobile genetic element with a unique evolutionary history in all of the four virus families where it can be found.

"Abstract Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is one of the multiple translational recoding processes that fundamentally alters triplet decoding of the messenger RNA by the elongating ribosome. The ability of the ribosome to change translational reading frames in the −1 direction (−1 PRF) is employed by many positive strand RNA viruses, including economically important plant viruses and many human pathogens, such as retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, and coronaviruses, e.g., the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in order to properly express their genomes. −1 PRF is programmed by a bipartite signal embedded in the mRNA and includes a heptanucleotide “slip site” over which the paused ribosome “backs up” by one nucleotide, and a downstream stimulatory element, either an RNA pseudoknot or a very stable RNA stem–loop. These two elements are separated by six to eight nucleotides, a distance that places the 5′ edge of the downstream stimulatory element in direct contact with the mRNA entry channel of the 30S ribosomal subunit. The precise mechanism by which the downstream RNA stimulates −1 PRF by the translocating ribosome remains unclear. This review summarizes the recent structural and biophysical studies of RNA pseudoknots and places this work in the context of our evolving mechanistic understanding of translation elongation.

"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin (ANG) II is involved in experimental hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. METHODS: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O(2)/5% CO(2)) or normoxic (21% O(2)/5% CO(2)) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. RESULTS: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P < 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-α−converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/TACE.

"The phosphoprotein (P) gene of most Paramyxovirinae encodes several proteins in overlapping frames: P and V, which share a common N-terminus (PNT), and C, which overlaps PNT. Overlapping genes are of particular interest because they encode proteins originated de novo, some of which have unknown structural folds, challenging the notion that nature utilizes only a limited, well-mapped area of fold space. The C proteins cluster in three groups, comprising measles, Nipah, and Sendai virus. We predicted that all C proteins have a similar organization: a variable, disordered N-terminus and a conserved, α-helical C-terminus. We confirmed this predicted organization by biophysically characterizing recombinant C proteins from Tupaia paramyxovirus (measles group) and human parainfluenza virus 1 (Sendai group). We also found that the C of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant sequence similarity, indicating a common origin. Although the C of the Sendai group lack sequence similarity with them, we speculate that they also have a common origin, given their similar genomic location and structural organization. Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae. Intriguingly, in measles virus and Nipah virus, PNT encodes STAT1-binding sites that overlap different regions of the C-terminus of C, indicating they have probably originated independently. This arrangement, in which the same genetic region encodes simultaneously a crucial functional motif (a STAT1-binding site) and a highly constrained region (the C-terminus of C), seems paradoxical, since it should severely reduce the ability of the virus to adapt. The fact that it originated twice suggests that it must be balanced by an evolutionary advantage, perhaps from reducing the size of the genetic region vulnerable to mutations.","Since C is dispensable for viral replication, unlike PNT, we hypothesize that C may have originated de novo by overprinting PNT in the ancestor of Paramyxovirinae.","['Since', 'C', 'is', 'dispensable', 'for', 'viral_replication', ',', 'unlike', 'PNT', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'C', 'may', 'have', 'originated', 'de_novo', 'by', 'overprinting', 'PNT', 'in', 'the_ancestor', 'of', 'Paramyxovirinae', '.']","Since C is dispensable for viral_replication , unlike PNT , we hypothesize that C may have originated de_novo by overprinting PNT in the_ancestor of Paramyxovirinae .","['C', 'viral_replication', 'PNT', 'C', 'de_novo', 'PNT', 'the_ancestor', 'Paramyxovirinae']"

"The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the zoonotic potential of Betacoronaviruses. Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression.

"The study of Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) in the affected localities of southern Serbia shows population-genetic difference between samples of BEN affected individuals and control group consisting of non-affected individuals from the same localities.

"BACKGROUND: Emergence and re-emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in North America, Asia and Europe has caused severe economic loss to the global swine industry. However, the virome of PEDV infected pigs and its effect on disease severity remains unknown. The advancements of sequencing technology have made it possible to characterize the entire microbiome of different body sites for any host. METHODS: The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing. Specifically, 217 PEDV-positive swine fecal swab samples collected from diarrheic piglets over 17 US states during 2015–2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: A Kraken algorithm-based bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of up to 9 different RNA genera besides PEDV (Alphacoronavirus genus), including Mamastrovirus (52%, 113/217), Enterovirus (39%, 85/217), Sapelovirus (31%, 67/217), Posavirus (30%, 66/217), Kobuvirus (23%, 49/217), Sapovirus (13%, 28/217), Teschovirus (10%, 22/217), Pasivirus (9%, 20/217), and Deltacoronavirus (3%, 6/217). There were 58 out of 217 piglets (27%) have PEDV infection alone whereas the remaining 159 (73%) shed 2 up to 9 different viruses. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrated that PEDV infected diarrheic pigs had an extensive RNA viral flora consisting of four different families: Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, and Coronaviridae.",The objective of this study was to characterize the RNA virome in PEDV-positive pigs using the hypothesis-free metagenomics approach based on next-generation sequencing.,"['The_objective', 'of', 'this_study', 'was', 'to', 'characterize', 'the_RNA_virome', 'in', 'PEDV-positive_pigs', 'using', 'the_hypothesis-free_metagenomics_approach', 'based', 'on', 'next-generation_sequencing', '.']",The_objective of this_study was to characterize the_RNA_virome in PEDV-positive_pigs using the_hypothesis-free_metagenomics_approach based on next-generation_sequencing .,"['The_objective', 'this_study', 'PEDV-positive_pigs']"
"Multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized by primary destruction of myelin. This review covers recent advances in neuropathology, immunogenetics, neuroimmunology, and neurovirology that have provided insights regarding its pathogenesis. Three hypotheses are discussed: (1) autoimmunity, (2) “bystander” demyelination, and (3) immune destruction of persistently infected oligodendrocytes. A paradigm for induction of primary demyelination is proposed in which immune cells recognize “foreign” antigens on the surface of oligodendrocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex gene products. The final result of this scheme may be “dying-back gliopathy,” the alteration being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocyte—that is, the myelin sheaths.",Three hypotheses are discussed:,"['Three_hypotheses', 'are', 'discussed', ':']",Three_hypotheses are discussed :,['Three_hypotheses']
"Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is endemic in feral cat populations and cat colonies, frequently preceding outbreaks of fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FCoV exhibits 2 biotypes: the pathogenic disease and a benign infection with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Uncertainty remains regarding whether genetically distinctive avirulent and virulent forms coexist or whether an avirulent form mutates in vivo, causing FIP. To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Viral sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and nonstructural protein 7b genes. These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations. In addition, 5 membrane protein amino acid residues with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with FIP. These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent FIP-associated FCoV.","To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses.","['To', 'resolve', 'these_alternative_hypotheses', ',', 'we', 'isolated', 'viral_sequences', 'from', 'FCoV-infected_clinically_healthy_and_sick_cats', '(', '8_FIP_cases', 'and', '48_FECV-asymptomatic_animals', ')', ';', '735_sequences', 'from', '4_gene_segments', 'were', 'generated', 'and', 'subjected', 'to', 'phylogenetic_analyses', '.']","To resolve these_alternative_hypotheses , we isolated viral_sequences from FCoV-infected_clinically_healthy_and_sick_cats ( 8_FIP_cases and 48_FECV-asymptomatic_animals ) ; 735_sequences from 4_gene_segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic_analyses .","['these_alternative_hypotheses', 'viral_sequences', 'FCoV-infected_clinically_healthy_and_sick_cats', '( 8_FIP_cases', '735_sequences', 'phylogenetic_analyses']"
"Abstract The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein (NP) contains a potential RNA-binding region in its N-terminal portion and also serves as a dimerization domain by forming a homodimer with a molecular mass of 28 kDa. So far, the structure determination of the SARS-CoV NP CTD in solution has been impeded by the poor quality of NMR spectra, especially for aromatic resonances. We have recently developed the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method to overcome the size problem of NMR structure determination by utilizing a protein exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically isotope-labeled amino acids. Here, we employed the SAIL method to determine the high-quality solution structure of the SARS-CoV NP CTD by NMR. The SAIL protein yielded less crowded and better resolved spectra than uniform 13C and 15N labeling, and enabled the homodimeric solution structure of this protein to be determined. The NMR structure is almost identical with the previously solved crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. Studies of the chemical shift perturbations caused by the binding of single-stranded DNA and mutational analyses have identified the disordered region at the N-termini as the prime site for nucleic acid binding. In addition, residues in the β-sheet region also showed significant perturbations. Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.","Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.","['Mapping', 'of', 'the_locations', 'of', 'these_residues', 'onto', 'the_helical_model', 'observed', 'in', 'the_crystal', 'revealed', 'that', 'these_two_regions', 'are', 'parts', 'of', 'the_interior_lining', 'of', 'the_positively_charged_helical_groove', ',', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_helical_oligomer', 'may', 'form', 'in', 'solution', '.']","Mapping of the_locations of these_residues onto the_helical_model observed in the_crystal revealed that these_two_regions are parts of the_interior_lining of the_positively_charged_helical_groove , supporting the_hypothesis that the_helical_oligomer may form in solution .","['Mapping', 'the_locations', 'these_residues', 'the_helical_model', 'the_crystal', 'these_two_regions', 'parts', 'the_interior_lining', 'the_positively_charged_helical_groove', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_helical_oligomer', 'solution']"
"Sequence information on the genome of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has only recently been determined. In contrast, very little is known about the viral proteins. In the present report we have identified the membrane glycoprotein (M) of PEDV by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the cloned M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated, and migrates with a relative mobility (Mr) of 27 k in polyacrylamide gels. In contrast, the M protein synthesized by recombinant baculoviruses migrates with a Mr of 23 k, that is, with identical mobility as the deglycosylated product of PEDV. Thus, it appears that M protein specified by the recombinant baculovirus is poorly, if at all, glycosylated. Using monoclonal antibodies and rabbit antipeptide sera specific for the N and C termini of the M protein, we were able to show that a 19 k band detected in PEDV-infected cells but not in virions represented a fragment of M from which the C terminus had been cleaved off. Finally, by electron microscopy and immunogold labelling, the relative orientation of M within the virion envelope was determined as NexoCcyt. In conclusion, all of these data strongly support the hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the group I coronaviruses.","In conclusion, all of these data strongly support the hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the group I coronaviruses.","['In', 'conclusion', ',', 'all', 'of', 'these_data', 'strongly', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'PEDV', 'should', 'be', 'classified', 'with', 'the_group', 'I', 'coronaviruses', '.']","In conclusion , all of these_data strongly support the_hypothesis that PEDV should be classified with the_group I coronaviruses .","['conclusion', 'these_data', 'the_hypothesis', 'PEDV', 'the_group']"
"Motivation: An important aspect of infectious disease research involves understanding the differences and commonalities in the infection mechanisms underlying various diseases. Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of host–pathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called ‘multitask learning’, which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A ‘task’ in our scenario is the set of host–pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host–pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a task-based regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex–Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host–pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.

"This study tested the hypothesis that a set of predominantly myeloid restricted receptors (F4/80, CD36, Dectin-1, CD200 receptor and mannan binding lectins) and the broadly expressed CD200 played a role in a key function of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), virally induced type I interferon (IFN) production. The Dectin-1 ligands zymosan, glucan phosphate and the anti-Dectin-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 had no effect on influenza virus induced IFNα/β production by murine splenic pDC. However, mannan, a broad blocking reagent against mannose specific receptors, inhibited IFNα/β production by pDC in response to inactivated influenza virus. Moreover, viral glycoproteins (influenza virus haemagglutinin and HIV-1 gp120) stimulated IFNα/β production by splenocytes in a mannan-inhibitable manner, implicating the function of a lectin in glycoprotein induced IFN production. Lastly, the effect of CD200 on IFN induction was investigated. CD200 knock-out macrophages produced more IFNα than wild-type macrophages in response to polyI:C, a MyD88-independent stimulus, consistent with CD200's known inhibitory effect on myeloid cells. In contrast, blocking CD200 with an anti-CD200 mAb resulted in reduced IFNα production by pDC-containing splenocytes in response to CpG and influenza virus (MyD88-dependent stimuli). This suggests there could be a differential effect of CD200 on MyD88 dependent and independent IFN induction pathways in pDC and macrophages. This study supports the hypothesis that a mannan-inhibitable lectin and CD200 are involved in virally induced type I IFN induction.","This study tested the hypothesis that a set of predominantly myeloid restricted receptors (F4/80, CD36, Dectin-1, CD200 receptor and mannan binding lectins) and the broadly expressed CD200 played a role in a key function of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), virally induced type I interferon (IFN) production.","['This_study', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'a_set', 'of', 'predominantly', 'myeloid', 'restricted', 'receptors', '(', 'F4/80', ',', 'CD36', ',', 'Dectin-1', ',', 'CD200', 'receptor', 'and', 'mannan', 'binding', 'lectins', ')', 'and', 'the_broadly_expressed_CD200', 'played', 'a_role', 'in', 'a_key_function', 'of', 'plasmacytoid_DC', '(pDC', ')', ',', 'virally', 'induced', 'type', 'I', 'interferon', '(', 'IFN', ')', 'production', '.']","This_study tested the_hypothesis that a_set of predominantly myeloid restricted receptors ( F4/80 , CD36 , Dectin-1 , CD200 receptor and mannan binding lectins ) and the_broadly_expressed_CD200 played a_role in a_key_function of plasmacytoid_DC (pDC ) , virally induced type I interferon ( IFN ) production .","['This_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'receptors', 'F4/80', 'CD36', 'Dectin-1', 'CD200', 'receptor', 'mannan', 'binding', 'lectins', 'the_broadly_expressed_CD200', 'a_role', 'a_key_function', 'plasmacytoid_DC', 'pDC', 'type', 'IFN', 'production']"
"BACKGROUND: Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) represents a chronic progressive interstitial nephritis in striking correlation with uroepithelial tumours of the upper urinary tract. The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing, etc. The significance of CpG island methylation status in normal development, cell differentiation and gene expression is widely recognized, although still stays poorly understood. METHODS: We performed whole genome DNA methylation array analysis on DNA pool samples from peripheral blood from 159 affected individuals and 170 healthy individuals. This technique allowed us to determine the methylation status of 27 627 CpG islands throughout the whole genome in healthy controls and BEN patients. Thus we obtained the methylation profile of BEN patients from Bulgarian and Serbian endemic regions. RESULTS: Using specifically developed software we compared the methylation profiles of BEN patients and corresponding controls and revealed the differently methylated regions. We then compared the DMRs between all patient-control pairs to determine common changes in the epigenetic profiles. SEC61G, IL17RA, HDAC11 proved to be differently methylated throughout all patient-control pairs. The CpG islands of all 3 genes were hypomethylated compared to controls. This suggests that dysregulation of these genes involved in immunological response could be a common mechanism in BEN pathogenesis in both endemic regions and in both genders.

"Abstract Background Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method it is possible to detect uncultivable viruses and discover multiple viral infections. However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. Objectives The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. Study design Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children’s hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. Results Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. Conclusions Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.","Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.","['Because', 'the_infection', 'of', 'rhinoviruses', 'is', 'the_common_occurrence', 'in', 'children', ',', 'it', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_factors', 'related', 'to', 'disease_severity', 'are', 'mainly', 'the_underlying_conditions', 'of', 'the_children', '.']","Because the_infection of rhinoviruses is the_common_occurrence in children , it is hypothesized that the_factors related to disease_severity are mainly the_underlying_conditions of the_children .","['rhinoviruses', 'the_common_occurrence', 'children', 'the_factors', 'disease_severity', 'the_underlying_conditions', 'the_children']"
"In this study we investigate the molecular mechanisms of caspases and mitochondria in the extrinsic and intrinsic signal apoptosis pathways in human leukemia HL-60 cells after in vitro exposure to 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid (18α-GA). Cells were exposed to 18α-GA at various concentrations for various time periods and were harvested for flow cytometry total viable cell and apoptotic cell death measurements. Cells treated with 18α-GA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 100 μM at 48 h. The cell growth inhibition resulted in induction of apoptosis and decreased the mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨ(m)) and increased caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities. Furthermore, cytochrome c and AIF were released from mitochondria, as shown by western blotting and confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. Western blotting showed that 18α-GA increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid and decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, furthermore, results also showed that 18α-GA increased Fas and Fas-L which are associated with surface death receptor in HL-60 cells.

"BACKGROUND: Genetic variants in the inhibiting FcγRIIB mediate anti-inflammatory responses and influence IVIG refractoriness (IVIG-R). However, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations so other genes in the pathway could be potentially involved. IVIG is ineffective in mice lacking SIGN-R1, a related molecule to human DC-SIGN. Further, DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc, the component responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of IVIG. Thus, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN would also be involved in the pathway of IVIG response in Kawasaki Disease (KD) patients. FINDINGS: A case-control approach was performed to examine the differential distribution of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DC-SIGN promoter with IVIG-R among White (158 vs. 62), Asian (64 vs. 12) and Hispanic (55 vs. 20) KD patients. Distinct differences in allele frequency distributions of several variants in the DC-SIGN promoter were observed in the three ethnic groups. Further, Asians with the major allele “A” in rs2287886 were more likely (OR = 1.76, p = 0.04) to be IVIG non-responder, but this allele is a minor allele in other two ethnic groups, where the association was not apparent.

"Background: Theaflavins (TFs) are a category of natural compounds characterized with the benzotropolone skeleton. The prominent benefits of TFs have been well documented. Amount of research were conducted and excellent achievements were disclosed during the past years. However, as far as we know, there is no comprehensive review about TFs. Scope and approach: This review summarized the recent research progress. The activity of TFs on anti-oxidation, anti-mutagenicity, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral effect as well as the epidemiological cure were sorted. Converging pioneer literature and deduction, the underlying formation mechanism of TFs was proposed. Subsequently, acquisition of TFs was pointed out to be the fundament for further research. Accelerated by enzyme, bio-synthesis of TFs were reviewed simultaneously. At the end, employing modern analysis instrument and technology, isolations of TFs were enumerated. Key findings and conclusions: Structure of the skeleton as well as functional groups were paramount related with the bio-activity of TFs.

"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that is associated with the pathogenesis of several human lymphoid malignancies, including Hodgkin's lymphoma. Infection of normal resting B cells with EBV results in activation to lymphoblasts that are phenotypically similar to those generated by physiological stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4. One important difference is that infection leads to the establishment of permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas CD40L/IL-4 blasts have finite proliferation lifespans. To identify early events which might later determine why EBV infected blasts go on to establish transformed cell lines, we performed global transcriptome analyses on resting B cells and on EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts after 7 days culture. As anticipated there was considerable overlap in the transcriptomes of the two types of lymphoblasts when compared to the original resting B cells, reflecting common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Of interest to us was a subset of 255 genes that were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Genes which were more highly expressed in EBV blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for a set of interferon-stimulated genes which on further in silico analyses were found to be repressed by IL-4 in other cell contexts and to be up-regulated in micro-dissected malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma biopsies when compared to their normal germinal center cell counterparts. We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes. This was supported experimentally in our B cell model where IL-4 stimulation partially reversed transcriptional changes which follow EBV infection and it impaired the efficiency of EBV-induced B cell transformation. Taken together, these data suggest that the discordant regulation of interferon and IL-4 pathway genes by EBV that occurs early following infection of B cells has relevance to the development or maintenance of an EBV-associated malignancy.",We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'EBV', 'and', 'IL-4', 'were', 'targeting', 'and', 'discordantly', 'regulating', 'a_common_set', 'of', 'genes', '.']",We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a_common_set of genes .,"['EBV', 'IL-4', 'a_common_set', 'genes']"
"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) constitute the body’s principal source of type I interferon (IFN) and are comparatively abundant in the liver. Among various cytokines implicated in liver ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, type I IFNs have been described recently as playing an essential role in its pathogenesis. Moreover, type I IFNs have been shown to up-regulate hepatocyte expression of IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1), a key transcription factor that regulates apoptosis and induces liver damage after I/R. Our aim was to ascertain the capacity of IFN-α released by liver pDC to induce liver damage through hepatic IRF-1 up-regulation after I/R injury. Our findings show that liver pDC mature and produce IFN-α in response to liver I/R. Liver pDC isolated after I/R induced elevated levels of IRF-1 production by hepatocytes compared with liver pDC isolated from sham-operated mice. Notably, hepatic IRF-1 expression was reduced significantly by neutralizing IFN-α. In vivo, IFN-α neutralization protected the liver from I/R injury by reducing hepatocyte apoptosis. This was associated with impaired expression of IRF-1 and pro-apoptotic molecules such as Fas ligand, its receptor (Fas) and death receptor 5 which are regulated by IRF-1. Furthermore, pDC-depleted mice failed to up-regulate hepatic IFN-α and displayed less liver injury associated with reduced levels of hepatic IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α and hepatocyte apoptosis after I/R compared with controls.

"Abstract Studies of host factors that affect susceptibility to viral infections have led to the possibility of determining the risk of emerging infections in potential host organisms. In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species. Information regarding host susceptibility to virus infection was collected to classify the cross-species infection propensity between hosts. Evolutionary divergence matrices and a sequence similarity scoring program were used to determine the distance and similarity of receptor sequences. The discriminant analysis was validated with cross-validation methods. The results showed that the primary structure of the receptor protein influences host susceptibility to cross-species viral infections. Pair-wise distance, relative distance, and sequence similarity showed the best accuracy in identifying the susceptible group. Based on the results of the discriminant analysis, we constructed ViCIPR (http://lcbb3.snu.ac.kr/ViCIPR/home.jsp), a server-based tool to enable users to easily extract the cross-species infection propensities of specific viruses using a simple two-step procedure. Our sequence-based approach suggests that it may be possible to identify virus transmission between hosts without requiring complex structural analysis. Due to a lack of available data, this method is limited to viruses whose receptor use has been determined. However, the significant accuracy of predictive variables that positively and negatively influence virus transmission suggests that this approach could be improved with further analysis of receptor sequences.","In this study, we constructed a computational framework to estimate the probability of virus transmission between potential hosts based on the hypothesis that the major barrier to virus infection is differences in cell-receptor sequences among species.","['In', 'this_study', ',', 'we', 'constructed', 'a_computational_framework', 'to', 'estimate', 'the_probability', 'of', 'virus_transmission', 'between', 'potential_hosts', 'based', 'on', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_major_barrier', 'to', 'virus_infection', 'is', 'differences', 'in', 'cell-receptor_sequences', 'among', 'species', '.']","In this_study , we constructed a_computational_framework to estimate the_probability of virus_transmission between potential_hosts based on the_hypothesis that the_major_barrier to virus_infection is differences in cell-receptor_sequences among species .","['this_study', 'a_computational_framework', 'the_probability', 'virus_transmission', 'potential_hosts', 'the_hypothesis', 'virus_infection', 'differences', 'cell-receptor_sequences', 'species']"
"Dietary fats and sodium are both palatable and are hypothesized to synergistically contribute to ingestive behavior and thereby obesity. Contrary to this hypothesis, C57BL/6J mice fed a 45% high fat diet exhibited weight gain that was inhibited by increased dietary sodium content. This suppressive effect of dietary sodium upon weight gain was mediated specifically through a reduction in digestive efficiency, with no effects on food intake behavior, physical activity, or resting metabolism. Replacement of circulating angiotensin II levels reversed the effects of high dietary sodium to suppress digestive efficiency. While the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan had no effect in mice fed low sodium, the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD-123,319 suppressed digestive efficiency. Correspondingly, genetic deletion of the AT(2) receptor in FVB/NCrl mice resulted in suppressed digestive efficiency even on a standard chow diet. Together these data underscore the importance of digestive efficiency in the pathogenesis of obesity, and implicate dietary sodium, the renin-angiotensin system, and the AT(2) receptor in the control of digestive efficiency regardless of mouse strain or macronutrient composition of the diet. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of nutrient absorption control physiology, and prompt more uniform assessment of digestive efficiency in animal studies of energy balance.",Dietary fats and sodium are both palatable and are hypothesized to synergistically contribute to ingestive behavior and thereby obesity.,"['Dietary_fats', 'and', 'sodium', 'are', 'both', 'palatable', 'and', 'are', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'synergistically', 'contribute', 'to', 'ingestive_behavior', 'and', 'thereby_obesity', '.']",Dietary_fats and sodium are both palatable and are hypothesized to synergistically contribute to ingestive_behavior and thereby_obesity .,"['Dietary_fats', 'sodium', 'ingestive_behavior', 'thereby_obesity']"
"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), belongs to genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, causes high rates of abortion and fetal malformation in infected ruminants as well as causing neurological disorders, blindness, or lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. RVFV is classified as a category A priority pathogen and a select agent in the U.S., and currently there are no therapeutics available for RVF patients. NSs protein, a major virulence factor of RVFV, inhibits host transcription including interferon (IFN)-β mRNA synthesis and promotes degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). NSs self-associates at the C-terminus 17 aa., while NSs at aa.210–230 binds to Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) to inhibit the activation of IFN-β promoter. Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect. Unexpectedly, we found that RVFV NSs truncated at aa. 6–30, 31–55, 56–80, 81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230, 231–248 or 249–265 lack functions of IFN–β mRNA synthesis inhibition and degradation of PKR. Truncated NSs were less stable in infected cells, while nuclear localization was inhibited in NSs lacking either of aa.81–105, 106–130, 131–155, 156–180, 181–205, 206–230 or 231–248. Furthermore, none of truncated NSs had exhibited significant dominant-negative functions for NSs-mediated IFN-β suppression or PKR degradation upon co-expression in cells infected with RVFV. We also found that any of truncated NSs except for intact NSs does not interact with RVFV NSs even in the presence of intact C-terminus self-association domain. Our results suggest that conformational integrity of NSs is important for the stability, cellular localization and biological functions of RVFV NSs, and the co-expression of truncated NSs does not exhibit dominant-negative phenotype.","Thus, we hypothesize that NSs function(s) can be abolished by truncation of specific domains, and co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with intact NSs will result in the attenuation of NSs function by dominant-negative effect.","['Thus', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that_NSs', 'function(s', ')', 'can', 'be', 'abolished', 'by', 'truncation', 'of', 'specific_domains', ',', 'and', 'co-expression', 'of', 'nonfunctional_NSs', 'with', 'intact_NSs', 'will', 'result', 'in', 'the_attenuation', 'of', 'NSs_function', 'by', 'dominant-negative_effect', '.']","Thus , we hypothesize that_NSs function(s ) can be abolished by truncation of specific_domains , and co-expression of nonfunctional_NSs with intact_NSs will result in the_attenuation of NSs_function by dominant-negative_effect .","['function(s', 'truncation', 'specific_domains', 'co-expression', 'nonfunctional_NSs', 'intact_NSs', 'the_attenuation', 'NSs_function', 'dominant-negative_effect']"
"Background. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and the acute clinical manifestations represent acute on chronic inflammation. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is found in the granules of human neutrophils, with many diverse functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that levels NGAL in blood may reflect the inflammatory process in various stages of coronary artery disease. Methods. We studied 140 patients, with SA 40, UA 35, NSTEMI 40, and STEMI 25, and 20 healthy controls. Serum NGAL was measured upon admission and before coronary angiography. Results. Significant differences were observed in median serum-NGAL(ng/mL) between patients with SA (79.23 (IQR, 37.50–100.32)), when compared with UA (108.00 (68.34–177.59)), NSTEMI (166.49 (109.24–247.20)), and STEMI (178.63 (111.18–305.92)) patients and controls (50.31 (44.30–69.78)) with significant incremental value from SA to STEMI. We observed a positive and significant correlation between serum-NGAL and hs-CRP (spearman coefficient rho = 0.685, P < 0.0001) as well as with neutrophil counts (r = 0.511, P < 0.0001). Conclusions. In patients with coronary artery disease serum levels of NGAL increase and reflect the degree of inflammatory process.

"BACKGROUND: Highly Infectious Diseases (HIDs) are (i) easily transmissible form person to person; (ii) cause a life-threatening illness with no or few treatment options; and (iii) pose a threat for both personnel and the public. Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities' serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit'. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime. CONCLUSION: There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of isolation facilities. With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised.","Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary.","['Due', 'to', 'differences', 'in', 'geography', ',', 'population_density', ',', 'and', 'national', 'response', 'plans', 'it', 'was', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'adherence', 'to', 'recommendations', 'will', 'vary', '.']","Due to differences in geography , population_density , and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary .","['differences', 'geography', 'population_density', 'national response', 'adherence', 'recommendations']"
"Given the manifold ways that depression impairs Darwinian fitness, the persistence in the human genome of risk alleles for the disorder remains a much debated mystery. Evolutionary theories that view depressive symptoms as adaptive fail to provide parsimonious explanations for why even mild depressive symptoms impair fitness-relevant social functioning, whereas theories that suggest that depression is maladaptive fail to account for the high prevalence of depression risk alleles in human populations. These limitations warrant novel explanations for the origin and persistence of depression risk alleles. Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection. Depression risk alleles identified by both candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies were found to be regularly associated with immune responses to infection that were likely to enhance survival in the ancestral environment. Moreover, data support the role of specific depressive symptoms in pathogen host defense including hyperthermia, reduced bodily iron stores, conservation/withdrawal behavior, hypervigilance and anorexia. By shifting the adaptive context of depression risk alleles from relations with conspecifics to relations with the microbial world, the Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) hypothesis provides a novel explanation for how depression can be nonadaptive in the social realm, whereas its risk alleles are nonetheless represented at prevalence rates that bespeak an adaptive function.","Accordingly, studies on risk alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE to examine data supporting the hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the human genome because these alleles promote pathogen host defense, which includes an integrated suite of immunological and behavioral responses to infection.","['Accordingly', ',', 'studies', 'on', 'risk_alleles', 'for', 'depression', 'were', 'identified', 'using', 'PubMed', 'and', 'Ovid_MEDLINE', 'to', 'examine', 'data', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'risk', 'alleles', 'for', 'depression', 'originated', 'and', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'in', 'the_human_genome', 'because', 'these_alleles', 'promote', 'pathogen_host_defense', ',', 'which', 'includes', 'an_integrated_suite', 'of', 'immunological_and_behavioral_responses', 'to', 'infection', '.']","Accordingly , studies on risk_alleles for depression were identified using PubMed and Ovid_MEDLINE to examine data supporting the_hypothesis that risk alleles for depression originated and have been retained in the_human_genome because these_alleles promote pathogen_host_defense , which includes an_integrated_suite of immunological_and_behavioral_responses to infection .","['studies', 'risk_alleles', 'depression', 'PubMed', 'Ovid_MEDLINE', 'data', 'the_hypothesis', 'risk', 'alleles', 'depression', 'the_human_genome', 'these_alleles', 'promote', 'an_integrated_suite', 'immunological_and_behavioral_responses']"
"BACKGROUND: Treatments for autoimmune diseases aim to dampen autoreactivity while preserving normal immune function. In CD4(+) T cells, the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 is a dispensable transcription factor for T cell development and response to primary infection, but promotes expression of target genes, including Il2 and Ifng, under conditions of antigen reencounter. As a result, they are more strongly expressed upon secondary stimulation. Such repeated antigen encounters occur in memory recall responses, in autoimmunity where self-antigen can be recognized multiple times, and in chronic infection where foreign antigen is persistent. Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that Oct1 loss would protect animals from autoimmunity but maintain normal responses to pathogens in the CNS. OBJECTIVE: We used a conditional mouse Oct1 (Pou2f1) allele and a CD4-Cre driver to determine the effect of T cell-specific Oct1 loss on autoimmune- and viral-induced neuroinflammation using an autoantigen-driven EAE model of autoimmunity and a JHMV model of viral infection. RESULTS: Oct1 conditional deletion mitigated clinical scores and reduced infiltrating T cells and cytokine production in the EAE model. Consistently, Oct1-deficient CD4(+) T cells stimulated in vitro showed increased expression of markers associated with T cell anergy, particularly in the absence of co-stimulatory signals. In contrast, anti-viral T cell effector functions are intact in the absence of Oct1, with no changes in neuroinflammation, infiltrating T cells or cytokine production. CONCLUSION: Our findings uncover a significant difference between the effect of Oct1 loss on autoimmune and anti-pathogen responses, which potentially could be exploited for therapeutic benefit.

"Dogs represent the most important domestic reservoir of L. chagasi (syn. L. infantum). A vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible L. chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the “LbSapSal” vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T(0)), during the post-vaccination protocol (T(3rd)) and after early (T(90)) and late (T(885)) times following L. chagasi-challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with “LbSapSal” is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-γ) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-β), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after “LbSapSal” immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the “LbSapSal” vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection.","In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the “LbSapSal” vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection.","['In', 'conclusion', ',', 'these_results', 'confirmed', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_“LbSapSal”_vaccination', 'is', 'a_potential_tool', 'to', 'control', 'the_Leishmania_chagasi_infection', '.']","In conclusion , these_results confirmed the_hypothesis that the_“LbSapSal”_vaccination is a_potential_tool to control the_Leishmania_chagasi_infection .","['conclusion', 'these_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_“LbSapSal”_vaccination', 'a_potential_tool']"
"To determine the genetic and epidemiological relationship of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates from commercial poultry to attenuated live IBV vaccines we conducted a phylogenetic network analysis on the full-length S1 sequence for Arkansas (Ark), Massachusetts (Mass) and Delmarva/1639 (DMV/1639) type viruses isolated in 2015 from clinical cases by 3 different diagnostic laboratories. Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection. This data supports the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses.","This data supports the hypothesis that live attenuated vaccine usage does play a role in the genetic profile of similar IB viruses in the field and phylogenetic network analysis can be used to identify vaccine and vaccine origin isolates, which is important for our understanding of the role live vaccines play in the evolutionary trajectory of those viruses.","['This_data', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'live', 'attenuated_vaccine_usage', 'does', 'play', 'a_role', 'in', 'the_genetic_profile', 'of', 'similar_IB_viruses', 'in', 'the_field', 'and', 'phylogenetic_network_analysis', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'to', 'identify', 'vaccine_and_vaccine_origin_isolates', ',', 'which', 'is', 'important', 'for', 'our_understanding', 'of', 'the_role', 'live', 'vaccines', 'play', 'in', 'the_evolutionary_trajectory', 'of', 'those_viruses', '.']","This_data supports the_hypothesis that live attenuated_vaccine_usage does play a_role in the_genetic_profile of similar_IB_viruses in the_field and phylogenetic_network_analysis can be used to identify vaccine_and_vaccine_origin_isolates , which is important for our_understanding of the_role live vaccines play in the_evolutionary_trajectory of those_viruses .","['This_data', 'the_hypothesis', 'attenuated_vaccine_usage', 'a_role', 'the_genetic_profile', 'similar_IB_viruses', 'the_field', 'phylogenetic_network_analysis', 'vaccine_and_vaccine_origin_isolates', 'our_understanding', 'the_role', 'vaccines', 'the_evolutionary_trajectory', 'those_viruses']"
"The historical role of mitochondria resides in converting the energy released during the oxidation of macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) into adenosine tri-phosphate, a major form of chemically stored energy which sustains cell growth and homeostasis. Beyond this role in bioenergetics regulation, mitochondria play a role in several other cellular processes including lipid metabolism, cellular calcium homeostasis, autophagy and immune responses. Furthermore, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles: as all other cellular endomembranes, they are continuously moving along cytoskeleton, and, most importantly, they constantly interact one with each other by membrane tethering, fusion and fission. This review aims to highlight the tight correlation between the morphodynamics of mitochondria and their biological function(s), in physiological as well as stress conditions, in particular nutrient deprivation, pathogen attack and some human diseases.

"BACKGROUND: The Rhinovirus C (RV-C), first identified in 2006, produce high symptom burdens in children and asthmatics, however, their primary target host cell in the airways remains unknown. Our primary hypotheses were that RV-C target ciliated airway epithelial cells (AECs), and that cell specificity is determined by restricted and high expression of the only known RV-C cell-entry factor, cadherin related family member 3 (CDHR3). METHODS: RV-C15 (C15) infection in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) cultures was assessed using immunofluorescent and time-lapse epifluorescent imaging. Morphology of C15-infected differentiated AECs was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: C15 produced a scattered pattern of infection, and infected cells were shed from the epithelium. The percentage of cells infected with C15 varied from 1.4 to 14.7% depending on cell culture conditions. Infected cells had increased staining for markers of ciliated cells (acetylated-alpha-tubulin [aat], p < 0.001) but not markers of goblet cells (wheat germ agglutinin or Muc5AC, p = ns). CDHR3 expression was increased on ciliated epithelial cells, but not other epithelial cells (p < 0.01). C15 infection caused a 27.4% reduction of ciliated cells expressing CDHR3 (p < 0.01). During differentiation of AECs, CDHR3 expression progressively increased and correlated with both RV-C binding and replication. CONCLUSIONS: The RV-C only replicate in ciliated AECs in vitro, leading to infected cell shedding. CDHR3 expression positively correlates with RV-C binding and replication, and is largely confined to ciliated AECs. Our data imply that factors regulating differentiation and CDHR3 production may be important determinants of RV-C illness severity.

"The Ebola crisis occurred in West-Africa highlights the urgency for its clinical treatments. Currently, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics are available. Several FDA-approved drugs, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), possess selective anti-Ebola activities. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of these drugs remain elusive. By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection. Herein, we demonstrated that the same dosages of SERMs which induced cholesterol accumulation also inhibited Ebola infection. SERMs reduced the cellular sphingosine and subsequently caused endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn led to blocking the Ebola entry. Our study clarified the specific anti-Ebola mechanism of SERMs, even the cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), this mechanism led to the endolysosomal calcium as a critical target for development of anti-Ebola drugs.","By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection.","['By', 'analyzing', 'the_structures', 'of', 'SERMs', 'and', 'their_incidental_biological_activity', '(', 'cholesterol_accumulation', ')', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'this_incidental_biological_activity', 'induced', 'by', 'SERMs', 'could', 'be', 'a_plausible_mechanism', 'as', 'to', 'their_inhibitory_effects', 'on', 'Ebola_infection', '.']","By analyzing the_structures of SERMs and their_incidental_biological_activity ( cholesterol_accumulation ) , we hypothesized that this_incidental_biological_activity induced by SERMs could be a_plausible_mechanism as to their_inhibitory_effects on Ebola_infection .","['the_structures', 'SERMs', 'their_incidental_biological_activity', 'cholesterol_accumulation', 'this_incidental_biological_activity', 'SERMs', 'a_plausible_mechanism', 'their_inhibitory_effects', 'Ebola_infection']"

"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is thought to be a common cause of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in children. The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae RTIs currently relies on serological methods and/or the detection of bacterial DNA in the upper respiratory tract (URT). It is conceivable, however, that these diagnostic methods also yield positive results if M. pneumoniae is carried asymptomatically in the URT. Positive results from these tests may therefore not always be indicative of a symptomatic infection. The existence of asymptomatic carriage of M. pneumoniae has not been established. We hypothesized that asymptomatic carriage in children exists and investigated whether colonization and symptomatic infection could be differentiated by current diagnostic methods. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was conducted at the Erasmus MC–Sophia Children's Hospital and the after-hours General Practitioners Cooperative in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Asymptomatic children (n = 405) and children with RTI symptoms (n = 321) aged 3 mo to 16 y were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from July 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011. Clinical data, pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal specimens, and serum samples were collected. The primary objective was to differentiate between colonization and symptomatic infection with M. pneumoniae by current diagnostic methods, especially real-time PCR. M. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 21.2% (95% CI 17.2%–25.2%) of the asymptomatic children and in 16.2% (95% CI 12.2%–20.2%) of the symptomatic children (p = 0.11). Neither serology nor quantitative PCR nor culture differentiated asymptomatic carriage from infection. A total of 202 children were tested for the presence of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Two or more pathogens were found in 56% (63/112) of the asymptomatic children and in 55.5% (50/90) of the symptomatic children. Finally, longitudinal sampling showed persistence of M. pneumoniae in the URT for up to 4 mo. Fifteen of the 21 asymptomatic children with M. pneumoniae and 19 of the 22 symptomatic children with M. pneumoniae in this longitudinal follow-up tested negative after 1 mo. CONCLUSIONS: Although our study has limitations, such as a single study site and limited sample size, our data indicate that the presence of M. pneumoniae in the URT is common in asymptomatic children. The current diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae are unable to differentiate between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic infection.

"BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infections can cause a number of diseases ranging from simple cold sores to dangerous keratitis and lethal encephalitis. The interaction between virus and host cells, critical for viral replication, is being extensively investigated by many laboratories. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1. The mechanisms of induction are mediated, at least in part, by signaling pathways such as NFκB and CREB. METHODS: SIRC, VERO, and 293HEK cell lines were infected with HSV-1, and the Egr-1 transcript and protein were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The localization and expression profile of Egr-1 were investigated further by immunofluorescence microscopy analyses. The recruitment of transcription factors to the Egr-1 promoter during infection was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Various inhibitors and dominant-negative mutant were used to assess the mechanisms of Egr-1 induction and their effects were addressed by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Western blot analyses showed that Egr-1 was absent in uninfected cells; however, the protein was detected 24-72 hours post treatment, and the response was directly proportional to the titer of the virus used for infection. Using recombinant HSV-1 expressing EGFP, Egr-1 was detected only in the infected cells. ChIP assays demonstrated that NFкB and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) were recruited to the Egr-1 promoter upon infection. Additional studies showed that inhibitors of NFкB and dominant-negative CREB repressed the Egr-1 induction by HSV-1 infection. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that Egr-1 is expressed rapidly upon HSV-1 infection and that this novel induction could be due to the NFкB/CREB-mediated transactivation. Egr-1 induction might play a key role in the viral gene expression, replication, inflammation, and the disease progression.","In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1.","['In', 'this_study', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'HSV-1_lytic_infection', 'triggers', 'the_expression', 'of', 'important_multi-functional_transcription_factor_Egr1', '.']","In this_study , we tested the_hypothesis that HSV-1_lytic_infection triggers the_expression of important_multi-functional_transcription_factor_Egr1 .","['this_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'HSV-1_lytic_infection', 'the_expression', 'important_multi-functional_transcription_factor_Egr1']"
"During the hunting season in March 2012, a total of 93 blood samples were collected from wild boars (Sus scrofa) shot in the area of northern Turkey (Samsun and Gumushane provinces). These blood samples were examined by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) for the presence of antibodies to classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Aujeszky’s disease virus (ADV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine parvovirus (PPV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine rotavirus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). Out of 93 serum samples examined, 65 (69.9 %) were positive for PRV, 22 (23.7 %) were positive for ADV, 5 (5.4 %) were positive for BVDV, 4 (4.3 %) were positive for PPV and 2 (2.2 %) were positive for PRRSV. All sera were negative for ASFV, SVDV, HEV, SIV, PRCV, TGEV and CSFV. The results, recorded for the first time in Turkey, supported the hypothesis that wild boar act as a potential reservoir of selected viruses and thus have a role in the epidemiology of these diseases.","The results, recorded for the first time in Turkey, supported the hypothesis that wild boar act as a potential reservoir of selected viruses and thus have a role in the epidemiology of these diseases.","['The_results', ',', 'recorded', 'for', 'the_first_time', 'in', 'Turkey', ',', 'supported', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'wild', 'boar', 'act', 'as', 'a_potential_reservoir', 'of', 'selected_viruses', 'and', 'thus', 'have', 'a_role', 'in', 'the_epidemiology', 'of', 'these_diseases', '.']","The_results , recorded for the_first_time in Turkey , supported the_hypothesis that wild boar act as a_potential_reservoir of selected_viruses and thus have a_role in the_epidemiology of these_diseases .","['The_results', 'the_first_time', 'Turkey', 'the_hypothesis', 'boar', 'act', 'a_potential_reservoir', 'selected_viruses', 'a_role', 'the_epidemiology', 'these_diseases']"
"Phylogenetic analysis of complete genomes of the avian coronaviruses avian infectious bronchitis (AIBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) supported the hypothesis that numerous recombination events have occurred between these viruses. Although the two groups of viruses differed markedly in the sequence of the spike protein, the gene (S) encoding this protein showed no evidence of positive selection or of an elevated mutation rate. Rather, the data suggested that recombination events have homogenized the portions of the genome other than the S gene between the two groups of viruses, while continuing to maintain the two distinct, anciently diverged versions of the S gene. The latter hypothesis was supported by a phylogeny of S proteins from representative coronaviruses, in which S proteins of AIBV and TCoV fell in the same clade.

"Recent outbreaks of novel infectious diseases (e.g. SARS, influenza H1N1) have highlighted the threat of cross-species pathogen transmission. When first introduced to a population, a pathogen is often poorly adapted to its new host and must evolve in order to escape extinction. Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the ‘riskiest’ contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect. In most situations, increasing overall mutation probability increases the risk of emergence; however, notable exceptions arise when deleterious mutations are available.",These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors.,"['These_generalizations', 'lead', 'to', 'novel_predictions', 'regarding', 'the_impact', 'of', 'hypothesized_risk_factors', '.']",These_generalizations lead to novel_predictions regarding the_impact of hypothesized_risk_factors .,"['These_generalizations', 'novel_predictions', 'the_impact', 'hypothesized_risk_factors']"
"Viruses are one of the major causes of acute and chronic infectious diseases and thus a major contributor to the global burden of disease. Several studies have shown how viruses have evolved to hijack basic cellular pathways and evade innate immune response by modulating key host factors and signaling pathways. A collective view of these multiple studies could advance our understanding of virus-host interactions and provide new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of viral diseases. Here, we performed an integrative meta-analysis to elucidate the 17 different host-virus interactomes. Network and bioinformatics analyses showed how viruses with small genomes efficiently achieve the maximal effect by targeting multifunctional and highly connected host proteins with a high occurrence of disordered regions. We also identified the core cellular process subnetworks that are targeted by all the viruses. Integration with functional RNA interference (RNAi) datasets showed that a large proportion of the targets are required for viral replication. Furthermore, we performed an interactome-informed drug re-purposing screen and identified novel activities for broad-spectrum antiviral agents against hepatitis C virus and human metapneumovirus. Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.","Altogether, these orthogonal datasets could serve as a platform for hypothesis generation and follow-up studies to broaden our understanding of the viral evasion landscape.","['Altogether', ',', 'these_orthogonal_datasets', 'could', 'serve', 'as', 'a_platform', 'for', 'hypothesis_generation', 'and', 'follow-up_studies', 'to', 'broaden', 'our_understanding', 'of', 'the_viral_evasion_landscape', '.']","Altogether , these_orthogonal_datasets could serve as a_platform for hypothesis_generation and follow-up_studies to broaden our_understanding of the_viral_evasion_landscape .","['these_orthogonal_datasets', 'a_platform', 'hypothesis_generation', 'follow-up_studies', 'our_understanding', 'the_viral_evasion_landscape']"
"Daily oscillations of pulmonary function depend on the rhythmic activity of the circadian timing system. Environmental tobacco/cigarette smoke (CS) disrupts circadian clock leading to enhanced inflammatory responses. Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) increases hospitalization rates and death in susceptible individuals, including patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We hypothesized that molecular clock disruption is enhanced by IAV infection, altering cellular and lung function, leading to severity in airway disease phenotypes. C57BL/6J mice exposed to chronic CS, BMAL1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were infected with IAV. Following infection, we measured diurnal rhythms of clock gene expression in the lung, locomotor activity, pulmonary function, inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and emphysematous responses. Chronic CS exposure combined with IAV infection altered the timing of clock gene expression and reduced locomotor activity in parallel with increased lung inflammation, disrupted rhythms of pulmonary function, and emphysema. BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV showed pronounced detriments in behavior and survival, and increased lung inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses. This suggests that remodeling of lung clock function following IAV infection alters clock-dependent gene expression and normal rhythms of lung function, enhanced emphysematous and injurious responses. This may have implications for the pathobiology of respiratory virus-induced airway disease severity and exacerbations.","We hypothesized that molecular clock disruption is enhanced by IAV infection, altering cellular and lung function, leading to severity in airway disease phenotypes.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'molecular_clock_disruption', 'is', 'enhanced', 'by', 'IAV_infection', ',', 'altering', 'cellular_and_lung_function', ',', 'leading', 'to', 'severity', 'in', 'airway_disease_phenotypes', '.']","We hypothesized that molecular_clock_disruption is enhanced by IAV_infection , altering cellular_and_lung_function , leading to severity in airway_disease_phenotypes .","['molecular_clock_disruption', 'IAV_infection', 'cellular_and_lung_function', 'severity', 'airway_disease_phenotypes']"
"The nucleoprotein-encoding gene (N) of murine hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV 3), from the Mill Hill strain, was cloned and sequenced. It was compared to gene N from other murine coronaviruses and was found to share more similarities with N sequences from MHV 1 and MHV JHM strains than with the published MHV 3 N sequence which is almost identical to MHV A59.

"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease characterized by intrahepatic bile duct destruction and the production of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA). The absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease. Previous work has suggested that SJL/J mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC, leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis. We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-γ injections. Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, α-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-γ. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-γ, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with α-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with α-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis. Thus, autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific.",We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-γ injections.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'this_pathology', 'would', 'be', 'augmented', 'if', 'immunization', 'occurred', 'in', 'the_presence', 'of', 'IFN-γ_injections', '.']",We hypothesized that this_pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the_presence of IFN-γ_injections .,"['this_pathology', 'immunization', 'the_presence', 'IFN-γ_injections']"
"The S2 gene of several strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to the Arkansas, Connecticut, and Florida serotypes was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S2 gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data resulted in groups of strains that were the same as groupings observed when S1 sequence data was used. Thus, it appears that S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes. Although the sequence differences were small, we found that only a few amino acid differences were responsible for different secondary structure predictions for the S2 subunit. It is likely that these changes create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which could affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype specific epitopes are located. Based on this sequence data, we hypothesize that the S2 subunit can affect specific antibody binding to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein.","Based on this sequence data, we hypothesize that the S2 subunit can affect specific antibody binding to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein.","['Based', 'on', 'this_sequence_data', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_S2_subunit', 'can', 'affect', 'specific_antibody', 'binding', 'to', 'the_S1_subunit', 'of', 'the_IBV_spike_glycoprotein', '.']","Based on this_sequence_data , we hypothesize that the_S2_subunit can affect specific_antibody binding to the_S1_subunit of the_IBV_spike_glycoprotein .","['this_sequence_data', 'the_S2_subunit', 'specific_antibody', 'the_S1_subunit']"
"Peroxisomes are components of virtually all eukaryotic cells. While much is known about peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) are targeted and inserted into the peroxisome membrane is extremely limited. Here, we show that PEX19 binds a broad spectrum of PMPs, displays saturable PMP binding, and interacts with regions of PMPs required for their targeting to peroxisomes. Furthermore, mislocalization of PEX19 to the nucleus leads to nuclear accumulation of newly synthesized PMPs. At steady state, PEX19 is bimodally distributed between the cytoplasm and peroxisome, with most of the protein in the cytoplasm. We propose that PEX19 may bind newly synthesized PMPs and facilitate their insertion into the peroxisome membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.",This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the mitochondrion.,"['This_hypothesis', 'is', 'supported', 'by', 'the_observation', 'that', 'the_loss', 'of', 'PEX19', 'results', 'in', 'degradation', 'of', 'PMPs', 'and/or', 'mislocalization', 'of', 'PMPs', 'to', 'the_mitochondrion', '.']",This_hypothesis is supported by the_observation that the_loss of PEX19 results in degradation of PMPs and/or mislocalization of PMPs to the_mitochondrion .,"['This_hypothesis', 'the_observation', 'the_loss', 'PEX19', 'degradation', 'PMPs', 'mislocalization', 'PMPs', 'the_mitochondrion']"
"No therapeutics or vaccines currently exist for human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002–2003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN+) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN−) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN− CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN− population as compared to ExoN+. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.",All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function.,"['All_genetic_and_biochemical_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'nsp14-ExoN', 'has', 'an_RNA_proofreading_function', '.']",All_genetic_and_biochemical_data support the_hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an_RNA_proofreading_function .,"['All_genetic_and_biochemical_data support', 'the_hypothesis', 'nsp14-ExoN']"
"Sarcocystis neurona is the main agent associated with equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM).

"The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a mouse genetic reference population whose range of applications includes quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The design of a CC QTL mapping study involves multiple decisions, including which and how many strains to use, and how many replicates per strain to phenotype, all viewed within the context of hypothesized QTL architecture. Until now, these decisions have been informed largely by early power analyses that were based on simulated, hypothetical CC genomes. Now that more than 50 CC strains are available and more than 70 CC genomes have been observed, it is possible to characterize power based on realized CC genomes. We report power analyses from extensive simulations and examine several key considerations: 1) the number of strains and biological replicates, 2) the QTL effect size, 3) the presence of population structure, and 4) the distribution of functionally distinct alleles among the founder strains at the QTL.

Identification of exact amino acid residues that are crucial for the interaction of S1 with ACE2 could provide working hypotheses for experimental studies and might be helpful for the development of antiviral inhibitor. In this paper, a molecular docking model of SARS-CoV S1 protein in complex with human ACE2 was constructed. The interacting residue pairs within this complex model and their contact types were also identified. Our model, supported by significant biochemical evidence, suggested receptor-binding residues were concentrated in two segments of S1 protein. In contrast, the interfacial residues in ACE2, though close to each other in tertiary structure, were found to be widely scattered in the primary sequence.

"Abstract The 3C-like main peptidase 3CLpro is a viral polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the viability of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). While it is generalized that 3CLpro and the structurally related 3Cpro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (CLSPs), some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized. Here, we present three crystal structures of SARS 3CLpro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide-based phthalhydrazide inhibitors. Both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of Cys145, trapping the enzyme's catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates. Most significantly, our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule, possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr26, has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme-bound inhibitor. Our data suggest that this structure resembles that of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptidyl cleavage.","While it is generalized that 3CLpro and the structurally related 3Cpro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (CLSPs), some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized.","['While', 'it', 'is', 'generalized', 'that', '3CLpro', 'and', 'the_structurally_related_3Cpro_viral_peptidases', 'cleave', 'their_substrates', 'via', 'a_mechanism', 'similar', 'to', 'that', 'underlying', 'the_peptide_hydrolysis', 'by', 'chymotrypsin-like_serine_proteinases', '(', 'CLSPs', ')', ',', 'some', 'of', 'the_hypothesized_key_intermediates', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'structurally', 'characterized', '.']","While it is generalized that 3CLpro and the_structurally_related_3Cpro_viral_peptidases cleave their_substrates via a_mechanism similar to that underlying the_peptide_hydrolysis by chymotrypsin-like_serine_proteinases ( CLSPs ) , some of the_hypothesized_key_intermediates have not been structurally characterized .","['3CLpro and the_structurally_related_3Cpro_viral_peptidases cleave their_substrates', 'a_mechanism', 'that underlying the_peptide_hydrolysis', 'chymotrypsin-like_serine_proteinases', 'CLSPs', 'the_hypothesized_key_intermediates']"
"Objective To investigate the risk factors of empyema after acute viral infection and to clarify the hypothesized association(s) between empyema and some viruses and/or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Study design A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. Results Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. Conclusions NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children.",Objective To investigate the risk factors of empyema after acute viral infection and to clarify the hypothesized association(s) between empyema and some viruses and/or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).,"['Objective', 'To', 'investigate', 'the_risk_factors', 'of', 'empyema', 'after', 'acute_viral_infection', 'and', 'to', 'clarify', 'the', 'hypothesized', 'association(s', ')', 'between', 'empyema', 'and', 'some_viruses', 'and/or', 'the_use', 'of', 'nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs', '(', 'NSAIDs', ')', '.']",Objective To investigate the_risk_factors of empyema after acute_viral_infection and to clarify the hypothesized association(s ) between empyema and some_viruses and/or the_use of nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs ( NSAIDs ) .,"['the_risk_factors', 'empyema', 'association(s', 'empyema', 'some_viruses', 'the_use', 'nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs', '( NSAIDs']"
"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) during infancy has been consistently associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. In addition, evidence supports that this relationship is causal. However, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. The INSPIRE (Infant Susceptibility to Pulmonary Infections and Asthma Following RSV Exposure) study objectives are to: 1) characterize the host phenotypic response to RSV infection in infancy and the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma, 2) identify the immune response and lung injury patterns of RSV infection that are associated with the development of early childhood wheezing illness and asthma, and 3) determine the contribution of specific RSV strains to early childhood wheezing and asthma development. This article describes the INSPIRE study, including study aims, design, recruitment results, and enrolled population characteristics. METHODS/DESIGN: The cohort is a population based longitudinal birth cohort of term healthy infants enrolled during the first months of life over a two year period. Respiratory infection surveillance was conducted from November to March of the first year of life, through surveys administered every two weeks. In-person illness visits were conducted if infants met pre-specified criteria for a respiratory illness visit. Infants will be followed annually to ages 3-4 years for assessment of the primary endpoint: wheezing illness. Nasal, urine, stool and blood samples were collected at various time points throughout the study for measurements of host and viral factors that predict wheezing illness. Nested case-control studies will additionally be used to address other primary and secondary hypotheses. DISCUSSION: In the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years and follow-up will continue through 2016. The mean age of enrollment was 60 days.

"Local epidemic curves during the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic were often characterized by multiple epidemic waves. Identifying the underlying cause(s) of such waves may help manage future pandemics. We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’. We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing that occurred during the course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38%, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R(0), was estimated to be in the range of 1.6–2.0 with a preferred estimate of 1.8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90%) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9%. The observed clinical attack rate of 36.6% was substantially lower than the 59% expected based on the estimated value of R(0), implying that approximately 22% of the population were spared from clinical infection. This reduction in the clinical attack rate translates to an estimated 260 per 100 000 lives having been saved, and suggests that social distancing interventions could play a major role in mitigating the public health impact of future influenza pandemics.",We investigate the hypothesis that these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’.,"['We', 'investigate', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'these_waves', 'were', 'caused', 'by', 'people', 'avoiding', 'potentially_infectious_contacts', '—', 'a_behaviour', 'termed', '‘', 'social', 'distancing', '’', '.']",We investigate the_hypothesis that these_waves were caused by people avoiding potentially_infectious_contacts — a_behaviour termed ‘ social distancing ’ .,"['the_hypothesis', 'these_waves', 'people', 'potentially_infectious_contacts', 'a_behaviour', '‘ social distancing']"
"BACKGROUND: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection in Norwegian pigs was largely subclinical. This study tested the hypothesis that the infection causes negligible impact on pigs’ growth performance in terms of feed conversion efficiency, daily feed intake, daily growth, age on reaching 100 kg bodyweight and overall feed intake. A sample of 1955 pigs originating from 43 breeding herds was classified into five infection status groups; seronegative pigs (n = 887); seropositive pigs (n = 874); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 33 kg and 60 kg (n = 123); pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 61 kg and 80 kg (n = 34) and pigs positive for virus at bodyweight between 81 kg and 100 kg (n = 37). Each pig had daily recordings of feed intake and bodyweight from 33 kg to 100 kg. Marginal effects of the virus infection on the outcomes were estimated by multi-level linear regression, which accounted for known fixed effects (breed, birthdate, average daily feed intake and growth phase) and random effects (cluster effects of pig and herd). RESULTS: The seropositive and virus positive pigs had decreased (P value<0.05) growth performance compared to seronegative pigs even though feed intake was not decreased. Reduced feed conversion efficiency led to lower average daily growth, additional feed requirement and longer time needed to reach the 100 kg bodyweight. The effects were more marked (P value<0.03) in pigs infected at a younger age and lasted a longer period. Despite increased feed intake observed, their growth rates were lower and they took more time to reach 100 kg bodyweight compared to the seronegative pigs. CONCLUSION: Our study rejected the null hypothesis that the virus infection had negligible adverse effects on growth performance of Norwegian pigs.","This study tested the hypothesis that the infection causes negligible impact on pigs’ growth performance in terms of feed conversion efficiency, daily feed intake, daily growth, age on reaching 100 kg bodyweight and overall feed intake.","['This_study', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_infection', 'causes', 'negligible_impact', 'on', 'pigs’_growth_performance', 'in', 'terms', 'of', 'feed_conversion_efficiency', ',', 'daily_feed_intake', ',', 'daily_growth', ',', 'age', 'on', 'reaching', '100_kg_bodyweight', 'and', 'overall_feed_intake', '.']","This_study tested the_hypothesis that the_infection causes negligible_impact on pigs’_growth_performance in terms of feed_conversion_efficiency , daily_feed_intake , daily_growth , age on reaching 100_kg_bodyweight and overall_feed_intake .","['This_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_infection', 'negligible_impact', 'pigs’_growth_performance', 'terms', 'feed_conversion_efficiency , daily_feed_intake , daily_growth', 'age']"
"We evaluated the presence of coronaviruses by PCR in 918 Australian wild bird samples collected during 2016–17. Coronaviruses were detected in 141 samples (15.3%) from species of ducks, shorebirds and herons and from multiple sampling locations. Sequencing of selected positive samples found mainly gammacoronaviruses, but also some deltacoronaviruses. The detection rate of coronaviruses was improved by using multiple PCR assays, as no single assay could detect all coronavirus positive samples. Sequencing of the relatively conserved Orf1 PCR amplicons found that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses were similar to duck gammacoronaviruses around the world. Some sequenced shorebird gammacoronaviruses belonged to Charadriiformes lineages, but others were more closely related to duck gammacoronaviruses. Australian duck and heron deltacoronaviruses belonged to lineages with other duck and heron deltacoronaviruses, but were almost 20% different in nucleotide sequence to other deltacoronavirus sequences available. Deltacoronavirus sequences from shorebirds formed a lineage with a deltacoronavirus from a ruddy turnstone detected in the United States. Given that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other regions, and Australian ducks rarely come into contact with migratory Palearctic duck species, we hypothesise that migratory shorebirds are the important vector for moving wild bird coronaviruses into and out of Australia.","Given that Australian duck gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other regions, and Australian ducks rarely come into contact with migratory Palearctic duck species, we hypothesise that migratory shorebirds are the important vector for moving wild bird coronaviruses into and out of Australia.","['Given', 'that', 'Australian_duck_gammacoronaviruses', 'are', 'highly', 'similar', 'to', 'those', 'found', 'in', 'other_regions', ',', 'and', 'Australian_ducks', 'rarely', 'come', 'into', 'contact', 'with', 'migratory_Palearctic_duck_species', ',', 'we', 'hypothesise', 'that', 'migratory_shorebirds', 'are', 'the_important_vector', 'for', 'moving', 'wild_bird_coronaviruses', 'into', 'and', 'out', 'of', 'Australia', '.']","Given that Australian_duck_gammacoronaviruses are highly similar to those found in other_regions , and Australian_ducks rarely come into contact with migratory_Palearctic_duck_species , we hypothesise that migratory_shorebirds are the_important_vector for moving wild_bird_coronaviruses into and out of Australia .","['Australian_duck_gammacoronaviruses', 'other_regions', 'Australian_ducks', 'contact', 'migratory_Palearctic_duck_species', 'migratory_shorebirds', 'the_important_vector', 'wild_bird_coronaviruses', 'Australia']"
"Abstract The presence of immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients supports the hypothesis of an infectious etiology, although the antigenic targets remain elusive. Neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice provides a useful tool for studying mechanisms of demyelination in a virus-induced experimental model of MS. This study uses Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare differential spinal cord mRNA levels between mice infected with demyelinating and non-demyelinating strains of MHV to identify host immune genes expressed in this demyelinating disease model. The study reveals that during the acute stage of infection, both strains induce inflammatory innate immune response genes, whereas upregulation of several immunoglobulin genes during chronic stage infection is unique to infection with the demyelinating strain. Results suggest that the demyelinating strain induced an innate-immune response during acute infection that may promote switching of Ig isotype genes during chronic infection, potentially playing a role in antibody-mediated progressive demyelination even after viral clearance.","The presence of immunoglobulin oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients supports the hypothesis of an infectious etiology, although the antigenic targets remain elusive.","['The_presence', 'of', 'immunoglobulin_oligoclonal_bands', 'in', 'the_cerebrospinal_fluid', 'of', 'Multiple_Sclerosis_(MS)_patients', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'an_infectious_etiology', ',', 'although', 'the_antigenic_targets', 'remain', 'elusive', '.']","The_presence of immunoglobulin_oligoclonal_bands in the_cerebrospinal_fluid of Multiple_Sclerosis_(MS)_patients supports the_hypothesis of an_infectious_etiology , although the_antigenic_targets remain elusive .","['The_presence', 'immunoglobulin_oligoclonal_bands', 'the_cerebrospinal_fluid', 'Multiple_Sclerosis_(MS)_patients', 'the_hypothesis', 'an_infectious_etiology', 'the_antigenic_targets']"
"Nidoviruses with large genomes (26.3–31.7 kb; ‘large nidoviruses’), including Coronaviridae and Roniviridae, are the most complex positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses. Based on genome size, they are far separated from all other ssRNA+ viruses (below 19.6 kb), including the distantly related Arteriviridae (12.7–15.7 kb; ‘small nidoviruses’). Exceptionally for ssRNA+ viruses, large nidoviruses encode a 3′-5′exoribonuclease (ExoN) that was implicated in controlling RNA replication fidelity. Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus. This Nam Dinh virus (NDiV), named after a Vietnamese province, was isolated from mosquitoes and is yet to be linked to any pathology. The genome of this enveloped 60–80 nm virus is 20,192 nt and has a nidovirus-like polycistronic organization including two large, partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1b followed by several smaller 3′-proximal ORFs. Peptide sequencing assigned three virion proteins to ORFs 2a, 2b, and 3, which are expressed from two 3′-coterminal subgenomic RNAs. The NDiV ORF1a/ORF1b frameshifting signal and various replicative proteins were tentatively mapped to canonical positions in the nidovirus genome. They include six nidovirus-wide conserved replicase domains, as well as the ExoN and 2′-O-methyltransferase that are specific to large nidoviruses. NDiV ORF1b also encodes a putative N7-methyltransferase, identified in a subset of large nidoviruses, but not the uridylate-specific endonuclease that – in deviation from the current paradigm - is present exclusively in the currently known vertebrate nidoviruses. Rooted phylogenetic inference by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods indicates that NDiV clusters with roniviruses and that its branch diverged from large nidoviruses early after they split from small nidoviruses. Together these characteristics identify NDiV as the prototype of a new nidovirus family and a missing link in the transition from small to large nidoviruses.","Its acquisition may have given rise to the ancestor of large nidoviruses, a hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary support using comparative genomics involving the newly discovered first insect-borne nidovirus.","['Its_acquisition', 'may', 'have', 'given', 'rise', 'to', 'the_ancestor', 'of', 'large_nidoviruses', ',', 'a_hypothesis', 'for', 'which', 'we', 'here', 'provide', 'evolutionary_support', 'using', 'comparative_genomics', 'involving', 'the_newly_discovered_first_insect-borne_nidovirus', '.']","Its_acquisition may have given rise to the_ancestor of large_nidoviruses , a_hypothesis for which we here provide evolutionary_support using comparative_genomics involving the_newly_discovered_first_insect-borne_nidovirus .","['Its_acquisition', 'rise', 'the_ancestor', 'large_nidoviruses', 'a_hypothesis', 'evolutionary_support', 'comparative_genomics', 'the_newly_discovered_first_insect-borne_nidovirus']"
"Abstract Objective Adult attachment insecurity is associated with many health outcomes and may be associated with sleep disturbance. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep disturbance mediates the relationship between attachment insecurity and three measures of health (perceived general health, physical symptoms and sick days) in a group that is at high risk of sleep disturbance: hospital based health-care workers. Methods One hundred thirty-one nondepressed female hospital workers completed self-report measures of adult attachment, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms (excluding sleep-related items) and health outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation was tested with sequential regression analyses. Results Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality (ρ=.20 and .19, respectively, P<.05) and physical symptoms (ρ=.21 and .19, P<.05). Attachment anxiety was also associated with depressive symptoms (ρ=.33, P<.001) and sick days (ρ=.21, P<.05). For both physical symptoms and sick days, mediation analyses were consistent with global sleep quality acting as a partial mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and physical health. Non-sleep-related depressive symptoms were a stronger mediator. Conclusions This study corroborates evidence that attachment insecurity is associated with sleep disturbance and extends this association to the occurrence of physical symptoms and time off work due to sickness among workers in a high-stress occupation.",The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sleep,"['The_purpose', 'of', 'this_study', 'was', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'sleep']",The_purpose of this_study was to test the_hypothesis that sleep,"['The_purpose', 'this_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'sleep']"
"Proteases are candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets for many diseases. Sensitive and robust techniques are needed to quantify proteolytic activities within the complex biological milieu. We hypothesized that a combinatorial protease substrate library could be used effectively to identify similarities and differences between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), two body fluids that are clinically important for developing targeted therapies and diagnostics. We used a concise library of fluorogenic probes to map the protease substrate specificities of serum and BALF from guinea pigs. Differences in the proteolytic fingerprints of the two fluids were striking: serum proteases cleaved substrates containing cationic residues and proline, whereas BALF proteases cleaved substrates containing aliphatic and aromatic residues. Notably, cleavage of proline-containing substrates dominated all other protease activities in both human and guinea pig serum. This substrate profiling approach provides a foundation for quantitative comparisons of protease specificities between complex biological samples.","We hypothesized that a combinatorial protease substrate library could be used effectively to identify similarities and differences between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), two body fluids that are clinically important for developing targeted therapies and diagnostics.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'a_combinatorial_protease_substrate_library', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'effectively', 'to', 'identify', 'similarities', 'and', 'differences', 'between', 'serum', 'and', 'bronchoalveolar', 'lavage_fluid', '(', 'BALF', ')', ',', 'two', 'body', 'fluids', 'that', 'are', 'clinically', 'important', 'for', 'developing', 'targeted_therapies', 'and', 'diagnostics', '.']","We hypothesized that a_combinatorial_protease_substrate_library could be used effectively to identify similarities and differences between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage_fluid ( BALF ) , two body fluids that are clinically important for developing targeted_therapies and diagnostics .","['a_combinatorial_protease_substrate_library', 'similarities', 'differences', 'serum', 'bronchoalveolar lavage_fluid', 'BALF', 'body', 'fluids', 'targeted_therapies', 'diagnostics']"
"BACKGROUND: Our previous studies revealed that a new disease form of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is associated with specific Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) strains. To achieve a better understanding of the pathogenicity and evolution of SS2 at the whole-genome level, comparative genomic analysis of 18 SS2 strains, selected on the basis of virulence and geographic origin, was performed using NimbleGen tiling arrays. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that SS2 isolates have highly divergent genomes. The 89K pathogenicity island (PAI), which has been previously recognized as unique to the Chinese epidemic strains causing STSS, was partially included in some other virulent and avirulent strains. The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS. Moreover, we identified many polymorphisms in genes encoding candidate or known virulence factors, such as PlcR, lipase, sortases, the pilus-associated proteins, and the response regulator RevS and CtsR. On the basis of analysis of regions of differences (RDs) across the entire genome for the 18 selected SS2 strains, a model of microevolution for these strains is proposed, which provides clues into Streptococcus pathogenicity and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our deep comparative genomic analysis of the 89K PAI present in the genome of SS2 strains revealed details into how some virulent strains acquired genes that may contribute to STSS, which may lead to better environmental monitoring of epidemic SS2 strains.","The ABC-type transport systems, encoded by 89K, were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the catastrophic features of STSS.","['The_ABC-type_transport_systems', ',', 'encoded', 'by', '89K', ',', 'were', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'greatly', 'contribute', 'to', 'the_catastrophic_features', 'of', 'STSS', '.']","The_ABC-type_transport_systems , encoded by 89K , were hypothesized to greatly contribute to the_catastrophic_features of STSS .","['The_ABC-type_transport_systems', '89K', 'the_catastrophic_features', 'STSS']"
"Abstract Most paramyxoviruses enter the cell by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 °C was similar to that at 37 °C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine. These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.",These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.,"['These_results', 'support', 'our_hypothesis', 'that_entry', 'of', 'NDV', 'into', 'ELL-0_and_HeLa_cells', 'occurs', 'through', 'the_plasma_membrane', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'by', 'dynamin-', 'low', 'pH-', 'and', 'receptor-', 'dependent_endocytosis', '.']",These_results support our_hypothesis that_entry of NDV into ELL-0_and_HeLa_cells occurs through the_plasma_membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent_endocytosis .,"['These_results', 'our_hypothesis that_entry', 'NDV', 'ELL-0_and_HeLa_cells', 'dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent_endocytosis']"
"It is widely recognized that cats appear to be less frequently affected by arthropod-borne infectious diseases than dogs and share fewer zoonotic pathogens with man. This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections. This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.","This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit.","['This_review', 'explores', 'the_possible_reasons', 'for', 'the_difference', 'between', 'the_two_most_common_small_companion_animal_species', ',', 'including', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'cats', 'might', 'have', 'a_genetically-determined_immunological_resistance', 'to', 'arthropod_vectors', 'or', 'the_microparasites', 'they', 'transmit', '.']","This_review explores the_possible_reasons for the_difference between the_two_most_common_small_companion_animal_species , including the_hypothesis that cats might have a_genetically-determined_immunological_resistance to arthropod_vectors or the_microparasites they transmit .","['the_possible_reasons', 'the_two_most_common_small_companion_animal_species', 'the_hypothesis', 'cats', 'a_genetically-determined_immunological_resistance', 'arthropod_vectors', 'the_microparasites']"
"Astroviruses (AstV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, best known for causing diarrhea in humans and are also found in many other mammals; in those, the relevance in gastroenteritis remains unclear. Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species’ fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide- and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants’ feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission. The findings point out the occurrence and fecal shedding of previously unknown AstV in sheep and goats and pave the way towards a better understanding of the diversity and transmission of AstV in small ruminants.",The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission.,"['The_high_genetic_similarity', 'between', 'the_ovine', 'and', 'one', 'of', 'the_bovine_AstV', 'strengthens', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'an_interspecies_transmission', '.']",The_high_genetic_similarity between the_ovine and one of the_bovine_AstV strengthens the_hypothesis of an_interspecies_transmission .,"['the_ovine', 'the_bovine_AstV', 'the_hypothesis', 'an_interspecies_transmission']"
"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease with no clinically effective treatment. This field study evaluated treatment with Polyprenyl Immunostimulant (PI) in cats with the non-effusive form of FIP. Because immune suppression is a major component in the pathology of FIP, we hypothesized that treatment with an immune system stimulant would increase survival times of cats with dry FIP. Sixty cats, diagnosed with dry FIP by primary care and specialist veterinarians and meeting the acceptance criteria, were treated with PI without intentional selection of less severe cases. The survival time from the start of PI treatment in cats diagnosed with dry FIP showed that of the 60 cats with dry FIP treated with PI, 8 survived over 200 days, and 4 of 60 survived over 300 days. A literature search identified 59 cats with non-effusive or dry FIP; no cat with only dry FIP lived longer than 200 days. Veterinarians of cats treated with PI that survived over 30 days reported improvements in clinical signs and behavior. The survival times in our study were significantly longer in cats who were not treated with corticosteroids concurrently with PI. While not a cure, PI shows promise in the treatment of dry form FIP, but a controlled study will be needed to verify the benefit.","Because immune suppression is a major component in the pathology of FIP, we hypothesized that treatment with an immune system stimulant would increase survival times of cats with dry FIP.","['Because', 'immune_suppression', 'is', 'a_major_component', 'in', 'the_pathology', 'of', 'FIP', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that_treatment', 'with', 'an_immune_system_stimulant', 'would', 'increase', 'survival_times', 'of', 'cats', 'with', 'dry_FIP', '.']","Because immune_suppression is a_major_component in the_pathology of FIP , we hypothesized that_treatment with an_immune_system_stimulant would increase survival_times of cats with dry_FIP .","['the_pathology', 'FIP', 'that_treatment', 'an_immune_system_stimulant', 'survival_times', 'cats', 'dry_FIP']"
"OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of spatial proximity, defined as patients sharing bays, in the spread of norovirus during outbreaks in hospitals. DESIGN: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011. METHODS: Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of two million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting. This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk. RESULTS: 65 outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the serial interval to be 1.86 days (95% CI 1.6 to 2.2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was not significant (p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward.","We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk.","['We', 'then', 'used', 'a_permutation_test', 'to', 'assess', 'whether_proximity', ',', 'for', 'all_outbreaks', ',', 'was', 'more', 'extreme', 'than', 'would', 'be', 'expected', 'by', 'chance', 'under', 'the_null_hypothesis', 'that', 'proximity', 'was', 'not', 'associated', 'with', 'transmission_risk', '.']","We then used a_permutation_test to assess whether_proximity , for all_outbreaks , was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the_null_hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission_risk .","['a_permutation_test', 'all_outbreaks', 'chance', 'proximity', 'transmission_risk']"
"Rotaviruses (RVs) are important enteric pathogens of newborn humans and animals, causing diarrhea and in rare cases death, especially in very young individuals. Rotavirus vaccines presently used are modified live vaccines that lack complete biological safety. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that vaccines based on in situ produced, non-infectious rotavirus-like particles (RVLPs) are efficient while being entirely safe. However, using either vaccine, active mucosal immunization cannot induce protective immunity in newborns due to their immature immune system. We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk. Using a codon optimized polycistronic gene expression cassette packaged into herpesvirus particles, the simultaneous expression of the RV capsid genes led to the intracellular formation of RVLPs in various cell lines. Vaccinated dams developed a strong RV specific IgG antibody response determined in sera and milk of both mother and pups. Moreover, sera of naïve pups nursed by vaccinated dams also had RV specific antibodies suggesting a lactogenic transfer of antibodies. Although full protection of pups was not achieved in this mouse model, our observations are important for the development of improved vaccines against RV in humans as well as in various animal species.",We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk.,"['We', 'therefore', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'offspring', 'from', 'vaccinated_dams', 'are', 'passively', 'immunized', 'either', 'by', 'transfer', 'of', 'maternal_antibodies', 'during', 'pregnancy', 'or', 'by', 'taking', 'up', 'antibodies', 'from', 'milk', '.']",We therefore hypothesized that offspring from vaccinated_dams are passively immunized either by transfer of maternal_antibodies during pregnancy or by taking up antibodies from milk .,"['offspring', 'vaccinated_dams', 'transfer', 'maternal_antibodies', 'pregnancy', 'antibodies', 'milk']"
"Hyper-reactivity to non-specific challenges has been considered a hallmark of asthma and is defined as an abnormal responsiveness of the bronchial airways to a variety of provocative agents. The mechanisms underlying hyper-reactivity in the upper and lower airways are not known. By using the nose to study the inflammatory response possible abnormalities can be investigated carefully and pathophysiology of specific airway hyper-reactivities can be better understood. Other factors than merely constriction of the bronchial smooth muscles can cause narrowing of the free lumen to airflow.

"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media with perforation (AOMwiP) affects 40% of remote Indigenous children during the first 18 months of life. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the primary bacterial pathogens of otitis media and their loads predict clinical ear state. Our hypothesis is that antecedent respiratory viral infection increases bacterial density and progression to perforation. METHODS: A total of 366 nasopharyngeal swabs from 114 Indigenous children were retrospectively examined. A panel of 17 respiratory viruses was screened by PCR, and densities of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were estimated by quantitative real time PCR. Data are reported by clinical ear state. RESULTS: M. catarrhalis (96%), H. influenzae (91%), S. pneumoniae (89%) and respiratory viruses (59%) were common; including rhinovirus (HRV) (38%), polyomavirus (HPyV) (14%), adenovirus (HAdV) (13%), bocavirus (HBoV) (8%) and coronavirus (HCoV) (4%). Geometric mean bacterial loads were significantly higher in children with acute otitis media (AOM) compared to children without evidence of otitis media. Children infected with HAdV were 3 times more likely (p < 0.001) to have AOM with or without perforation. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a positive association between nasopharyngeal bacterial load and clinical ear state, exacerbated by respiratory viruses, in Indigenous children. HAdV was independently associated with acute ear states.",Our hypothesis is that antecedent respiratory viral infection increases bacterial density and progression to perforation.,"['Our_hypothesis', 'is', 'that', 'antecedent_respiratory_viral_infection', 'increases', 'bacterial_density', 'and', 'progression', 'to', 'perforation', '.']",Our_hypothesis is that antecedent_respiratory_viral_infection increases bacterial_density and progression to perforation .,"['Our_hypothesis', 'antecedent_respiratory_viral_infection', 'bacterial_density', 'progression', 'perforation']"
"Mathematical models provide a quantitative framework with which scientists can assess hypotheses on the potential underlying mechanisms that explain patterns in observed data at different spatial and temporal scales, generate estimates of key kinetic parameters, assess the impact of interventions, optimize the impact of control strategies, and generate forecasts. We review and illustrate a simple data assimilation framework for calibrating mathematical models based on ordinary differential equation models using time series data describing the temporal progression of case counts relating, for instance, to population growth or infectious disease transmission dynamics. In contrast to Bayesian estimation approaches that always raise the question of how to set priors for the parameters, this frequentist approach relies on modeling the error structure in the data. We discuss issues related to parameter identifiability, uncertainty quantification and propagation as well as model performance and forecasts along examples based on phenomenological and mechanistic models parameterized using simulated and real datasets.","Mathematical models provide a quantitative framework with which scientists can assess hypotheses on the potential underlying mechanisms that explain patterns in observed data at different spatial and temporal scales, generate estimates of key kinetic parameters, assess the impact of interventions, optimize the impact of control strategies, and generate forecasts.","['Mathematical_models', 'provide', 'a_quantitative_framework', 'with', 'which', 'scientists', 'can', 'assess', 'hypotheses', 'on', 'the_potential_underlying_mechanisms', 'that', 'explain', 'patterns', 'in', 'observed_data', 'at', 'different', 'spatial', 'and', 'temporal_scales', ',', 'generate', 'estimates', 'of', 'key_kinetic_parameters', ',', 'assess', 'the_impact', 'of', 'interventions', ',', 'optimize', 'the_impact', 'of', 'control_strategies', ',', 'and', 'generate', 'forecasts', '.']","Mathematical_models provide a_quantitative_framework with which scientists can assess hypotheses on the_potential_underlying_mechanisms that explain patterns in observed_data at different spatial and temporal_scales , generate estimates of key_kinetic_parameters , assess the_impact of interventions , optimize the_impact of control_strategies , and generate forecasts .","['Mathematical_models', 'a_quantitative_framework', 'scientists', 'hypotheses', 'the_potential_underlying_mechanisms', 'patterns', 'observed_data', 'different spatial', 'temporal_scales', 'generate', 'estimates', 'key_kinetic_parameters', 'the_impact', 'interventions', 'the_impact', 'control_strategies', 'forecasts']"
"We recently created a cystic fibrosis ferret model that acquires neonatal lung infection. To develop lung gene therapies for this model, we evaluated recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene transfer to the neonatal ferret lung. Unlike in vitro ferret airway epithelial (FAE) cells, in vivo infection of the ferret lung with rAAV1 required proteasome inhibitors to achieve efficient airway transduction. We hypothesized that differences in transduction between these two systems were because of an in vivo secreted factor that alter the transduction biology of rAAV1. Indeed, treatment of rAAV1 with ferret airway secretory fluid (ASF) strongly inhibited rAAV1, but not rAAV2, transduction of primary FAE and HeLa cells. Properties of the ASF inhibitory factor included a strong affinity for the AAV1 capsid, heat-stability, negative charge, and sensitivity to endoproteinase Glu-C. ASF-treated rAAV1 dramatically inhibited apical transduction of FAE ALI cultures (512-fold), while only reducing viral entry by 55-fold, suggesting that postentry processing of virus was influenced by the inhibitor factor. Proteasome inhibitors rescued transduction in the presence of ASF (∼1600-fold) without effecting virus internalization, while proteasome inhibitors only enhanced transduction 45-fold in the absence of ASF. These findings demonstrate that a factor in lung secretions can influence intracellular processing of rAAV1 in a proteasome-dependent fashion.",We hypothesized that differences in transduction between these two systems were because of an in vivo secreted factor that alter the transduction biology of rAAV1.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'differences', 'in', 'transduction', 'between', 'these_two_systems', 'were', 'because', 'of', 'an', 'in', 'vivo_secreted_factor', 'that', 'alter', 'the_transduction_biology', 'of', 'rAAV1', '.']",We hypothesized that differences in transduction between these_two_systems were because of an in vivo_secreted_factor that alter the_transduction_biology of rAAV1 .,"['differences', 'transduction', 'these_two_systems', 'an in vivo_secreted_factor', 'alter', 'the_transduction_biology', 'rAAV1']"
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused human respiratory infections with a high case fatality rate since 2012. However, the mode of virus transmission is not well understood. The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection. We demonstrated that human primary intestinal epithelial cells, small intestine explants, and intestinal organoids were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain robust viral replication. We also identified the evidence of enteric MERS-CoV infection in the stool specimen of a clinical patient. MERS-CoV was considerably resistant to fed-state gastrointestinal fluids but less tolerant to highly acidic fasted-state gastric fluid. In polarized Caco-2 cells cultured in Transwell inserts, apical MERS-CoV inoculation was more effective in establishing infection than basolateral inoculation. Notably, direct intragastric inoculation of MERS-CoV caused a lethal infection in human DPP4 transgenic mice. Histological examination revealed MERS-CoV enteric infection in all inoculated mice, as shown by the presence of virus-positive cells, progressive inflammation, and epithelial degeneration in small intestines, which were exaggerated in the mice pretreated with the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole. With the progression of the enteric infection, inflammation, virus-positive cells, and live viruses emerged in the lung tissues, indicating the development of sequential respiratory infection. Taken together, these data suggest that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative infection route for MERS-CoV.",The findings of epidemiological and virological studies prompted us to hypothesize that the human gastrointestinal tract could serve as an alternative route to acquire MERS-CoV infection.,"['The_findings', 'of', 'epidemiological_and_virological_studies', 'prompted', 'us', 'to', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_human_gastrointestinal_tract', 'could', 'serve', 'as', 'an_alternative_route', 'to', 'acquire', 'MERS-CoV_infection', '.']",The_findings of epidemiological_and_virological_studies prompted us to hypothesize that the_human_gastrointestinal_tract could serve as an_alternative_route to acquire MERS-CoV_infection .,"['The_findings', 'epidemiological_and_virological_studies', 'the_human_gastrointestinal_tract', 'an_alternative_route', 'MERS-CoV_infection']"
"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of acute lower respiratory tract disease in infants worldwide. As a first line of defense against respiratory infections, innate immune responses, including the production of type I and III interferons (IFNs), play an important role. Upon infection with RSV, multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can recognize RSV-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount innate immune responses. Retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) have been identified as important innate receptors to mount type I IFNs during RSV infection. However, type I IFN levels remain surprisingly low during RSV infection despite strong viral replication. The poor induction of type I IFNs can be attributed to the cooperative activity of 2 unique, nonstructural (NS) proteins of RSV, i.e., NS1 and NS2. These viral proteins have been shown to suppress both the production and signaling of type I and III IFNs by counteracting a plethora of key host innate signaling proteins. Moreover, increasing numbers of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are being identified as targets of the NS proteins in recent years, highlighting an underexplored protein family in the identification of NS target proteins. To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of NS1 was resolved recently and, remarkably, identified NS1 as a structural paralogue of the RSV matrix protein. Unfortunately, no structural data on NS2 have been published so far. In this review, we briefly describe the PRRs that mount innate immune responses upon RSV infection and provide an overview of the various effector functions of NS1 and NS2. Furthermore, we discuss the ubiquitination effector functions of NS1 and NS2, which are in line with the hypothesis that the NSD shares features with the canonical 26S proteasome.","To understand the diverse effector functions of NS1 and NS2, Goswami and colleagues proposed the hypothesis of the NS degradasome (NSD) complex, a multiprotein complex made up of, at least, NS1 and NS2.","['To', 'understand', 'the_diverse_effector_functions', 'of', 'NS1', 'and', 'NS2', ',', 'Goswami', 'and', 'colleagues', 'proposed', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'the_NS_degradasome_(NSD)_complex', ',', 'a_multiprotein_complex', 'made', 'up', 'of', ',', 'at_least,_NS1', 'and', 'NS2', '.']","To understand the_diverse_effector_functions of NS1 and NS2 , Goswami and colleagues proposed the_hypothesis of the_NS_degradasome_(NSD)_complex , a_multiprotein_complex made up of , at_least,_NS1 and NS2 .","['the_diverse_effector_functions', 'NS1', 'NS2', 'Goswami', 'colleagues', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_NS_degradasome_(NSD)_complex', 'a_multiprotein_complex', 'at_least,_NS1', 'NS2']"
"The high mutation rate of RNA viruses enables a diverse genetic population of viral genotypes to exist within a single infected host. In-host genetic diversity could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures such as host-switching events. Multiple new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples just within the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emergent human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of nearly 950×(454 sequencing) and 38,000×(Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the unpassaged samples and could quickly shift to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert coded for three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells, and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were “selected” from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.","Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were “selected” from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.","['Analysis', 'of', 'the_deep_sequencing_data', 'indicated', 'that', 'two', 'distinct', 'genotypes', 'circulated', 'at', 'different_frequency_levels', 'in', 'each_sample', ',', 'and', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_mutations', 'present', 'in', 'passaged_strains', 'were', '“', 'selected', '”', 'from', 'a_pre-existing_pool', 'rather', 'than', 'through', 'de_novo_mutation', 'and', 'subsequent_population_fixation', '.']","Analysis of the_deep_sequencing_data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different_frequency_levels in each_sample , and support the_hypothesis that the_mutations present in passaged_strains were “ selected ” from a_pre-existing_pool rather than through de_novo_mutation and subsequent_population_fixation .","['Analysis', 'the_deep_sequencing_data', 'genotypes', 'each_sample', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_mutations', 'passaged_strains', 'a_pre-existing_pool', 'de_novo_mutation', 'subsequent_population_fixation']"
"The aims of this study were to investigate the human bocavirus (HBoV) frequency and genotypes in hospitalized children <5 years presenting acute respiratory infections (ARI) within the São Paulo metropolitan area. Nasopharyngeal samples from 300 patients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were tested by qPCR for the NSP1 and NP-1 genes. The VP1/2 gene in positive samples was then amplified by PCR and sequenced. A total of 49 positive HBoV cases (16.3%; mean Ct value of 34.41) were detected with the mean age being 18.1 months (range 1 month to 5 years) and the median age being 1 year of age. Children aged between 0 and 12 months had higher detection rates of HBoV (69.4%; 34/49; mean Ct = 34.45) than children from other age groups (30.6%; 15/49; mean Ct = 34.34). No significant differences were observed between HBoV Ct levels and clinical illness. The occurrence was more frequently associated with fall (38.8%; 19/49) and spring (36.7%; 18/49). All 12 sequenced isolates were identified as HBoV-1, displaying minor genetic variation compared to the Swedish reference strains ST1 and ST2 (99.1–99.7% nt).

"Following the SARS outbreak, extensive surveillance was undertaken globally to detect and identify coronavirus diversity in bats. This study sought to identify the diversity and prevalence of coronaviruses in bats in the Australasian region. We identified four different genotypes of coronavirus, three of which (an alphacoronavirus and two betacoronaviruses) are potentially new species, having less than 90% nucleotide sequence identity with the most closely related described viruses. We did not detect any SARS-like betacoronaviruses, despite targeting rhinolophid bats, the putative natural host taxa. Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species. Similarly, we detected a novel betacoronavirus genotype from Pteropus alecto which is most closely related to Bat coronavirus HKU9 identified in other pteropodid bats in China, Kenya and the Philippines. We also detected possible cross-species transmission of bat coronaviruses, and the apparent enteric tropism of these viruses. Thus, our findings are consistent with a scenario wherein the current diversity and host specificity of coronaviruses reflects co-evolution with the occasional host shift.","Our findings support the virus-host co-evolution hypothesis, with the detection of Miniopterus bat coronavirus HKU8 (previously reported in Miniopterus species in China, Hong Kong and Bulgaria) in Australian Miniopterus species.","['Our_findings', 'support', 'the_virus-host_co-evolution_hypothesis', ',', 'with', 'the_detection', 'of', 'Miniopterus_bat_coronavirus_HKU8', '(', 'previously', 'reported', 'in', 'Miniopterus_species', 'in', 'China', ',', 'Hong_Kong', 'and', 'Bulgaria', ')', 'in', 'Australian_Miniopterus_species', '.']","Our_findings support the_virus-host_co-evolution_hypothesis , with the_detection of Miniopterus_bat_coronavirus_HKU8 ( previously reported in Miniopterus_species in China , Hong_Kong and Bulgaria ) in Australian_Miniopterus_species .","['Our_findings support the_virus-host_co-evolution_hypothesis', 'Miniopterus_bat_coronavirus_HKU8', 'Miniopterus_species', 'China', 'Hong_Kong', 'Bulgaria', 'Australian_Miniopterus_species']"
"Several viruses utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting mediated by mRNA pseudoknots in combination with a slippery sequence to produce a well defined stochiometric ratio of the upstream encoded to the downstream-encoded protein. A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.",Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.,"['Taking', 'ribosomal', 'roadblocking', 'into', 'account', 'is', 'a_prerequisite', 'for', 'formulating', 'correct_frameshifting_hypotheses', '.']",Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a_prerequisite for formulating correct_frameshifting_hypotheses .,"['account', 'a_prerequisite', 'correct_frameshifting_hypotheses']"
"OBJECTIVE: Because the decision to hospitalize an infant with bronchiolitis is often supported by subjective criteria and objective indicators of bronchiolitis severity are lacking, we tested the hypothesis that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is released from injured cells, is a useful biochemical indicator of bronchiolitis severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a study of children <24 months old presenting to the emergency department with bronchiolitis. Demographic, clinical information, nasal-wash (NW) and serum specimens were obtained. NW samples were analyzed for respiratory viruses, caspase 3/7 activity and a panel of cytokines and chemokines. Total LDH activity was tested in NW samples and sera. RESULTS: Of 101 enrolled children (median age, 5.6 months), 98 had NW specimens available. A viral etiology was found in 82 patients (83.6%), with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (66%) and rhinovirus (19%) being the most common viruses detected. Concentrations of LDH in NW specimens were independent from those in sera, and were higher in children with RSV infection or with dual infection. Significant correlations were found between NW LDH and NW cytokines/chemokines. Similarly, NW LDH correlated with NW-caspase 3/7 activity (r=0.75; P<.001). In a multivariate analysis, NW LDH concentration in the upper quartile was significantly associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization (odds ratio: 0.19; 95% confidence interval: 0.05–0.68; P=0.011). CONCLUSIONS: NW LDH levels in young children with bronchiolitis varied according to viral etiology and disease severity. Values in the upper quartile were associated with ~80% risk reduction in hospitalization, likely reflecting a robust antiviral response. NW LDH may be a useful biomarker to assist the clinician in the decision to hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis.","Because the decision to hospitalize an infant with bronchiolitis is often supported by subjective criteria and objective indicators of bronchiolitis severity are lacking, we tested the hypothesis that lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which is released from injured cells, is a useful biochemical indicator of bronchiolitis severity.","['Because', 'the_decision', 'to', 'hospitalize', 'an_infant', 'with', 'bronchiolitis', 'is', 'often', 'supported', 'by', 'subjective_criteria', 'and', 'objective_indicators', 'of', 'bronchiolitis_severity', 'are', 'lacking', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'lactate_dehydrogenase', '(LDH', ')', ',', 'which', 'is', 'released', 'from', 'injured_cells', ',', 'is', 'a_useful_biochemical_indicator', 'of', 'bronchiolitis_severity', '.']","Because the_decision to hospitalize an_infant with bronchiolitis is often supported by subjective_criteria and objective_indicators of bronchiolitis_severity are lacking , we tested the_hypothesis that lactate_dehydrogenase (LDH ) , which is released from injured_cells , is a_useful_biochemical_indicator of bronchiolitis_severity .","['the_decision', 'an_infant', 'bronchiolitis', 'subjective_criteria', 'objective_indicators', 'bronchiolitis_severity', 'the_hypothesis', 'lactate_dehydrogenase (LDH', 'injured_cells', 'a_useful_biochemical_indicator', 'bronchiolitis_severity']"
"Insectivorous bats are speculated to be ancestral hosts of Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV). MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFNβ) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFNβ in bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion.","Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells.","['Since', 'bats', 'experimentally', 'infected', 'with', 'MERS-CoV', 'do', 'not', 'develop', 'signs', 'of', 'disease', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'MERS-CoV', 'would', 'replicate', 'less', 'efficiently', 'in', 'bat_cells', 'than', 'in', 'human_cells', 'because', 'of', 'its_inability', 'to', 'subvert', 'antiviral_responses', 'in', 'bat_cells', '.']","Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease , we tested the_hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat_cells than in human_cells because of its_inability to subvert antiviral_responses in bat_cells .","['bats', 'MERS-CoV', 'signs', 'disease', 'the_hypothesis', 'MERS-CoV', 'bat_cells', 'human_cells', 'its_inability', 'antiviral_responses', 'bat_cells']"
"BACKGROUND: SARS coronavirus main proteinase (SARS CoVMpro) is an important enzyme for the replication of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus. The active site region of SARS CoVMpro is divided into 8 subsites. Understanding the binding mode of SARS CoVMpro with a specific substrate is useful and contributes to structural-based drug design. The purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the SARS CoVMpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the S3 subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. RESULTS: The one turn α-helix chain (residues 47–54) of the SARS CoVMpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S3 subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of Glu47. During MD simulations, Glu47 of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the P3Lys of the octapeptide.

"Non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) often occurs after corticosteroid therapy in patients with inflammatory diseases. Recent studies suggest that toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, and that the reason for corticosteroid therapy for inflammatory diseases is related to the anti-inflammatory activities of corticosteroids through the reduction of NF-κB. We hypothesized that the administration of TLR ligands in combination with corticosteroid causes ONFH and that transcription factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of ONFH. The aim of the study was to evaluate (1) the incidence of ONFH in rats after the administration of TLR7 or TLR9 ligands together with methylprednisolone (MPSL) and (2) whether transcription factors contribute to the development of ONFH. Male Wistar rats (n=148) were divided into five groups as follows: Group 1: Saline+MPSL, Group 2: Imiquimod+Saline, Group 3: Imiquimod+MPSL, Group 4: CpG-C+MPSL, Group 5: Imiquimod+BAY11-7082+MPSL. As a result, ONFH was observed in 0 of 12 rats in Group 1, in 1 of 10 in Group 2, in 6 of 12 in Group 3, in 4 of 12 in Group 4, in 0 of 9 in Group 5. MPSL treatment did not significantly affect IRF7 activity, whereas NF-κB activity was significantly repressed in Group 2 and Group 3. Furthermore, the repression in interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) activity by BAY11-7082 interfered with the development of ONFH simultaneously with the MPSL treatment-induced repression in NF-κB activity.

"Abstract Background Upper respiratory tract viral infections cause asthma exacerbations in children. However, the impact of natural colds on children with asthma in the community, particularly in the high-risk urban environment, is less well defined. Objective We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms. Methods We studied 53 children with asthma from Detroit, Michigan, during scheduled surveillance periods and self-reported respiratory illnesses for 1 year. Symptom score, spirometry, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal aspirate biomarkers, and viral nucleic acid and rhinovirus (RV) copy number were assessed. Results Of 658 aspirates collected, 22.9% of surveillance samples and 33.7% of respiratory illnesses were virus-positive. Compared with the virus-negative asymptomatic condition, children with severe colds (symptom score ≥5) showed reduced forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of the pulmonary volume (FEF25%-75%), higher nasal messenger RNA expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-10 and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, and higher protein abundance of CXCL8, CXCL10 and C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCL)-2, CCL4, CCL20, and CCL24. Children with mild (symptom score, 1-4) and asymptomatic infections showed normal airway function and fewer biomarker elevations. Virus-negative cold-like illnesses demonstrated increased FeNO, minimal biomarker elevation, and normal airflow. The RV copy number was associated with nasal chemokine levels but not symptom score. Conclusion Urban children with asthma with high-symptom respiratory viral infections have reduced FEF25%-75% and more elevations of nasal biomarkers than children with mild or symptomatic infections, or virus-negative illnesses.",We hypothesized that children with high-symptom upper respiratory viral infections have reduced airway function and greater respiratory tract inflammation than children with virus-positive low-symptom illnesses or virus-negative upper respiratory tract symptoms.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'children', 'with', 'high-symptom_upper_respiratory_viral_infections', 'have', 'reduced', 'airway_function', 'and', 'greater_respiratory_tract_inflammation', 'than', 'children', 'with', 'virus-positive_low-symptom_illnesses', 'or', 'virus-negative_upper_respiratory_tract_symptoms', '.']",We hypothesized that children with high-symptom_upper_respiratory_viral_infections have reduced airway_function and greater_respiratory_tract_inflammation than children with virus-positive_low-symptom_illnesses or virus-negative_upper_respiratory_tract_symptoms .,"['children', 'high-symptom_upper_respiratory_viral_infections', 'airway_function', 'greater_respiratory_tract_inflammation', 'children', 'virus-positive_low-symptom_illnesses', 'virus-negative_upper_respiratory_tract_symptoms']"
"Emerging evidences indicate that diminished activity of the vasoprotective axis of the renin–angiotensin system, constituting angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its enzymatic product, angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, long-term repetitive delivery of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) would require enhanced protein stability and ease of administration to improve patient compliance. Chloroplast expression of therapeutic proteins enables their bioencapsulation within plant cells to protect against gastric enzymatic degradation and facilitates long-term storage at room temperature. Besides, fusion to a transmucosal carrier helps effective systemic absorption from the intestine on oral delivery. We hypothesized that bioencapsulating ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) fused to the cholera nontoxin B subunit would enable development of an oral delivery system that is effective in treating PH. PH was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by monocrotaline administration. Subset of animals was simultaneously treated with bioencapsulaed ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) (prevention protocol). In a separate set of experiments, drug treatment was initiated after 2 weeks of PH induction (reversal protocol). Oral feeding of rats with bioencapsulated ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) prevented the development of monocrotaline-induced PH and improved associated cardiopulmonary pathophysiology. Furthermore, in the reversal protocol, oral ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) treatment significantly arrested disease progression, along with improvement in right heart function, and decrease in pulmonary vessel wall thickness. In addition, a combination therapy with ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) augmented the beneficial effects against monocrotaline-induced lung injury. Our study provides proof-of-concept for a novel low-cost oral ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) delivery system using transplastomic technology for pulmonary disease therapeutics.",We hypothesized that bioencapsulating ACE2 or Ang-(1-7) fused to the cholera nontoxin B subunit would enable development of an oral delivery system that is effective in treating PH.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'bioencapsulating', 'ACE2', 'or', 'Ang-(1', '-', '7', ')', 'fused', 'to', 'the_cholera_nontoxin_B_subunit', 'would', 'enable', 'development', 'of', 'an_oral_delivery_system', 'that', 'is', 'effective', 'in', 'treating', 'PH', '.']",We hypothesized that bioencapsulating ACE2 or Ang-(1 - 7 ) fused to the_cholera_nontoxin_B_subunit would enable development of an_oral_delivery_system that is effective in treating PH .,"['ACE2', 'Ang-(1', 'the_cholera_nontoxin_B_subunit', 'development', 'an_oral_delivery_system', 'PH']"
"Coat proteins of non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses must perform a variety of functions during their life cycle such as assembly of the coat protein subunits into a closed shell, specific encapsidation of the viral nucleic acid, maturation of the capsid, interaction with host receptors and disassembly to deliver the genetic information into the newly-infected cell. A thorough understanding of the multiple capsid properties at the molecular level is required in order to identify potential targets for antiviral therapy and the prevention of viral disease. The system we have chosen for study are the astroviruses, a family of icosahedral, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause disease in mammals and birds. Very little is known about what regions of the coat protein contribute to the diverse capsid functions. This review will present novel structural predictions for the coat protein sequence of different astrovirus family members. Based on these predictions, we hypothesize that the assembly and RNA packaging functions of the astrovirus coat protein constitutes an individual domain distinct from the determinants required for receptor binding and internalization. Information derived from these structural predictions will serve as an important tool in designing experiments to understand astrovirus biology.","Based on these predictions, we hypothesize that the assembly and RNA packaging functions of the astrovirus coat protein constitutes an individual domain distinct from the determinants required for receptor binding and internalization.","['Based', 'on', 'these_predictions', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_assembly', 'and', 'RNA_packaging_functions', 'of', 'the_astrovirus_coat_protein', 'constitutes', 'an', 'individual', 'domain', 'distinct', 'from', 'the_determinants', 'required', 'for', 'receptor_binding', 'and', 'internalization', '.']","Based on these_predictions , we hypothesize that the_assembly and RNA_packaging_functions of the_astrovirus_coat_protein constitutes an individual domain distinct from the_determinants required for receptor_binding and internalization .","['these_predictions', 'the_assembly', 'RNA_packaging_functions of the_astrovirus_coat_protein', 'domain', 'the_determinants', 'receptor_binding', 'internalization']"
"According to the free drug hypothesis only the unbound drug is available to act at physiological sites of action, and as such the importance of plasma protein binding primarily resides in its impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Of the major plasma proteins, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) represents an intriguing one primarily due to the high affinity, low capacity properties of this protein. In addition, there are marked species and age differences in protein expression, homology and drug binding affinity. As such, a thorough understanding of drug binding to AAG can help aid and improve the translation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from preclinical species to human as well as adults to neonates. This review provides a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the biochemistry of AAG; endogenous function, impact of disease, utility as a biomarker, and impact on PK/PD. Experimental considerations are discussed as well as recommendations for understanding the potential impact of AAG on PK through drug discovery and early development.","According to the free drug hypothesis only the unbound drug is available to act at physiological sites of action, and as such the importance of plasma protein binding primarily resides in its impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.","['According', 'to', 'the_free_drug_hypothesis', 'only_the_unbound_drug', 'is', 'available', 'to', 'act', 'at', 'physiological_sites', 'of', 'action', ',', 'and', 'as', 'such_the_importance', 'of', 'plasma', 'protein', 'binding', 'primarily', 'resides', 'in', 'its_impact', 'on', 'pharmacokinetics', 'and', 'pharmacodynamics', '.']","According to the_free_drug_hypothesis only_the_unbound_drug is available to act at physiological_sites of action , and as such_the_importance of plasma protein binding primarily resides in its_impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics .","['the_free_drug_hypothesis only_the_unbound_drug', 'physiological_sites', 'action', 'such_the_importance', 'plasma', 'protein', 'resides', 'its_impact', 'pharmacokinetics', 'pharmacodynamics']"

"A key process in the regulation of protein activities and thus cellular signaling pathways is the modification of proteins by post-translational mechanisms. Knowledge about the enzymes (writers and erasers) that attach and remove post-translational modifications, the targets that are modified and the functional consequences elicited by specific modifications, is crucial for understanding cell biological processes. Moreover detailed knowledge about these mechanisms and pathways helps to elucidate the molecular causes of various diseases and in defining potential targets for therapeutic approaches. Intracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation refers to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent modification of proteins with ADP-ribose and is catalyzed by enzymes of the ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin like, also known as PARP) family as well as some members of the Sirtuin family. Poly-ADP-ribosylation is relatively well understood with inhibitors being used as anti-cancer agents. However, the majority of ARTD enzymes and the ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins are restricted to catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation. Although writers, readers and erasers of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosylation have been identified only recently, it is becoming more and more evident that this reversible post-translational modification is capable of modulating key intracellular processes and signaling pathways. These include signal transduction mechanisms, stress pathways associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and stress granules, and chromatin-associated processes such as transcription and DNA repair. We hypothesize that mono-ADP-ribosylation controls, through these different pathways, the development of cancer and infectious diseases.","We hypothesize that mono-ADP-ribosylation controls, through these different pathways, the development of cancer and infectious diseases.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that_mono-ADP-ribosylation_controls', ',', 'through', 'these_different_pathways', ',', 'the_development', 'of', 'cancer', 'and', 'infectious_diseases', '.']","We hypothesize that_mono-ADP-ribosylation_controls , through these_different_pathways , the_development of cancer and infectious_diseases .","['that_mono-ADP-ribosylation_controls', 'these_different_pathways', 'the_development', 'cancer', 'infectious_diseases']"
"Targeting viral antigens for proteosomal degradation has previously been proposed as a means for immunogenicity augmentation. However, utilization of modified unstable antigens may be insufficient for potent T-cell cross-presentation by APCs, a mechanism that requires high levels of the antigenic protein. Therefore, we hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine utilizing a combination of proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions of an antigen in a prime/boost regimen may provide the most efficient CTL response. To address this hypothesis, we utilized conserved proteosome-resistant influenza A virus proteins M1 and NS1. Unstable versions of these polypeptides were constructed by destroying their 3-D structure via truncations or short insertions into predicted alpha-helical structures. These modified polypeptides were stabilized in the presence of the proteosome inhibitor MG132, strongly suggesting that they are degraded via a ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Importantly, with both M1 and NS1antigens, homologous DNA vaccination with a mixture of unstable and proteosome-resistant wt forms of these proteins resulted in significantly higher CTL activity than vaccination with either wt or degradable forms. The most dramatic effect was seen with NS1, where homologous immunization with a mixture of these two forms was the only regimen that produced a notable elevation of CTL response, compared to vaccination with the wt NS1. Additionally, for M1 protein, heterologous vaccination utilizing the unstable form as prime and wild type form as boost, demonstrated significant augmentation of the CTL response. These data indicate that combining proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant forms of an antigen during vaccination is advantageous.","Therefore, we hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine utilizing a combination of proteosome-sensitive and proteosome-resistant versions of an antigen in a prime/boost regimen may provide the most efficient CTL response.","['Therefore', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'a_recombinant_vaccine', 'utilizing', 'a_combination', 'of', 'proteosome-sensitive_and_proteosome-resistant_versions', 'of', 'an_antigen', 'in', 'a_prime/boost_regimen', 'may', 'provide', 'the_most_efficient_CTL_response', '.']","Therefore , we hypothesized that a_recombinant_vaccine utilizing a_combination of proteosome-sensitive_and_proteosome-resistant_versions of an_antigen in a_prime/boost_regimen may provide the_most_efficient_CTL_response .","['a_recombinant_vaccine', 'a_combination', 'proteosome-sensitive_and_proteosome-resistant_versions', 'an_antigen', 'a_prime/boost_regimen', 'the_most_efficient_CTL_response']"
"Several human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) and antibody fragments, including the best characterized in terms of structure-function b12 and Fab X5, exhibit relatively potent and broad HIV-1 neutralizing activity. However, the elicitation of b12 or b12-like antibodies in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. B12 is highly divergent from the closest corresponding germline antibody while X5 is less divergent. We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation. In support of this hypothesis we have previously found that a germline-like b12 (monovalent and bivalent scFv as an Fc fusion protein or IgG) lacks measurable binding to an Env as measured by ELISA with a sensitivity in the μM range [1]; here we present evidence confirming and expanding these findings for a panel of Envs. In contrast, a germline-like scFv X5 bound Env with high (nM) affinity. To begin to explore the maturation pathways of these antibodies we identified several possible b12 intermediate antibodies and tested their neutralizing activity. These intermediate antibodies neutralized only some HIV-1 isolates and with relatively weak potency. In contrast, germline-like scFv X5 neutralized a subset of the tested HIV-1 isolates with comparable efficiencies to that of the mature X5. These results could help explain the relatively high immunogenicity of the coreceptor binding site on gp120 and the abundance of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients (X5 is a CD4i antibody) as well as the maturation pathway of X5. They also can help identify antigens that can bind specifically to b12 germline and intermediate antibodies that together with Envs could be used as a conceptually novel type of candidate vaccines. Such candidate vaccines based on two or more immunogens could help guiding the immune system through complex maturation pathways for elicitation of antibodies that are similar or identical to antibodies with known properties.","We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation.","['We', 'have', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_relatively_high_degree', 'of', 'specific_somatic_hypermutations', 'may', 'preclude', 'binding', 'of', 'the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein', '(Env', ')', 'to', 'closest', 'germline_antibodies', ',', 'and', 'that', 'identifying', 'antibodies', 'that', 'are', 'intermediates', 'in', 'the_pathways', 'to', 'maturation', 'could', 'help', 'design_novel_vaccine_immunogens', 'to', 'guide', 'the_immune_system', 'for', 'their_enhanced_elicitation', '.']","We have hypothesized that the_relatively_high_degree of specific_somatic_hypermutations may preclude binding of the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein (Env ) to closest germline_antibodies , and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the_pathways to maturation could help design_novel_vaccine_immunogens to guide the_immune_system for their_enhanced_elicitation .","['the_relatively_high_degree', 'specific_somatic_hypermutations', 'binding', 'the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein', '(Env', 'closest germline_antibodies', 'antibodies', 'intermediates', 'the_pathways', 'maturation', 'the_immune_system']"
"BACKGROUND: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis, infects swine of all ages causing vomiting and diarrhea, in newborn piglets the mortality rate is near 100%. Intestinal epithelial cells are the primary target cells of TGEV. Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), which is highly expressed in piglets with anemia, may play a role in TGEV infection. However, the underlying mechanism of TGEV invasion remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Our study investigated the possibility that TfR1 can serve as a receptor for TGEV infection and enables the invasion and replication of TGEV. We observed that TGEV infection promoted TfR1 internalization, clustering, and co-localization with TfR1 early in infection, while TfR1 expression was significantly down-regulated as TGEV infection proceeded. TGEV infection and replication were inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or by decreasing TfR1 expression. TGEV infection increased in TGEV-susceptible ST or IPEC-J2 cell lines and TGEV-resistant Caco-2 cells when porcine TfR1 was over-expressed. Finally, we found that the TGEV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1, and that pre-incubating TGEV with a protein fragment containing the extracellular region of TfR1 blocked viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that TfR1 is an additional receptor for TGEV and assists TGEV invasion and replication.

"Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that induces membrane invaginations (spherules) in host cells. These harbor the viral replication complexes (RC) that synthesize viral RNA. Alphaviruses have four replicase or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), nsP1–4, expressed as polyprotein P1234. An early RC, which synthesizes minus-strand RNA, is formed by the polyprotein P123 and the polymerase nsP4. Further proteolytic cleavage results in a late RC consisting of nsP1–4 and synthesizing plus strands. Here, we show that only the late RCs are highly active in RNA synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that active RCs can be isolated from both virus-infected cells and cells transfected with the wild-type replicase in combination with a plasmid expressing a template RNA. When an uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4 were expressed together with a template, high levels of minus-strand RNA were produced in cells, but RCs isolated from these cells were hardly active in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the uncleavable polyprotein P123 and polymerase nsP4, which have previously been shown to form spherules even in the absence of the template, did not replicate an exogenous template. Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","Consequently, we hypothesize that the replicase proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a template.","['Consequently', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_replicase_proteins', 'were', 'sequestered', 'in', 'spherules', 'and', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'to', 'recruit', 'a_template', '.']","Consequently , we hypothesize that the_replicase_proteins were sequestered in spherules and were no longer able to recruit a_template .","['the_replicase_proteins', 'spherules', 'a_template']"

"Abstract Numerous adjunct therapeutic agents have been investigated for the treatment or control of fat mobilization syndrome in periparturient dairy cows. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of multiple i.v. injections of 10% butaphosphan and 0.005% cyanocobalamin combination (Catosal, Bayer Animal Health, Leverkusen, Germany) between 1 and 2 wk antepartum (a.p.) on the metabolism and health of dairy cows. Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5μg/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.p. and postpartum (p.p.). Health status and milk production were monitored p.p. Serum cyanocobalamin concentration increased in groups C6 and C3 p.p. Multiple daily i.v. injections of Catosal before parturition increased p.p. glucose availability, as evaluated by p.p. serum glucose concentration, and decreased peripheral fat mobilization and ketone body formation, as evaluated by p.p. serum nonesterified fatty acid and β-OH butyrate concentrations. The number of puerperal infections in the first 5 d after calving was decreased in group C6, relative to group C0. We conclude that multiple injections of Catosal during the close-up period have a beneficial effect on the metabolism of periparturient dairy cows.

CMt-positive saliva and blood samples were obtained from three prednisolone-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats that were infected intraperitoneally with CMt. Five SPF cats were inoculated with CMt-positive saliva or blood subcutaneously to mimic cat bites, and five cats were inoculated orally with blood or oronasally with saliva to mimic social contact. Blood samples were monitored for CMt infection using quantitative real-time PCR and for seroconversion using a novel western blot assay. Neither oronasal nor subcutaneous inoculation with CMt-positive saliva led to CMt infection in the recipient cats, as determined by PCR, independent of prior prednisolone treatment. However, when blood containing the same CMt dose was given subcutaneously, 4 of the 5 cats became PCR-positive, while none of the 5 cats inoculated orally with up to 500 μL of CMt-positive blood became PCR-positive. Subsequently, the latter cats were successfully subcutaneously infected with blood. All 13 CMt-exposed cats seroconverted. In conclusion, CMt transmission by social contact seems less likely than transmission by aggressive interaction. The latter transmission may occur if the recipient cat is exposed to blood from an infected cat.","Since CMt has been detected in the saliva of infected cats using PCR, we hypothesised that direct transmission via social or aggressive contact may occur.","['Since', 'CMt', 'has', 'been', 'detected', 'in', 'the_saliva', 'of', 'infected_cats', 'using', 'PCR', ',', 'we', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'direct_transmission', 'via', 'social_or_aggressive_contact', 'may', 'occur', '.']","Since CMt has been detected in the_saliva of infected_cats using PCR , we hypothesised that direct_transmission via social_or_aggressive_contact may occur .","['CMt', 'the_saliva', 'infected_cats', 'PCR', 'direct_transmission', 'social_or_aggressive_contact']"
"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are unique in encoding a 3′→5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication, likely via proofreading. nsp14 associates with the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp), and nsp14-ExoN activity is enhanced by binding nsp10, a small nonenzymatic protein. However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) relative to MHV-ExoN(−), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(−) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.",Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication.,"['Our_results', 'demonstrate', 'that', 'nsp10', 'is', 'important', 'for', 'CoV_replication_fidelity', 'and', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'nsp10', 'functions', 'to', 'regulate', 'nsp14-ExoN_activity', 'during', 'virus_replication', '.']",Our_results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV_replication_fidelity and support the_hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN_activity during virus_replication .,"['Our_results', 'CoV_replication_fidelity', 'the_hypothesis', 'functions', 'nsp14-ExoN_activity', 'virus_replication']"
"BACKGROUND: Currently, diagnosis of equine coronavirus (ECoV) relies on the exclusion of other infectious causes of enteric disease along with molecular detection of ECoV in feces or tissue. Although this approach is complete, it is costly and may not always be achievable. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low. Our objective was to determine whether systemically healthy horses and horses with gastrointestinal disorders shed ECoV in their feces at the time of admission to a referral hospital and after 48 hours of stress associated with hospitalization. ANIMALS: One‐hundred thirty adult horses admitted to the Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for gastrointestinal disease (n = 65) or for imaging under anesthesia (n = 65) that were hospitalized for 48 hours. Owner consent was obtained before sampling. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected at admission and 48 hours later. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for ECoV and electron microscopy (EM) were performed on all samples. RESULTS: Only 1 of 258 fecal samples was PCR‐positive for ECoV. Electron microscopy identified ECoV‐like particles in 9 of 258 samples, parvovirus‐like particles in 4 of 258 samples, and rotavirus‐like particles in 1 of 258 samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The presence of ECoV in feces of hospitalized adult horses was low. Thus, fecal samples that are PCR‐positive for ECoV in adult horses that have clinical signs consistent with this viral infection are likely to be of diagnostic relevance. The clinical relevance of the viruses observed using EM remains to be investigated.",We hypothesized that the overall fecal shedding of ECoV in hospitalized horses is low.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_overall_fecal_shedding', 'of', 'ECoV', 'in', 'hospitalized_horses', 'is', 'low', '.']",We hypothesized that the_overall_fecal_shedding of ECoV in hospitalized_horses is low .,['hospitalized_horses']
"The anti-malaria drug chloroquine is well known as autophagy inhibitor. Chloroquine has also been used as anti-inflammatory drugs to treat inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a dual effect in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury: chloroquine on the one hand could protect the liver against I/R injury via inhibition of inflammatory response, but on the other hand could aggravate liver I/R injury through inhibition of autophagy. Rats (n=6 per group) were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. At the early phase (i.e., 0–6 h after reperfusion), chloroquine treatment ameliorated liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines and fewer histopathologic changes. In contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury at the late phase of reperfusion (i.e., 24–48 h after reperfusion). The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine appeared to involve its ability to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1 release and inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver injury via inhibition of autophagy and induction of hepatic apoptosis at the late phase. In conclusion, chloroquine prevents ischemic liver damage at the early phase, but aggravates liver damage at the late phase in liver I/R injury. This dual role of chloroquine should be considered when using chloroquine as an inhibitor of inflammation or autophagy in I/R injury.",We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a dual effect in liver ischemia/reperfusion,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'chloroquine', 'could', 'have', 'a_dual_effect', 'in', 'liver_ischemia/reperfusion']",We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a_dual_effect in liver_ischemia/reperfusion,"['chloroquine', 'a_dual_effect', 'liver_ischemia/reperfusion']"
"In felids, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive (virus readily eliminated and never detectable) to progressive infection (persistent viremia and viral shedding). Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.","To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses.","['To', 'investigate', 'the_impact', 'of', 'low', 'FeLV', 'doses', 'on', 'young_cats', 'and', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'low_dose_exposure', 'may', 'lead', 'to', 'an_unknown_pathogenesis', 'of', 'infection', 'without', 'involvement', 'of', 'the_bone_marrow', ',', '21_cats', 'were', 'infected', 'oronasally', 'with', 'variable_viral_doses', '.']","To investigate the_impact of low FeLV doses on young_cats and to test the_hypothesis that low_dose_exposure may lead to an_unknown_pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the_bone_marrow , 21_cats were infected oronasally with variable_viral_doses .","['the_impact', 'FeLV', 'young_cats', 'the_hypothesis', 'low_dose_exposure', 'an_unknown_pathogenesis', 'infection', 'involvement', 'the_bone_marrow', '21_cats', 'variable_viral_doses']"
"Streptococci may colonize the epithelium in the airways and other entry sites. While local infection often remains asymptomatic, severe or even fatal diseases occur when streptococci become invasive and spread to different sites in the infected host. We have established porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures (ALI) from the porcine lung to analyze the interaction of streptococci with their primary target cells. As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells. We hypothesize that soluble effectors such as suilysin are present at higher concentrations in cells kept at ALI conditions and thus more effective. These results should be relevant also for infection of the respiratory tract by other respiratory pathogens.",We hypothesize that soluble effectors such as suilysin are present at higher concentrations in cells kept at ALI conditions and thus more effective.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'soluble_effectors', 'such', 'as', 'suilysin', 'are', 'present', 'at', 'higher_concentrations', 'in', 'cells', 'kept', 'at', 'ALI_conditions', 'and', 'thus', 'more', 'effective', '.']",We hypothesize that soluble_effectors such as suilysin are present at higher_concentrations in cells kept at ALI_conditions and thus more effective .,"['soluble_effectors', 'suilysin', 'cells', 'ALI_conditions']"
"Abstract Several human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) including b12, 2G12, and 2F5 exhibit relatively potent and broad HIV-1-neutralizing activity. However, their elicitation in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using “holes” (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire. To begin to test this hypothesis we have designed germline-like antibodies corresponding most closely to b12, 2G12, and 2F5 as well as to X5, m44, and m46 which are cross-reactive but with relatively modest neutralizing activity as natively occurring antibodies due to size and/or other effects. The germline-like X5, m44, and m46 bound with relatively high affinity to all tested Envs. In contrast, germline-like b12, 2G12, and 2F5 lacked measurable binding to Envs in an ELISA assay although the corresponding mature antibodies did. These results provide initial evidence that Env structures containing conserved vulnerable epitopes may not initiate humoral responses by binding to germline antibodies. Even if such responses are initiated by very weak binding undetectable in our assay it is likely that they will be outcompeted by responses to structures containing the epitopes of X5, m44, m46, and other antibodies that bind germline BCRs with much higher affinity/avidity. This hypothesis, if further supported by data, could contribute to our understanding of how HIV-1 evades immune responses and offer new concepts for design of effective vaccine immunogens.",We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a strategy to reduce or eliminate the immunogenicity of the highly conserved epitopes of such antibodies by using “holes” (absence or very weak binding to these epitopes of germline antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an efficient immune response) in the human germline B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire.,"['We', 'have', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'HIV-1', 'has', 'evolved', 'a_strategy', 'to', 'reduce', 'or', 'eliminate', 'the_immunogenicity', 'of', 'the_highly_conserved_epitopes', 'of', 'such_antibodies', 'by', 'using', '“holes', '”', '(', 'absence', 'or', 'very', 'weak', 'binding', 'to', 'these_epitopes', 'of', 'germline_antibodies', 'that', 'is', 'not', 'sufficient', 'to', 'initiate', 'and/or', 'maintain', 'an_efficient_immune_response', ')', 'in', 'the_human_germline_B_cell_receptor', '(BCR)_repertoire', '.']",We have hypothesized that HIV-1 has evolved a_strategy to reduce or eliminate the_immunogenicity of the_highly_conserved_epitopes of such_antibodies by using “holes ” ( absence or very weak binding to these_epitopes of germline_antibodies that is not sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an_efficient_immune_response ) in the_human_germline_B_cell_receptor (BCR)_repertoire .,"['HIV-1', 'a_strategy', 'the_immunogenicity', 'the_highly_conserved_epitopes', 'such_antibodies', '“holes', 'absence', 'binding', 'these_epitopes', 'germline_antibodies', 'an_efficient_immune_response', 'the_human_germline_B_cell_receptor']"
"Rationale: After lung transplantation, insults to the allograft generally result in one of four histopathologic patterns of injury: (1) acute rejection, (2) lymphocytic bronchiolitis, (3) organizing pneumonia, and (4) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). We hypothesized that DAD, the most severe form of acute lung injury, would lead to the highest risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and that a type I immune response would mediate this process. Objectives: Determine whether DAD is associated with CLAD and explore the potential role of CXCR3/ligand biology. Methods: Transbronchial biopsies from all lung transplant recipients were reviewed. The association between the four injury patterns and subsequent outcomes were evaluated using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, and CXCL11/ITAC) were compared between allograft injury patterns and “healthy” biopsies using linear mixed-effects models. The effect of these chemokine alterations on CLAD risk was assessed using Cox models with serial BAL measurements as time-dependent covariates. Measurements and Main Results: There were 1,585 biopsies from 441 recipients with 62 episodes of DAD. An episode of DAD was associated with increased risk of CLAD (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–4.7) and death (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.0). There were marked elevations in BAL CXCR3 ligand concentrations during DAD. Furthermore, prolonged elevation of these chemokines in serial BAL fluid measurements predicted the development of CLAD. Conclusions: DAD is associated with marked increases in the risk of CLAD and death after lung transplantation. This association may be mediated in part by an aberrant type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligands.","We hypothesized that DAD, the most severe form of acute lung injury, would lead to the highest risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and that a type I immune response would mediate this process.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'DAD', ',', 'the_most_severe_form', 'of', 'acute_lung_injury', ',', 'would', 'lead', 'to', 'the_highest_risk', 'of', 'chronic_lung_allograft_dysfunction', '(', 'CLAD', ')', 'and', 'that', 'a_type', 'I_immune_response', 'would', 'mediate', 'this_process', '.']","We hypothesized that DAD , the_most_severe_form of acute_lung_injury , would lead to the_highest_risk of chronic_lung_allograft_dysfunction ( CLAD ) and that a_type I_immune_response would mediate this_process .","['that DAD', 'acute_lung_injury', 'the_highest_risk', 'chronic_lung_allograft_dysfunction', '( CLAD', 'a_type I_immune_response', 'this_process']"
"Background: The human bocavirus (HBoV) is known to persist latently in the infected host cells and seems to replicate its DNA via the DNA damage response system, which is frequently defect in tumors and correlates with microsatellite instability (MSI). Because HBoV is able to persist in the infected tissues, induces pro-fibrotic and pro- cancerogenic cytokines in vivo and in vitro, and is detected in colorectal and lung tumors, the virus may be involved in cancerogenesis at least as a cofactor. Recently it was shown that the adenotonsillar tissue is an important site of HBoV1 persistence and replication. Considering the background that approximately 60% of oropharyngeal cancers were thought to be attributable to a HPV infection, a co-participation of HBoV in terms of a chronic virus infection might play a role in the cancerogenesis of tonsil tumors. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tonsil tumor samples were screened for HBoV and HPV DNA. Positive tissue sections were afterward subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to identify HBoV and HPV infected cells. By use of an in vitro cell culture model with primary tonsil fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes infected by HBoV we tried to find the target cells of virus replication. MSI testing was based on a previously published protocol using a de-multiplexed PCR followed by fluorescent detection of PCR products in a capillary sequencing device. Results: In total 62 of 103 (60, 19%) of the tonsil squamous cell carcinomas tested positive for HBoV DNA and 66 of 103 (66%) samples were identified as HPV positive. The FISH analysis revealed both double infection of HPV and HBoV in the same cells as well as single infections of both viruses within the tumor tissue. Twenty-two of 62 HBoV positive tumors tested HPV negative, 40 of 62 tissue sections were HBoV and HPV positive. We analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors for MSI. Of those four tonsils displayed MSI in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that human bocavirus infections as a cofactor may have an impact on tumor development in tonsils, although it still remains possible that HBoV solely displays a tumor tropism.",Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis,"['Conclusion', ':', 'Our_findings', 'support', 'the_hypothesis']",Conclusion : Our_findings support the_hypothesis,"['Conclusion', 'Our_findings', 'support', 'the_hypothesis']"
"Background: Although WU polyomavirus (WU) and KI polyomavirus (KI) have been demonstrated to infect the human respiratory tract, it remains unclear if WU or KI cause human disease. We sought to further investigate the relationship between WU and KI infection and respiratory disease in a pediatric population with respiratory symptoms in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms in a Singaporean pediatrics hospital. Upon consent, residual respiratory samples from pediatric inpatients, previously screened for common respiratory viruses, were collected and further screened for WU and KI using qPCR. The amplicons of positive samples were sequenced for confirmation. The severity of a patient's illness was assessed by chart review post-discharge looking for clinical markers of respiratory status such as presenting symptoms, diagnoses, and interventions. Results: From December 2016 to April 2017, 201 patients with residual respiratory samples were enrolled in the study. The average age of all participants recruited was 45 months. WU and KI were detected in 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) of patients, respectively. Conducting bivariate and multivariate modeling, patients with WU or KI positivity were not at increased risk of SARI, need for additional oxygen, intravenous fluids, and did not receive additional oral antibiotics or bronchodilators during admission. In contrast, patients with RSV detections were at increased risk of requiring supplemental oxygen during hospital admission.

"Central players of the adaptive immune system are the groups of proteins encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which shape the immune response against pathogens and tolerance to self-peptides. The corresponding genomic region is of particular interest, as it harbors more disease associations than any other region in the human genome, including associations with infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Certain MHC molecules can bind to a much wider range of epitopes than others, but the functional implication of such an elevated epitope-binding repertoire has remained largely unclear. It has been suggested that by recognizing more peptide segments, such promiscuous MHC molecules promote immune response against a broader range of pathogens. If so, the geographical distribution of MHC promiscuity level should be shaped by pathogen diversity. Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis. First, we found that in pathogen-rich geographical regions, humans are more likely to carry highly promiscuous MHC class II DRB1 alleles. Second, the switch between specialist and generalist antigen presentation has occurred repeatedly and in a rapid manner during human evolution. Third, molecular positions that define promiscuity level of MHC class II molecules are especially diverse and are under positive selection in human populations. Taken together, our work indicates that pathogen load maintains generalist adaptive immune recognition, with implications for medical genetics and epidemiology.",Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis.,"['Three_lines', 'of', 'evidence', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', '.']",Three_lines of evidence support the_hypothesis .,"['Three_lines', 'evidence', 'support', 'the_hypothesis']"
"Patrick Manson, a clinician-scientist serving in China (1866–1889), discovered that many tropical infectious diseases require a vector peculiar to warm climate for person to person transmission. He demonstrated the nocturnal periodicity of microfilariae in the blood of patients with elephantiasis. These microfilariae undergo metamorphosis when ingested by the mosquito acting as the vector for the completion of their life cycle. Furthermore, he demonstrated the linkage between the lung fluke and endemic haemoptysis by finding operculated eggs in patients' sputa. He predicted that the miracidium from hatched eggs uses crustaceans, such as fresh-water snails found at tropical conditions, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle of many trematodes. His vector hypothesis leads to vector control which is now the cornerstone for the World Health Organization's programme for the elimination/control of lymphatic filariasis, dracunculiasis and malaria.

"Infection by Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a model for neurological outcomes caused by virus infection because it leads to diverse neurological conditions in mice, depending on the strain infected. To extend knowledge on the heterogeneous neurological outcomes caused by TMEV and identify new models of human neurological diseases associated with antecedent infections, we analyzed the phenotypic consequences of TMEV infection in the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population. We evaluated 5 different CC strains for outcomes of long-term infection (3 months) and acute vs. early chronic infection (7 vs. 28 days post-infection), using neurological and behavioral phenotyping tests and histology. We correlated phenotypic observations with haplotypes of genomic regions previously linked to TMEV susceptibility to test the hypothesis that genomic diversity within CC mice results in variable disease phenotypes in response to TMEV. None of the 5 strains analyzed had a response identical to that of any other CC strain or inbred strain for which prior data are available, indicating that strains of the CC can produce novel models of neurological disease.

"HIV-1 infects gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) very early after transmission by multiple routes. The infected GALT consequently serves as the major reservoir for HIV-1 infection and could constantly shed HIV-1 and CD4(+ )T cells into the intestinal lumen.

In urine samples, HIV-1 DNA was detected in 24% of infected subjects with detectable plasma viral load and 23% of subjects on ART with undetectable plasma viral load. Phylogenetic analysis of the envelope sequences of HIV-1 revealed distinct virus populations in concurrently collected serum, feces and urine samples from one subject.

"BACKGROUND: Sporozoite immunization of animals and humans under a chemo-prophylactic cover of chloroquine (CPS-CQ) efficiently induces sterile protection against malaria. In humans, CPS-CQ is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to CQ. Chloroquine, an established anti-malarial drug, is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of CQ during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in Plasmodium berghei models. METHODS: A number of experiments in selected complimentary P. berghei murine models in Balb/cByJ and C57BL/6j mice was performed. First, the effect of CQ administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by RAS immunization was studied. Next, the effect of CQ on the induction of circumsporozoite (CS) protein-specific CD8(+) T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites expressing a mutant CS protein was investigated. Finally, a direct comparison of CPS-CQ to CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects, was performed. RESULTS: When CQ was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of RAS, this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory CD8(+) T cells or CS protein-specific CD8(+) T cells. Also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered. Replacement of CQ by MQ for CPS immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of IFNγ producing memory T cells in the liver (p = 0.01), but similar protection. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of CQ on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in P. berghei malaria models. Alternatively, the higher efficiency of CPS compared to RAS might be explained by an indirect effect of CQ through limiting blood-stage exposure after immunization or to increased antigen exposure and, therefore, improved breadth of the immune response.

"BACKGROUND: In mid-June 2009 the State of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.",We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced.,"['We', 'hypothesise', 'that', 'this', 'was', 'because', 'community_transmission', 'of', 'pandemic_influenza', 'was', 'already', 'well', 'established', 'in', 'Victoria', 'at', 'the_time', 'testing', 'for', 'the_novel_virus', 'commenced', '.']",We hypothesise that this was because community_transmission of pandemic_influenza was already well established in Victoria at the_time testing for the_novel_virus commenced .,"['community_transmission', 'pandemic_influenza', 'Victoria', 'the_time testing', 'the_novel_virus']"
"PURPOSE: To provide current knowledge on respiratory virus-induced heterologous immunity (HI) with a focus on humoral and cellular cross-reactivity. Adaptive heterologous immune responses have broad implications on infection, autoimmunity, allergy and transplant immunology. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved might ultimately open up possibilities for disease prevention, for example by vaccination. METHODS: A structured literature search was performed using Medline and PubMed to provide an overview of the current knowledge on respiratory-virus induced adaptive HI. RESULTS: In HI the immune response towards one antigen results in an alteration of the immune response towards a second antigen. We provide an overview of respiratory virus-induced HI, including viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus (CoV) and influenza virus (IV). We discuss T cell receptor (TCR) and humoral cross-reactivity as mechanisms of HI involving those respiratory viruses. Topics covered include HI between respiratory viruses as well as between respiratory viruses and other pathogens. Newly developed vaccines which have the potential to provide protection against multiple virus strains are also discussed. Furthermore, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as narcolepsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, type 1 diabetes or myocarditis. Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma. CONCLUSION: Respiratory-virus induced HI may have protective but also detrimental effects on the host. Respiratory viral infections contribute to asthma or autoimmune disease development, but on the other hand, a lack of microbial encounter is associated with an increasing number of allergic as well as autoimmune diseases. Future research might help identify the elements which determine a protective or detrimental outcome in HI-based mechanisms.","Finally, we discuss the role of respiratory viruses in asthma and the hygiene hypothesis, and review our recent findings on HI between IV and allergens, which leads to protection from experimental asthma.","['Finally', ',', 'we', 'discuss', 'the_role', 'of', 'respiratory_viruses', 'in', 'asthma', 'and', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', ',', 'and', 'review', 'our_recent_findings', 'on', 'HI', 'between', 'IV', 'and', 'allergens', ',', 'which', 'leads', 'to', 'protection', 'from', 'experimental_asthma', '.']","Finally , we discuss the_role of respiratory_viruses in asthma and the_hygiene_hypothesis , and review our_recent_findings on HI between IV and allergens , which leads to protection from experimental_asthma .","['the_role', 'respiratory_viruses', 'asthma', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', 'our_recent_findings', 'HI', 'IV', 'allergens', 'protection', 'experimental_asthma']"
"BACKGROUND: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has been reported to occur in a sporadic manner and in clusters of cases. We hypothesized that variations in the incidence of NEC were random, without clustering. In order to define the pattern of NEC in the United States, we analyzed the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to evaluate whether NEC cases are distributed randomly or exhibit temporal clustering or periodicity. METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we queried the PHIS database for all patients with NEC (ICD-9 code of 777.5) over a 13-year period. Sixteen children’s hospitals were studied, and individual institutional and aggregate data were reviewed. Fisher’s Kappa and Bartlett’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used to identify periodicity. RESULTS: During the study interval, there were 2,93,076 neonatal admissions, and 4,559 (1.6%) infants were diagnosed with NEC. Statistical analysis demonstrates a periodicity of 6 months in the occurrence of NEC. Fisher’s Kappa was 16.924 and Bartlett’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov was 0.281, which translates to a P value of <0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a national database analysis it appears a temporally non-random distribution of NEC cases does exist.","We hypothesized that variations in the incidence of NEC were random, without clustering.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'variations', 'in', 'the_incidence', 'of', 'NEC', 'were', 'random', ',', 'without', 'clustering', '.']","We hypothesized that variations in the_incidence of NEC were random , without clustering .","['variations', 'the_incidence', 'NEC']"
"The frequency of reported outbreaks of infectious diseases has increased over the past 3 decades, with predictions that this rise will continue. Outbreak response continues to follow nine basic principles: establish the presence of an outbreak, verify the diagnosis, make a case definition, find cases and contacts, conduct basic epidemiology, test hypotheses, institute control measures, communicate the situation and establish ongoing surveillance. Within each of these areas, significant advances have been made over the past 5 years using progress in digital, laboratory, epidemiology and anthropological equipment or techniques. Irrespective of these, future outbreaks of high-consequence are inevitable, and vigilance and preparation must continue in order to prevent significant mortality, morbidity and socio-economic crisis.","Outbreak response continues to follow nine basic principles: establish the presence of an outbreak, verify the diagnosis, make a case definition, find cases and contacts, conduct basic epidemiology, test hypotheses, institute control measures, communicate the situation and establish ongoing surveillance.","['Outbreak_response', 'continues', 'to', 'follow', 'nine_basic_principles', ':', 'establish', 'the_presence', 'of', 'an_outbreak', ',', 'verify', 'the_diagnosis', ',', 'make', 'a_case_definition', ',', 'find', 'cases', 'and', 'contacts', ',', 'conduct', 'basic_epidemiology', ',', 'test_hypotheses', ',', 'institute_control_measures', ',', 'communicate', 'the_situation', 'and', 'establish', 'ongoing_surveillance', '.']","Outbreak_response continues to follow nine_basic_principles : establish the_presence of an_outbreak , verify the_diagnosis , make a_case_definition , find cases and contacts , conduct basic_epidemiology , test_hypotheses , institute_control_measures , communicate the_situation and establish ongoing_surveillance .","['Outbreak_response', 'nine_basic_principles', 'the_presence', 'an_outbreak', 'the_diagnosis', 'a_case_definition', 'cases', 'contacts', 'basic_epidemiology', 'test_hypotheses', 'institute_control_measures', 'the_situation', 'ongoing_surveillance']"
"INTRODUCTION: On 17 September 2015, Buliisa District Health Office reported multiple deaths due to haemorrhage to the Uganda Ministry of Health. We conducted an investigation to verify the existence of an outbreak and to identify the disease nature, mode of transmission and risk factors. METHODS: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed case-patients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (± 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. RESULTS: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness. In the case-control study, 42% (5/12) of cases vs. 0.0% (0/77) of controls had liver disease (OR(M-H) = ∞; 95%CI = 3.7-∞); 71% (10/14) of cases vs. 35% (28/81) of controls had ulcer disease (OR(M-H) = 13; 95% CI = 1.6-98); 27% (3/11) of cases vs. 14% (11/81) of controls used indomethacin prior to disease onset (OR(M-H) = 6.0; 95% CI = 1.0-36). None of the blood samples were positive for any of the VHFs. CONCLUSION: This reported cluster of hematemesis illness was due to predisposing conditions and use of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID).

"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells, ultimately leading to liver failure. The serological hallmark of PBC is the presence of high-titer antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) against the inner lipoyl domain of E2 subunits of 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes, in particular the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). The initiating events triggering the autoimmune response are not yet identified but the hypothesis of molecular mimicry is a widely proposed mechanism for the development of autoimmunity in PBC. Several candidates, including bacteria and viruses have been suggested as causative agents, but also environmental factors, such as chemical xenobiotics, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis. In this review, we will discuss our current knowledge of the immunoreactivity of xenobiotically modified PDC peptide antigens. In addition, we will provide a working hypothesis how xenobiotic modification of antigens might occur that ultimately leads to the breaking of self-tolerance and the induction of PBC.",The initiating events triggering the autoimmune response are not yet identified but the hypothesis of molecular mimicry is a widely proposed mechanism for the development of autoimmunity in PBC.,"['The_initiating_events', 'triggering', 'the_autoimmune_response', 'are', 'not', 'yet', 'identified', 'but', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'molecular_mimicry', 'is', 'a_widely_proposed_mechanism', 'for', 'the_development', 'of', 'autoimmunity', 'in', 'PBC', '.']",The_initiating_events triggering the_autoimmune_response are not yet identified but the_hypothesis of molecular_mimicry is a_widely_proposed_mechanism for the_development of autoimmunity in PBC .,"['The_initiating_events', 'the_autoimmune_response', 'the_hypothesis', 'molecular_mimicry', 'a_widely_proposed_mechanism', 'the_development', 'autoimmunity', 'PBC']"
"BACKGROUND: The homogeneous mixing assumption is widely adopted in epidemic modelling for its parsimony and represents the building block of more complex approaches, including very detailed agent-based models. The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics. METHODS: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes. RESULTS: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

"BACKGROUND: The family of ubiquitin-like molecules (UbLs) comprises several members, each of which has sequence, structural, or functional similarity to ubiquitin. ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. ISG15 can be covalently attached to proteins, analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors. Specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their C-termini and substrate proteins. The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15. RESULTS: We have cloned and expressed 22 human DUBs, representing the major clades of the USP protease family. Utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and ISG15, we have identified USP2, USP5 (IsoT1), USP13 (IsoT3), and USP14 as ISG15-reactive proteases, in addition to the bona fide ISG15-specific protease USP18 (UBP43). USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB, and its ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: By evolutionary standards, ISG15 is a newcomer among the UbLs and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin. Functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice.","The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15.","['The_tail_regions', 'of', 'ubiquitin', 'and', 'ISG15', 'are', 'identical', 'and', 'we', 'therefore', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'promiscuous_deubiquitinating_proteases', '(', 'DUBs', ')', 'might', 'exist', ',', 'capable', 'of', 'recognizing', 'both_ubiquitin', 'and', 'ISG15', '.']","The_tail_regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous_deubiquitinating_proteases ( DUBs ) might exist , capable of recognizing both_ubiquitin and ISG15 .","['The_tail_regions', 'ubiquitin', 'ISG15', 'promiscuous_deubiquitinating_proteases', '( DUBs', 'both_ubiquitin', 'ISG15']"
"BACKGROUND: Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) locally maintained through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling. Microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation, but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that CSF1R plays a critical role in myeloid cell responses that restrict viral replication and locally restimulate recruited antiviral T cells within the CNS. METHODS: The impact of CSF1R signaling during West Nile virus infection was assessed in vivo using a mouse model of neurotropic infection. Pharmacological inactivation of CSF1R was achieved using PLX5622 prior to infection with virulent or attenuated strains of West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging neuropathogen. The subsequent effect of CSF1R antagonism on virologic control was assessed by measuring mortality and viral titers in the CNS and peripheral organs. Immune responses were assessed by flow cytometric-based phenotypic analyses of both peripheral and CNS immune cells. RESULTS: Mice treated with CSF1R antagonist prior to infection exhibited higher susceptibility to lethal WNV infection and lack of virologic control in both the CNS and periphery. CSFR1 antagonism reduced B7 co-stimulatory signals on peripheral and CNS antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by depleting CNS cellular sources, which limited local reactivation of CNS-infiltrating virus-specific T cells and reduced viral clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the impact of CSF1R antagonism on APC activation in the CNS and periphery and the importance of microglia in orchestrating the CNS immune response following neurotropic viral infection. These data will be an important consideration when assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, which has been investigated as a therapeutic for neurodegenerative conditions, in which neuroinflammation is a contributing factor.

"Since the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, there have been a number of clusters of human-to-human transmission. These cases of human-to-human transmission involve close contact and have occurred primarily in healthcare settings, and they are suspected to result from repeated zoonotic introductions. In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.",These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.,"['These_data', 'demonstrate', 'a_genetic_link', 'for', 'each', 'of', 'these_clusters', 'to', 'a_camel', 'and', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'human_MERS-CoV_diversity', 'results', 'from', 'multiple_zoonotic_introductions', '.']",These_data demonstrate a_genetic_link for each of these_clusters to a_camel and support the_hypothesis that human_MERS-CoV_diversity results from multiple_zoonotic_introductions .,"['These_data', 'a_genetic_link', 'these_clusters', 'a_camel', 'the_hypothesis', 'human_MERS-CoV_diversity', 'multiple_zoonotic_introductions']"
"Exosomes are small 30–100 nm membrane vesicles released from hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells and function to promote intercellular communication. They are generated through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and release of interluminal vesicles. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that macrophages infected with Mycobacterium release exosomes that promote activation of both innate and acquired immune responses; however, the components present on exosomes inducing these host responses were not defined. The present study used LC-MS/MS to identify 41 mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M. tuberculosis-infected J774 cells. Many of these proteins have been characterized as highly immunogenic. Further, since most of the mycobacterial proteins identified are actively secreted, we hypothesized that macrophages treated with M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins (CFP) would release exosomes containing mycobacterial proteins. We found 29 M. tuberculosis proteins in exosomes released from CFP-treated J774 cells, the majority of which were also present on exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis-infected cells. The exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could promote macrophage and dendritic cell activation as well as activation of naïve T cells in vivo.

"RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication (albeit within a permissive host environment). A 33.5 kilobase (kb) nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is in the 100–300 kb range. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps towards DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of the size constraints on RNP entities and the role of genome size in virus adaptation. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20–34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with the acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) encoded in the open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) in a monophyletic subset of nidoviruses. However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region including unannotated domains, and overall 41.1-kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, as well as key replicative domains. These domains may include functionally relevant substitutions rarely or never before observed in highly conserved sites of RdRp, NiRAN, ExoN and 3CLpro. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts, e.g. Ankyrin and Fibronectin type II, which might modulate virus-host interactions. PSCNV's greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features–impressive in themselves–attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery.","However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of these viral RNA genomes.","['However', ',', 'apparent_constraints', 'on', 'the_size', 'of', 'ORF1b', ',', 'which', 'encodes', 'this', 'and', 'other_key_replicative_enzymes', ',', 'have', 'been', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'limit', 'further_expansion', 'of', 'these_viral_RNA_genomes', '.']","However , apparent_constraints on the_size of ORF1b , which encodes this and other_key_replicative_enzymes , have been hypothesized to limit further_expansion of these_viral_RNA_genomes .","['However , apparent_constraints', 'the_size', 'ORF1b', 'other_key_replicative_enzymes', 'further_expansion', 'these_viral_RNA_genomes']"
"Viruses are suspected of significant roles in autoimmune diseases but the mechanisms are unclear. We get some insight by considering demands a virus places on host cells. Viruses not only require production of their own proteins, RNA and/or DNA, but also production of additional cellular machinery, such as ribosomes, to handle the increased demands. Since the nucleolus is a major site of RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly, nucleoli are targeted by viruses, directly when viral RNA and proteins enter the nucleolus and indirectly when viruses induce increased expression of cellular polyamine genes. Polyamines are at high levels in nucleoli to assist in RNA folding. The size and activity of nucleoli increase directly with increases in polyamines. Nucleolar expansion due to abnormal increases in polyamines could disrupt nearby chromatin, such as the inactive X chromosome, leading to expression of previously sequestered DNA. Sudden expression of a large concentration of Alu elements from the disrupted inactive X can compete with RNA transcripts containing intronic Alu sequences that normally maintain nucleolar structural integrity. Such disruption of nucleolar activity can lead to misfolded RNAs, misassembled ribonucleoprotein complexes, and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Many autoantigens in lupus are, at least transiently, components of the nucleolus. Considering these effects of viruses, the “X chromosome–nucleolus nexus” hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","Considering these effects of viruses, the “X chromosome–nucleolus nexus” hypothesis, which proposed disruption of the inactive X by the nucleolus during stress, is now expanded here to propose subsequent disruption of the nucleolus by previously sequestered Alu elements, which can fragment the nucleolus, leading to generation of autoantigens.","['Considering', 'these_effects', 'of', 'viruses', ',', 'the_“X_chromosome', '–', 'nucleolus_nexus”_hypothesis', ',', 'which', 'proposed', 'disruption', 'of', 'the_inactive_X', 'by', 'the_nucleolus', 'during', 'stress', ',', 'is', 'now', 'expanded', 'here', 'to', 'propose', 'subsequent_disruption', 'of', 'the_nucleolus', 'by', 'previously_sequestered_Alu_elements', ',', 'which', 'can', 'fragment', 'the_nucleolus', ',', 'leading', 'to', 'generation', 'of', 'autoantigens', '.']","Considering these_effects of viruses , the_“X_chromosome – nucleolus_nexus”_hypothesis , which proposed disruption of the_inactive_X by the_nucleolus during stress , is now expanded here to propose subsequent_disruption of the_nucleolus by previously_sequestered_Alu_elements , which can fragment the_nucleolus , leading to generation of autoantigens .","['these_effects', 'viruses', 'nucleolus_nexus”_hypothesis', 'disruption', 'the_inactive_X', 'the_nucleolus', 'stress', 'subsequent_disruption', 'the_nucleolus', 'previously_sequestered_Alu_elements', 'the_nucleolus', 'generation', 'autoantigens']"

The characterization of the responses of target cells to ZEBOV infection may therefore not only further understanding of pathogenesis but also suggest possible points of therapeutic intervention. Gene expression profiles of primary human macrophages exposed to ZEBOV were determined using DNA microarrays and quantitative PCR to gain insight into the cellular response immediately after cell entry. Significant changes in mRNA concentrations encoding for 88 cellular proteins were observed. Most of these proteins have not yet been implicated in ZEBOV infection. Some, however, are inflammatory mediators known to be elevated during the acute phase of disease in the blood of ZEBOV-infected humans. Interestingly, the cellular response occurred within the first hour of Ebola virion exposure, i.e. prior to virus gene expression. This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response. Indeed, ZEBOV virions, LPS, and virus-like particles consisting of only the ZEBOV matrix protein VP40 and GP(1,2) (VLP(VP40-GP)) triggered comparable responses in macrophages, including pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic signals. In contrast, VLP(VP40) (particles lacking GP(1,2)) caused an aberrant response. This suggests that GP(1,2) binding to macrophages plays an important role in the immediate cellular response.","This observation supports the hypothesis that virion binding or entry mediated by the spike glycoprotein (GP(1,2)) is the primary stimulus for an initial response.","['This_observation', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'virion_binding', 'or', 'entry', 'mediated', 'by', 'the_spike_glycoprotein', '(', 'GP(1,2', ')', ')', 'is', 'the_primary_stimulus', 'for', 'an_initial_response', '.']","This_observation supports the_hypothesis that virion_binding or entry mediated by the_spike_glycoprotein ( GP(1,2 ) ) is the_primary_stimulus for an_initial_response .","['This_observation', 'the_hypothesis', 'virion_binding', 'entry', 'the_spike_glycoprotein', '( GP(1,2', 'the_primary_stimulus', 'an_initial_response']"
"Abstract Background and aims Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. The complement system is involved in atherogenesis, and the complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role facilitating the clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. Limited evidence suggests that CR1 may be involved in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the relationship between CR1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk. Methods Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region (n = 73) on chromosome 1 were assessed in 5244 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age, country and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease. Results All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. In this region, strong LD was present leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (all p < 0.05). Moreover, most of the associated SNPs were also associated with levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected. Conclusions These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated with inflammation and the risk of incident coronary artery disease.","The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected.","['The_global_p-value', 'for', 'the_tail_strength_method', 'to', 'control', 'for', 'multiple_testing', 'was', '0.0489', ',', 'implying', 'that', 'the_null_hypothesis', 'of', 'no_associated_SNPs', 'can', 'be', 'rejected', '.']","The_global_p-value for the_tail_strength_method to control for multiple_testing was 0.0489 , implying that the_null_hypothesis of no_associated_SNPs can be rejected .","['the_tail_strength_method', 'control', 'multiple_testing', 'the_null_hypothesis', 'no_associated_SNPs']"
BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of central nervous system that causes the removal of fatty myelin sheath from axons of the brain and spinal cord. Autoimmunity plays an important role in this pathology outcome and body's own immune system attacks on the myelin sheath causing the damage. The etiology of the disease is partially understood and the response to treatment cannot easily be predicted. RESULTS: We presented the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved. CONCLUSIONS: The presented model allows to capture the essential dynamics of relapsing-remitting MS despite its simplicity.

"Innate recognition of viruses is an essential part of the immune response to viral pathogens. This is integral to the maintenance of healthy lungs, which are free from infection and efficient at gaseous exchange. An important component of innate immunity for identifying viruses is the family of C-type collagen-containing lectins, also known as collectins. These secreted, soluble proteins are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including viral glycoproteins. These innate immune proteins are composed of trimerized units which oligomerise into higher-order structures and facilitate the clearance of viral pathogens through multiple mechanisms. Similarly, many viral surface proteins form trimeric configurations, despite not showing primary protein sequence similarities across the virus classes and families to which they belong. In this review, we discuss the role of the lung collectins, i.e., surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) in viral recognition. We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved. Recombinant versions of these innate immune proteins may have therapeutic potential in a range of infectious and inflammatory lung diseases including anti-viral therapeutics.","We focus particularly on the structural similarity and complementarity of these trimeric collectins with the trimeric viral fusion proteins with which, we hypothesise, they have elegantly co-evolved.","['We', 'focus', 'particularly', 'on', 'the_structural_similarity', 'and', 'complementarity', 'of', 'these_trimeric_collectins', 'with', 'the_trimeric_viral_fusion_proteins', 'with', 'which', ',', 'we', 'hypothesise', ',', 'they', 'have', 'elegantly', 'co', '-', 'evolved', '.']","We focus particularly on the_structural_similarity and complementarity of these_trimeric_collectins with the_trimeric_viral_fusion_proteins with which , we hypothesise , they have elegantly co - evolved .","['the_structural_similarity', 'complementarity', 'these_trimeric_collectins', 'the_trimeric_viral_fusion_proteins']"
"Infant mortality from viral infection remains a major global health concern: viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication. Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-α supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cell-mediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-α responses.","We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/TLR9, NF-κB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection.","['We', 'tested', 'this_hypothesis', 'by', 'studying', 'pDC_functions', 'in', 'vivo', 'during', 'LCMV_infection', 'and', 'identified', 'a_coordinated_downregulation', 'of', 'infant', 'pDC', 'maturation', ',', 'activation', 'and', 'function', ':', 'despite', 'an', 'adult', '-', 'like', 'in', 'vitro_activation_capacity', 'of', 'infant_pDCs', ',', 'the_expression', 'of', 'the_E2-2_pDC_master_regulator', '(', 'and', 'of', 'critical_downstream_antiviral_genes', 'such', 'as', 'MyD88', ',', 'TLR7/TLR9', ',', 'NF-κB', ',', 'IRF7', 'and', 'IRF8', ')', 'is', 'downregulated', 'in', 'vivo', 'at', 'baseline', 'and', 'during', 'LCMV_infection', '.']","We tested this_hypothesis by studying pDC_functions in vivo during LCMV_infection and identified a_coordinated_downregulation of infant pDC maturation , activation and function : despite an adult - like in vitro_activation_capacity of infant_pDCs , the_expression of the_E2-2_pDC_master_regulator ( and of critical_downstream_antiviral_genes such as MyD88 , TLR7/TLR9 , NF-κB , IRF7 and IRF8 ) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV_infection .","['this_hypothesis', 'pDC_functions', 'vivo', 'LCMV_infection', 'a_coordinated_downregulation', 'infant pDC maturation', 'activation', 'function', 'adult', 'vitro_activation_capacity', 'infant_pDCs', 'the_expression', 'the_E2-2_pDC_master_regulator', 'critical_downstream_antiviral_genes', 'MyD88', 'TLR7/TLR9', 'NF-κB', 'IRF7', 'IRF8', 'vivo', 'baseline', 'LCMV_infection']"

"The substantial winter influenza peak in temperate climates has lead to the hypothesis that cold and/or dry air is a causal factor in influenza variability. We examined the relationship between cold and/or dry air and daily influenza and pneumonia mortality in the cold season in the New York metropolitan area from 1975–2002. We conducted a retrospective study relating daily pneumonia and influenza mortality for New York City and surroundings from 1975–2002 to daily air temperature, dew point temperature (a measure of atmospheric humidity), and daily air mass type. We identified high mortality days and periods and employed temporal smoothers and lags to account for the latency period and the time between infection and death. Unpaired t-tests were used to compare high mortality events to non-events and nonparametric bootstrapped regression analysis was used to examine the characteristics of longer mortality episodes. We found a statistically significant (p = 0.003) association between periods of low dew point temperature and above normal pneumonia and influenza mortality 17 days later. The duration (r = −0.61) and severity (r = −0.56) of high mortality episodes was inversely correlated with morning dew point temperature prior to and during the episodes. Weeks in which moist polar air masses were common (air masses characterized by low dew point temperatures) were likewise followed by above normal mortality 17 days later (p = 0.019).

"OBJECTIVES: A recent update of the definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) proposed an empirical classification based on ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) at ARDS onset. Since the proposal did not mandate PaO(2)/FiO(2) calculation under standardised ventilator settings (SVS), we hypothesised that a stratification based on baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) would not provide accurate assessment of lung injury severity. DESIGN: A prospective, multicentre, observational study. SETTING: A network of teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 478 patients with eligible criteria for moderate (100<PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤200) and severe (PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100) ARDS and followed until hospital discharge. INTERVENTIONS: We examined physiological and ventilator parameters in association with the PaO(2)/FiO(2) at ARDS onset, after 24 h of usual care and at 24 h under a SVS. At 24 h, patients were reclassified as severe, moderate, mild (200<PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤300) ARDS and non-ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2)>300). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Group severity and hospital mortality. RESULTS: At ARDS onset, 173 patients had a PaO(2)/FiO(2)≤100 but only 38.7% met criteria for severe ARDS at 24 h under SVS. When assessed under SVS, 61.3% of patients with severe ARDS were reclassified as moderate, mild and non-ARDS, while lung severity and hospital mortality changed markedly with every PaO(2)/FiO(2) category (p<0.000001). Our model of risk stratification outperformed the stratification using baseline PaO(2)/FiO(2) and non-standardised PaO(2)/FiO(2) at 24 h, when analysed by the predictive receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: area under the ROC curve for stratification at baseline was 0.583 (95% CI 0.525 to 0.636), 0.605 (95% CI 0.552 to 0.658) at 24 h without SVS and 0.693 (95% CI 0.645 to 0.742) at 24 h under SVS (p<0.000001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the need for patient assessment under SVS at 24 h after ARDS onset to assess disease severity, and have implications for the diagnosis and management of ARDS patients.

"PURPOSE. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is among the most efficient nonviral gene delivery vectors. Its efficiency and cytotoxicity depend on molecular weight, with the 25-kDa PEI being most efficient but cytotoxic. Smaller PEIs are noncytotoxic but less efficient. Enhancement in gene delivery efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity by cross-linking of small PEIs via potentially biodegradable linkages was explored herein. The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation’s effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity. Toward this goal, we carried out cross-linking of branched 2-kDa PEI and its 1:1 (w/w) mixture with a linear 423-Da PEI via ester- and/or amide-bearing linkages; the in vitro and in vivo gene delivery efficiency, as well as toxicity to mammalian cells, of the resultant cross-linked polycations were investigated. METHODS. The efficiency of the cross-linked PEIs in delivering in vitro a plasmid containing β-galactosidase gene and their cytotoxicity were investigated in monkey kidney cells (COS-7). Dynamic light scattering was used to compare the relative DNA condensation efficiency of the unmodified and cross-linked PEIs. In vivo gene delivery efficiency was evaluated by intratracheal delivery in mice of the complexes of a luciferase-encoding plasmid and the PEIs and estimating the luciferase expression in the lungs. RESULTS. Cross-linking boosted the gene delivery efficiency of the small PEIs by 40- to 550-fold in vitro; the efficiency of the most potent conjugates even exceeded by an order of magnitude that of the branched 25-kDa PEI. Effective condensation of DNA was evident from the fact that the mean diameter of the complexes of the cross-linked PEIs was some 300 nm with a narrow size distribution, while the complexes of the unmodified small PEIs exhibited a mean size of >700 nm with a very broad size distribution. At concentrations where the 25-kDa PEI resulted in >95% cell death, the conjugates afforded nearly full cell viability. The cross-linked PEIs were 17 to 80 times m ore efficient than the unmodified ones in vivo; furthermore, their efficiencies were up to twice that of the 25-kDa PEI. CONCLUSIONS. Cross-linking of small PEIs with judiciously designed amide- and ester-bearing linkers boosts their gene delivery efficiency both in vitro and in vivo without increasing the cytotoxicity. The high efficiency is dependent on the nature of the linkages and the PEIs used.","The hypothesis was that cross-linking would raise the polycation’s effective molecular weight and hence the transfection efficiency, while biodegradable linkages would undergo the intracellular breakdown after DNA delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity.","['The_hypothesis', 'was', 'that', 'cross', '-', 'linking', 'would', 'raise', 'the_polycation', '’s', 'effective_molecular_weight', 'and', 'hence_the_transfection_efficiency', ',', 'while', 'biodegradable_linkages', 'would', 'undergo', 'the_intracellular_breakdown', 'after', 'DNA_delivery', 'and', 'hence', 'not', 'lead', 'to', 'cytotoxicity', '.']","The_hypothesis was that cross - linking would raise the_polycation ’s effective_molecular_weight and hence_the_transfection_efficiency , while biodegradable_linkages would undergo the_intracellular_breakdown after DNA_delivery and hence not lead to cytotoxicity .","['The_hypothesis', 'cross', 'the_polycation', 'hence_the_transfection_efficiency', 'biodegradable_linkages', 'DNA_delivery', 'cytotoxicity']"
"Chlamydiae may exist at the site of infection in an alternative replicative form, called the aberrant body (AB). ABs are produced during a viable but non-infectious developmental state termed “persistence” or “chlamydial stress.” As persistent/stressed chlamydiae: (i) may contribute to chronic inflammation observed in diseases like trachoma; and (ii) are more resistant to current anti-chlamydial drugs of choice, it is critical to better understand this developmental stage. We previously demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) co-infection induced Chlamydia pecorum persistence/stress in culture. One critical characteristic of persistence/stress is that the chlamydiae remain viable and can reenter the normal developmental cycle when the stressor is removed. Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited. Therefore, we performed time course experiments in which Vero cells were C. pecorum/PEDV infected in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), which inhibits viral but not chlamydial protein synthesis. CHX-exposure inhibited PEDV replication, but did not inhibit induction of C. pecorum persistence at 24 h post-PEDV infection, as indicated by AB formation and reduced production of infectious EBs. Interestingly, production of infectious EBs resumed when CHX-exposed, co-infected cells were incubated 48–72 h post-PEDV co-infection. These data demonstrate that PEDV co-infection-induced chlamydial persistence/stress is reversible and suggest that this induction (i) does not require viral replication in host cells; and (ii) does not require de novo host or viral protein synthesis. These data also suggest that viral binding and/or entry may be required for this effect. Because the PEDV host cell receptor (CD13 or aminopeptidase N) stimulates cellular signaling pathways in the absence of PEDV infection, we suspect that PEDV co-infection might alter CD13 function and induce the chlamydiae to enter the persistent state.","Thus, we hypothesized that PEDV-induced persistence would be reversible if viral replication was inhibited.","['Thus', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'PEDV-induced_persistence', 'would', 'be', 'reversible', 'if', 'viral_replication', 'was', 'inhibited', '.']","Thus , we hypothesized that PEDV-induced_persistence would be reversible if viral_replication was inhibited .","['PEDV-induced_persistence', 'viral_replication']"
"Rabies remains a major public health concern in many developing countries. The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction. Mice that received intranasal inoculation of an attenuated rabies virus (RABV) strain HEP-Flury exhibited subtle clinical signs, and eventually recovered, which is different from the fatal encephalitis caused by the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. To understand the neuropathogenesis of rabies and the mechanisms of viral clearance, we applied RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to compare the brain transcriptomes of normal mice vs. HEP-Flury or CVS-11 intranasally inoculated mice. Our results revealed that both RABV strains altered positively and negatively the expression levels of many host genes, including genes associated with innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation and cell death. It is found that HEP-Flury infection can activate the innate immunity earlier through the RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, and the innate immunity pre-activated by HEP-Flury or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection can effectively prevent the CVS-11 to invade central nervous system (CNS), but fails to clear the CVS-11 after its entry into the CNS. In addition, following CVS-11 infection, genes implicated in cell adhesion, blood vessel morphogenesis and coagulation were mainly up-regulated, while the genes involved in synaptic transmission and ion transport were significantly down-regulated. On the other hand, several genes involved in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation pathway were activated to a greater extent after the HEP-Flury infection as compared with the CVS-11 infection suggesting that the collaboration of CD4(+) T cells and MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation is critical for the clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS. The differentially regulated genes reported here are likely to include potential therapeutic targets for expanding the post-exposure treatment window for RABV infection.","The precise neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown, though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal death or dysfunction.","['The_precise_neuropathogenesis', 'of', 'rabies', 'is', 'unknown', ',', 'though', 'it', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'be', 'due', 'to', 'neuronal_death', 'or', 'dysfunction', '.']","The_precise_neuropathogenesis of rabies is unknown , though it is hypothesized to be due to neuronal_death or dysfunction .","['The_precise_neuropathogenesis', 'rabies', 'neuronal_death', 'dysfunction']"

"BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. While miRNAs are increasingly recognized for their roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in animals and plants, miRNAs in fungi were less well studied and their potential roles in fungal dimorphism were largely unknown. Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput sequencing technology. Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P<0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1(KO), dcl-2(KO), dcl(DKO) and qde-2(KO) deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 (KD), supporting regulatory function of milRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provided the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.","Based on P. marneffei genome sequence, we hypothesize that miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) may be expressed in the dimorphic fungus.","['Based', 'on', 'P._marneffei_genome_sequence', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'miRNA', '-like_RNAs', '(', 'milRNAs', ')', 'may', 'be', 'expressed', 'in', 'the_dimorphic_fungus', '.']","Based on P._marneffei_genome_sequence , we hypothesize that miRNA -like_RNAs ( milRNAs ) may be expressed in the_dimorphic_fungus .","['P._marneffei_genome_sequence', 'miRNA', '( milRNAs', 'the_dimorphic_fungus']"
"Abstract One of the great challenges in the ecology of infectious diseases is to understand what drives the emergence of new pathogens including the relationship between viruses and their hosts. In the case of the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), several studies have shown coronavirus diversity in bats as well as the existence of SARS-CoV infection in apparently healthy bats, suggesting that bats may be a crucial host in the genesis of this disease. To elucidate the biogeographic origin of SARS-CoV and investigate the role that bats played in its emergence, we amplified coronavirus sequences from bat species captured throughout Thailand and assessed the phylogenetic relationships to each other and to other published coronavirus sequences. To this end, RdRp sequence of Coronavirinae was targeted by RT-PCR in non-invasive samples from bats collected in Thailand. Two new coronaviruses were detected in two bat species: one Betacoronavirus in Hipposideros larvatus and one Alphacoronavirus in Hipposideros armiger. Interestingly, these viruses from South-East Asia are related to those previously detected in Africa (Betacoronavirus-b) or in Europe (Alphacoronavirus & Betacoronavirus-b). These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human. All reported Betacoronaviruses-b (SARS-CoV group) of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae respectively cluster in two groups despite their broad geographic distribution and the sympatry of their hosts, which is in favor of an ancient and genetically independent evolution of Betacoronavirus-b clusters in these families. Moreover, despite its probable pathogenicity, we found that a Betacoronavirus-b can persistently infect a medium-sized hipposiderid bat colony. These findings illustrate the importance of the host phylogeny and the host/pathogen ecological interactions in the description and the understanding of pathogen emergence. The host’s phylogeny, biogeography and behaviour, combined with already described roles of pathogen plasticity and anthropic changes are likely to be co-factors of disease emergence. Elucidating the common ancestor of Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae is key to understanding the evolutionary history of actual betacoronaviruses and therefore to get an insight of the deep origin of SARS-CoV.",These findings illuminate the origin and the evolutionary history of the SARS-CoV group found in bats by pushing forward the hypothesis of a Betacoronavirus spill-over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human.,"['These_findings', 'illuminate', 'the_origin', 'and', 'the_evolutionary_history', 'of', 'the_SARS-CoV_group', 'found', 'in', 'bats', 'by', 'pushing', 'forward', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'a_Betacoronavirus_spill', '-', 'over', 'from', 'Hipposideridae', 'to', 'Rhinolophidae', 'and', 'then', 'from', 'Rhinolophidae', 'to', 'civets', 'and', 'Human', '.']",These_findings illuminate the_origin and the_evolutionary_history of the_SARS-CoV_group found in bats by pushing forward the_hypothesis of a_Betacoronavirus_spill - over from Hipposideridae to Rhinolophidae and then from Rhinolophidae to civets and Human .,"['These_findings', 'the_origin', 'the_evolutionary_history', 'the_SARS-CoV_group', 'bats', 'the_hypothesis', 'a_Betacoronavirus_spill', 'Hipposideridae', 'Rhinolophidae', 'Rhinolophidae', 'civets', 'Human']"
"BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) zanamivir could be a suitable alternative for the treatment of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in patients who are unable to take oral or inhaled medication, for example, those on mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017–2018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score > 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10–17). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: IV zanamivir could be a good therapeutic option in patients with severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who are unable to take oral or aerosolised antiviral medication.

"Trafficking and inflammation in airway diseases are, in part, modulated by members of the CC chemokine family, eotaxin-1 (CCL11), eotaxin-2 (CCL24), and eotaxin-3 (CCL26), which transduce signals through their CCR3 receptor. In this context, we hypothesized that transfecting alveolar type II epithelial cells with CCR3-targeted siRNA or antisense (AS-ODN) sequences will downregulate cellular synthesis and release of the primary CCR3 ligands CCL26 and CCL24 and will modulate other CCR3 ligands. The human A549 alveolar type II epithelium-like cell culture model was used for transfection and subsequent effects on CCR3 agonists. siRNAs were particularly effective. PCR showed a 60-80% decrease in mRNA and immunoblots showed up to 75-84% reduction of CCR3 in siRNA treated cells. CCR3-siRNA treatments reduced IL-4 stimulated CCL26 release and constitutive CCL24 release by 65% and 80%, respectively. Release of four additional CCR3 agonists RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3 and MCP-4 was also significantly reduced by CCR3-siRNA treatments of the alveolar type II cells. Activation of eosinophils, assessed as superoxide anion generation, was reduced when eosinophils were treated with supernatants of A549 cells pretreated with CCR3-targeted siRNAs or AS-ODNs. Collectively, the data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of CCR3 receptors may be a potential therapeutic approach for interrupting proinflammatory signaling.","In this context, we hypothesized that transfecting alveolar type II epithelial cells with CCR3-targeted siRNA or antisense (AS-ODN) sequences will downregulate cellular synthesis and release of the primary CCR3 ligands CCL26 and CCL24 and will modulate other CCR3 ligands.","['In', 'this_context', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'transfecting', 'alveolar_type_II_epithelial_cells', 'with', 'CCR3-targeted', 'siRNA', 'or', 'antisense', '(', 'AS', '-', 'ODN', ')', 'sequences', 'will', 'downregulate', 'cellular_synthesis', 'and', 'release', 'of', 'the_primary_CCR3_ligands', 'CCL26', 'and', 'CCL24', 'and', 'will', 'modulate', 'other_CCR3_ligands', '.']","In this_context , we hypothesized that transfecting alveolar_type_II_epithelial_cells with CCR3-targeted siRNA or antisense ( AS - ODN ) sequences will downregulate cellular_synthesis and release of the_primary_CCR3_ligands CCL26 and CCL24 and will modulate other_CCR3_ligands .","['this_context', 'alveolar_type_II_epithelial_cells', 'CCR3-targeted siRNA', 'or antisense', '( AS - ODN ) sequences', 'cellular_synthesis', 'release', 'the_primary_CCR3_ligands', 'CCL24', 'other_CCR3_ligands']"

"In order to investigate the mechanisms of persistent foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in cattle, transcriptome alterations associated with the FMDV carrier state were characterized using a bovine whole-transcriptome microarray. Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinant FMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A(24) Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers were further compared to 2 naïve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers. Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response–such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells–were significantly overrepresented. Differential gene expression was significantly correlated between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (biological correlation +0.97), indicating a similar transcriptome profile across these groups. Genes related to prostaglandin E(2) production and the induction of regulatory T cells were overexpressed in carriers. In contrast, tissues from non-carrier animals expressed higher levels of complement regulators and pro-apoptotic genes that could promote virus clearance. Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis for FMDV persistence in nasopharyngeal tissues of cattle, in which the virus may be maintained by an impairment of apoptosis and the local suppression of cell-mediated antiviral immunity by inducible regulatory T cells.","Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis for FMDV persistence in nasopharyngeal tissues of cattle, in which the virus may be maintained by an impairment of apoptosis and the local suppression of cell-mediated antiviral immunity by inducible regulatory T cells.","['Based', 'on', 'these_findings', ',', 'we', 'propose', 'a_working_hypothesis', 'for', 'FMDV_persistence', 'in', 'nasopharyngeal_tissues', 'of', 'cattle', ',', 'in', 'which', 'the_virus', 'may', 'be', 'maintained', 'by', 'an_impairment', 'of', 'apoptosis', 'and', 'the_local_suppression', 'of', 'cell-mediated_antiviral_immunity', 'by', 'inducible_regulatory_T_cells', '.']","Based on these_findings , we propose a_working_hypothesis for FMDV_persistence in nasopharyngeal_tissues of cattle , in which the_virus may be maintained by an_impairment of apoptosis and the_local_suppression of cell-mediated_antiviral_immunity by inducible_regulatory_T_cells .","['these_findings', 'a_working_hypothesis', 'FMDV_persistence', 'nasopharyngeal_tissues', 'cattle', 'the_virus', 'an_impairment', 'apoptosis', 'the_local_suppression', 'cell-mediated_antiviral_immunity', 'inducible_regulatory_T_cells']"
"Methods for translating gene expression signatures into clinically relevant information have typically relied upon having many samples from patients with similar molecular phenotypes. Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-of-a-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machine-learning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public expression data sets, reformulated to create a test bed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading methods, and show that CSAX aids in both identifying anomalies and explaining their underlying biology. We describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks. We then illustrate CSAX's value in two developmental case studies. Confirming prior hypotheses, CSAX highlights disruption of platelet activation pathways in a neonate with retinopathy of prematurity and identifies, for the first time, dysregulated oxidative stress response in second trimester amniotic fluid of fetuses with obese mothers.

"We aimed to test the hypothesis that gene silencing of tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) may attenuate lesion inflammation and positive vascular remodeling and enhance plaque stability in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis. Lentivirus-mediated TACE shRNA was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques of rabbits which effectively down-regulated TACE expression and activities from week 8 to week 16. TACE gene silencing reduced remodeling index and plaque burden, and diminished the content of macrophages and lipids while increased that of smooth muscle cells and collagen in the aortic plaques. In addition, TACE gene silencing attenuated the local expression of P65, iNOS, ICAM-1, VEGF and Flt-1 and activities of MMP9 and MMP2 while increased the local expression of TGF-β1 together with reduced number of neovessels in the aorta. TACE shRNA treatment resulted in down-regulated expression of TACE in macrophages and blunted ERK-P38 phosphorylation and tube formation of co-cultured mouse vascular smooth muscle cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In conclusion, gene silencing of TACE enhanced plaque stability and improved vascular positive remodeling. The mechanisms may involve attenuated local inflammation, neovascularization and MMP activation, as well as enhanced collagen production probably via down-regulated ERK-NF-κB and up-regulated TGF-β1 signaling pathways.",We aimed to test the hypothesis that gene silencing of tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE) may attenuate lesion inflammation and positive vascular remodeling and enhance plaque stability in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis.,"['We', 'aimed', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'gene', 'silencing', 'of', 'tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha_converting_enzyme', '(', 'TACE', ')', 'may', 'attenuate', 'lesion_inflammation', 'and', 'positive_vascular_remodeling', 'and', 'enhance', 'plaque_stability', 'in', 'a_rabbit_model', 'of', 'atherosclerosis', '.']",We aimed to test the_hypothesis that gene silencing of tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha_converting_enzyme ( TACE ) may attenuate lesion_inflammation and positive_vascular_remodeling and enhance plaque_stability in a_rabbit_model of atherosclerosis .,"['the_hypothesis', 'gene', 'tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha_converting_enzyme', '( TACE', 'lesion_inflammation', 'positive_vascular_remodeling', 'plaque_stability', 'a_rabbit_model', 'atherosclerosis']"
"One hypothesis for the etiology of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease is that infection by a virus sharing antigenic epitopes with CNS antigens (molecular mimicry) elicits a virus-specific immune response that also recognizes self-epitopes. To address this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated that express the nucleoprotein or glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as self in oligodendrocytes. Intraperitoneal infection with LCMV strain Armstrong led to infection of tissues in the periphery but not the CNS, and the virus was cleared within 7–14 d. After clearance, a chronic inflammation of the CNS resulted, accompanied by upregulation of CNS expression of MHC class I and II molecules. A second LCMV infection led to enhanced CNS pathology, characterized by loss of myelin and clinical motor dysfunction. Disease enhancement also occurred after a second infection with unrelated viruses that cross-activated LCMV-specific memory T cells. These findings indicate that chronic CNS autoimmune disease may be induced by infection with a virus sharing epitopes with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and this disease may be enhanced by a second infection with the same or an unrelated virus. These results may explain the association of several different viruses with some human autoimmune diseases.",One hypothesis for the etiology of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease is that infection by a virus sharing antigenic epitopes with CNS antigens (molecular mimicry) elicits a virus-specific immune response that also recognizes self-epitopes.,"['One_hypothesis', 'for', 'the_etiology', 'of', 'central_nervous_system_(CNS)_autoimmune_disease', 'is', 'that', 'infection', 'by', 'a_virus', 'sharing', 'antigenic_epitopes', 'with', 'CNS_antigens', '(', 'molecular_mimicry', ')', 'elicits', 'a_virus-specific_immune_response', 'that', 'also', 'recognizes', 'self-epitopes', '.']",One_hypothesis for the_etiology of central_nervous_system_(CNS)_autoimmune_disease is that infection by a_virus sharing antigenic_epitopes with CNS_antigens ( molecular_mimicry ) elicits a_virus-specific_immune_response that also recognizes self-epitopes .,"['One_hypothesis', 'the_etiology', 'central_nervous_system_(CNS)_autoimmune_disease', 'that infection', 'a_virus', 'antigenic_epitopes', 'CNS_antigens', '( molecular_mimicry', 'a_virus-specific_immune_response', 'self-epitopes']"
"Predicting RNA secondary structure is often the first step to determining the structure of RNA. Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5′ to 3′ folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.",The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5′ to 3′ folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model.,"['The_heuristic_approach', 'takes', 'advantage', 'of', 'the_5′', 'to', '3′_folding_direction', 'of', 'many_biological_RNA_molecules', 'and', 'is', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_hierarchical_folding_hypothesis', 'and', 'the_contact_order_model', '.']",The_heuristic_approach takes advantage of the_5′ to 3′_folding_direction of many_biological_RNA_molecules and is consistent with the_hierarchical_folding_hypothesis and the_contact_order_model .,"['The_heuristic_approach', 'advantage', 'the_5′', 'many_biological_RNA_molecules', 'the_hierarchical_folding_hypothesis', 'the_contact_order_model']"
"Coronaviruses (CoV) comprise a large group of emerging human and animal pathogens, including the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) strains. The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus–host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control. Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis. In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model. By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.","More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis.","['More', 'recently', ',', 'a_growing_body', 'of', 'evidence', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'viruses', ',_even_lytic_RNA_viruses', 'that', 'replicate', 'in', 'the_cytoplasm', ',', 'have', 'developed', 'intricate,_highly_evolved,_and_well-coordinated_processes', 'that', 'are', 'designed', 'to', 'regulate', 'the_host_epigenome', ',', 'and', 'control_host', 'innate', 'immune_antiviral_defense_processes', ',', 'thereby', 'promoting', 'robust_virus_replication', 'and', 'pathogenesis', '.']","More recently , a_growing_body of evidence supports the_hypothesis that viruses ,_even_lytic_RNA_viruses that replicate in the_cytoplasm , have developed intricate,_highly_evolved,_and_well-coordinated_processes that are designed to regulate the_host_epigenome , and control_host innate immune_antiviral_defense_processes , thereby promoting robust_virus_replication and pathogenesis .","['a_growing_body', 'evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'that viruses', '_even_lytic_RNA_viruses', 'the_cytoplasm', 'intricate,_highly_evolved,_and_well-coordinated_processes', 'the_host_epigenome', 'immune_antiviral_defense_processes', 'robust_virus_replication', 'pathogenesis']"
"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by infectious insults, such as pneumonia from various pathogens or related to other noninfectious events. Clinical and histopathologic characteristics are similar across severely affected patients, suggesting that a common mode of immune reaction may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of ARDS. There may be etiologic substances that have an affinity for respiratory cells and induce lung cell injury in cases of ARDS. These substances originate not only from pathogens, but also from injured host cells. At the molecular level, these substances have various sizes and biochemical characteristics, classifying them as protein substances and non-protein substances. Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis). The severity or chronicity of ARDS depends on the amount of etiologic substances with corresponding immune reactions, the duration of the appearance of specific immune cells, or the repertoire of specific immune cells that control the substances. Therefore, treatment with early systemic immune modulators (corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin) as soon as possible may reduce aberrant immune responses in the potential stage of ARDS.","Immune cells and immune proteins may recognize and act on these substances, including pathogenic proteins and peptides, depending upon the size and biochemical properties of the substances (this theory is known as the protein-homeostasis-system hypothesis).","['Immune_cells', 'and', 'immune_proteins', 'may', 'recognize', 'and', 'act', 'on', 'these_substances', ',', 'including', 'pathogenic_proteins', 'and', 'peptides', ',', 'depending', 'upon', 'the_size', 'and', 'biochemical_properties', 'of', 'the_substances', '(', 'this_theory', 'is', 'known', 'as', 'the_protein-homeostasis-system_hypothesis', ')', '.']","Immune_cells and immune_proteins may recognize and act on these_substances , including pathogenic_proteins and peptides , depending upon the_size and biochemical_properties of the_substances ( this_theory is known as the_protein-homeostasis-system_hypothesis ) .","['Immune_cells', 'immune_proteins', 'these_substances', 'pathogenic_proteins', 'peptides', 'the_size', 'biochemical_properties', 'the_substances', 'this_theory', 'the_protein-homeostasis-system_hypothesis']"
"ABSTRACT Neonatal diarrhea remains the primary cause of mortality in dairy calves around the world, and optimal treatment protocols are needed. The main goals of therapy are to restore hydration and electrolyte concentrations, correct strong ion (metabolic) acidemia, and provide nutritional support. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions (OES) has long been the primary method used to treat neonatal diarrhea in humans and calves because OES are capable of addressing each of the primary goals of therapy. In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to compare the ability of a commercially available oral electrolyte solution (OES) administered alone or in combination with hypertonic saline with small volumes of IV or SC fluid therapy to resuscitate calves with diarrhea. Thirty-three Holstein calves from 5 to 14 d of age were utilized in this clinical trial. Diarrhea and dehydration were induced by adding sucrose to the milk replacer. In addition, hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone were given orally and furosemide intramuscularly. Depression status, clinical hydration scores, fecal consistency, and body weight were recorded at regular intervals. Treatment began when calves had severe diarrhea and had a decrease in plasma volume of at least 10%. Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups of 8 to 9 calves per group: (1) OES; (2) OES with hypertonic saline (4 mL/kg, IV); (3) IV fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L); or (4) SC fluids (lactated Ringer's, 2 L). Treatments were given at 0 and 12 h. Changes in plasma volume, blood pH, electrolyte levels, and physical examination scores were determined before therapy and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after each treatment. All 4 treatments were ultimately successful in improving hydration as well as increasing blood pH; however, animals in both groups that received OES had much faster resuscitation than those in either the IV or SC fluid group. In conclusion, oral electrolyte products remain the gold standard for resuscitating diarrheic calves with moderate dehydration and acidemia and will likely perform better than small volumes of IV lactated Ringer's solution. Subcutaneous fluids by themselves are a poor treatment option and should be only be used as supportive therapy following the initial correction of hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis.","In calves with moderate dehydration, we hypothesized that oral electrolytes would be as good as or better than small volumes of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) fluids.","['In', 'calves', 'with', 'moderate_dehydration', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'oral_electrolytes', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'as', 'or', 'better', 'than', 'small_volumes', 'of', 'intravenous', '(', 'IV', ')', 'or', 'subcutaneous', '(', 'SC', ')', 'fluids', '.']","In calves with moderate_dehydration , we hypothesized that oral_electrolytes would be as good as or better than small_volumes of intravenous ( IV ) or subcutaneous ( SC ) fluids .","['calves', 'moderate_dehydration', 'oral_electrolytes', 'small_volumes', 'intravenous ( IV', 'SC']"
"Mammals evolved in a microbial world, and consequently, microbial symbionts have played a role in their evolution. An exciting new subdiscipline of metagenomics considers the ways in which microbes, particularly those found in the gut, have facilitated the ecological and phylogenetic radiation of mammals. However, the vast majority of such studies focus on domestic animals, laboratory models, or charismatic megafauna (e.g., pandas and chimpanzees). The result is a plethora of studies covering few taxa across the mammal tree of life, leaving broad patterns of microbiome function and evolution unclear. Wildlife microbiome research urgently needs a model system in which to test hypotheses about metagenomic involvement in host ecology and evolution.

However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), were largely limited to this group.

"There has been significant progress in our knowledge about the relationship between infectious disease and the immune system in relation to asthma, but many unanswered questions still remain. Respiratory tract infections such as those caused by respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus during the first two years of life are still clearly associated with later wheezing and asthma, but the mechanism has not been completely worked out. Is there an ‘infectious march’ triggered by infection in infancy that progresses to disease pathology or are infants who contract respiratory infections predisposed to developing asthma? This review focuses on the common themes in the interaction between microbes and the immune system and presents a critical appraisal of the evidence to date. The various mechanisms whereby microbes alter the immune response and how this might influence asthma are discussed along with new and promising clinical practices for prevention and therapy. Recent advances in utilizing sensitive PCR detection methods have allowed more rigorous testing of the causality hypothesis of virus infection leading to asthma, but the evidence is still equivocal. Various exceptions and inconsistencies in the clinical trials are discussed in light of new guidelines for subject inclusion/exclusion in hopes of providing some standardization. In spite of past failures in vaccination and disappointing results of some clinical trials, the new strategies for prophylaxis including RNA interference and targeted delivery of microbicides offer a large dose of hope to a world suffering from an increasing incidence of asthma and a huge burden of healthcare cost and loss of quality of life.","Recent advances in utilizing sensitive PCR detection methods have allowed more rigorous testing of the causality hypothesis of virus infection leading to asthma, but the evidence is still equivocal.","['Recent_advances', 'in', 'utilizing', 'sensitive_PCR_detection_methods', 'have', 'allowed', 'more_rigorous_testing', 'of', 'the_causality_hypothesis', 'of', 'virus_infection', 'leading', 'to', 'asthma', ',', 'but', 'the_evidence', 'is', 'still', 'equivocal', '.']","Recent_advances in utilizing sensitive_PCR_detection_methods have allowed more_rigorous_testing of the_causality_hypothesis of virus_infection leading to asthma , but the_evidence is still equivocal .","['Recent_advances', 'sensitive_PCR_detection_methods', 'more_rigorous_testing', 'the_causality_hypothesis', 'virus_infection', 'asthma', 'the_evidence']"
"BACKGROUND: SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS, and extensive investigations indicated that it originated from an animal source (probably bats) and was recently introduced into the human population via wildlife animals from wet markets in southern China. Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. RESULTS: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified. CONCLUSION: This extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the stepwise evolution of different functional proteins of SARS-CoVs at different epidemic stages and different hosts. These results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the spill over into civets and humans were more recent events.",These results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the spill over into civets and humans were more recent events.,"['These_results', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'SARS-CoV', 'originated', 'from', 'bats', 'and', 'that', 'the_spill', 'over', 'into', 'civets', 'and', 'humans', 'were', 'more_recent_events', '.']",These_results support the_hypothesis that SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the_spill over into civets and humans were more_recent_events .,"['These_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'SARS-CoV', 'bats', 'the_spill', 'civets', 'humans', 'more_recent_events']"
"The alveolar epithelium serves as a barrier to the entry of potential respiratory pathogens. Alveolar Type II (TII) cells have immunomodulatory functions, but whether Type I (TI) cells, which comprise approximately 95% of the alveolar epithelium, also play a role in immunity is unknown. Because the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS. Alveolar TI cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat lungs that had been injured with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. PCR was performed to determine whether TI cells expressed transcripts for TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β at baseline and after lung injury. Immunocytochemical and protein analysis detected angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACE2, as well as angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Type 2 receptor (AT2R), in TI cells. To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response. Primary TI cells produce cytokines when treated with LPS, contain important components of the RAS, and can modulate LPS-induced cytokine production via the RAS, suggesting a role for TI cells in the innate immune response of the lung.","Because the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS.","['Because', 'the_renin', '–', 'angiotensin_system', '(', 'RAS', ')', 'is', 'emerging', 'as', 'an_important_mediator', 'of', 'inflammation', ',', 'and', 'angiotensin-converting_enzyme', '2', '(', 'ACE2', ')', ',', 'an_element', 'of', 'the_RAS', ',', 'has', 'been', 'implicated', 'in', 'lung_injury', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'TI_cells', 'can', 'produce', 'cytokines', 'in', 'response', 'to', 'LPS_stimulation', ',', 'and', 'that', 'this_inflammation', 'can', 'be', 'modulated', 'by', 'the_RAS', '.']","Because the_renin – angiotensin_system ( RAS ) is emerging as an_important_mediator of inflammation , and angiotensin-converting_enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) , an_element of the_RAS , has been implicated in lung_injury , we hypothesize that TI_cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS_stimulation , and that this_inflammation can be modulated by the_RAS .","['the_renin', 'angiotensin_system', 'RAS', 'an_important_mediator', 'inflammation', 'angiotensin-converting_enzyme', '( ACE2', 'an_element', 'the_RAS', 'lung_injury', 'TI_cells', 'cytokines', 'response', 'LPS_stimulation', 'this_inflammation']"
"This study analyzed a heterologous prime-boost vaccine approach against HIV-1 using three different antigenically unrelated negative-stranded viruses (NSV) expressing HIV-1 Gag as vaccine vectors: rabies virus (RABV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen. To this end, we primed BALB/c mice with each of the NSV-based vectors. Primed mice were rested for thirty-five days after which we administered a second immunization with the same or heterologous NSV-Gag viruses. The magnitude and quality of the Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells in response to these vectors post boost were measured. In addition, we performed challenge experiments using vaccinia virus expressing HIV-1 Gag (VV-Gag) thirty-three days after the boost inoculation. Our results showed that the choice of the vaccine used for priming was important for the detected Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell recall responses post boost and that NDV-Gag appeared to result in a more robust recall of CD8(+) T cell responses independent of the prime vaccine used. However, the different prime-boost strategies were not distinct for the parameters studied in the challenge experiments using VV-Gag but did indicate some benefits compared to single immunizations. Taken together, our data show that NSV vectors can individually stimulate HIV-Gag specific CD8(+) T cells that are effectively recalled by other NSV vectors in a heterologous prime-boost approach. These results provide evidence that RABV, VSV and NDV can be used in combination to develop vaccines needing prime-boost regimens to stimulate effective immune responses.",We hypothesized that this approach would result in more robust cellular immune responses than those achieved with the use of any of the vaccines alone in a homologous prime-boost regimen.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'this_approach', 'would', 'result', 'in', 'more_robust_cellular_immune_responses', 'than', 'those', 'achieved', 'with', 'the_use', 'of', 'any', 'of', 'the_vaccines', 'alone', 'in', 'a_homologous_prime-boost_regimen', '.']",We hypothesized that this_approach would result in more_robust_cellular_immune_responses than those achieved with the_use of any of the_vaccines alone in a_homologous_prime-boost_regimen .,"['this_approach', 'more_robust_cellular_immune_responses', 'the_vaccines', 'a_homologous_prime-boost_regimen']"
"As a transmissible infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was successfully contained globally by instituting widespread quarantine measures. Although these measures were successful in terminating the outbreak in all areas of the world, the adverse effects of quarantine have not previously been determined in a systematic manner. In this hypothesis-generating study supported by a convenience sample drawn in close temporal proximity to the period of quarantine, we examined the psychological effects of quarantine on persons in Toronto, Canada. The 129 quarantined persons who responded to a Web-based survey exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression were observed in 28.9% and 31.2% of respondents, respectively. Longer durations of quarantine were associated with an increased prevalence of PTSD symptoms. Acquaintance with or direct exposure to someone with a diagnosis of SARS was also associated with PTSD and depressive symptoms.","In this hypothesis-generating study supported by a convenience sample drawn in close temporal proximity to the period of quarantine, we examined the psychological effects of quarantine on persons in Toronto, Canada.","['In', 'this_hypothesis-generating_study', 'supported', 'by', 'a_convenience_sample', 'drawn', 'in', 'close_temporal_proximity', 'to', 'the_period', 'of', 'quarantine', ',', 'we', 'examined', 'the_psychological_effects', 'of', 'quarantine', 'on', 'persons', 'in', 'Toronto', ',', 'Canada', '.']","In this_hypothesis-generating_study supported by a_convenience_sample drawn in close_temporal_proximity to the_period of quarantine , we examined the_psychological_effects of quarantine on persons in Toronto , Canada .","['this_hypothesis-generating_study', 'a_convenience_sample', 'close_temporal_proximity', 'the_period', 'quarantine', 'the_psychological_effects', 'quarantine', 'persons', 'Toronto', 'Canada']"
"Statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed dynamic systems is an active area of research. Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification.

"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) results from mutations in the viral genome during a common feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) infection. Since many virological and immunological data on FECV infections are lacking, the present study investigated these missing links during experimental infection of three SPF cats with FECV strain UCD. Two cats showed mild clinical signs, faecal shedding of infectious virus from 4 dpi, a cell-associated viraemia at inconsistent time points from 5 dpi, a highly neutralising antibody response from 9 dpi, and no major abnormalities in leukocyte numbers. Faecal shedding lasted for 28–56 days, but virus shed during this stage was less infectious in enterocyte cultures and affected by mutations. Remarkably, in the other cat neither clinical signs nor acute shedding were seen, but virus was detected in blood cells from 3 dpi, and shedding of non-enterotropic, mutated viruses suddenly occurred from 14 dpi onwards. Neutralising antibodies arose from 21 dpi. Leukocyte numbers were not different compared to the other cats, except for the CD8(+) regulatory T cells. These data indicate that FECV can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise.",These data indicate that FECV can infect immune cells even in the absence of intestinal replication and raise the hypothesis that the gradual adaptation to these cells can allow non-enterotropic mutants to arise.,"['These_data', 'indicate', 'that', 'FECV', 'can', 'infect', 'immune_cells', 'even', 'in', 'the_absence', 'of', 'intestinal_replication', 'and', 'raise', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_gradual_adaptation', 'to', 'these_cells', 'can', 'allow', 'non-enterotropic_mutants', 'to', 'arise', '.']",These_data indicate that FECV can infect immune_cells even in the_absence of intestinal_replication and raise the_hypothesis that the_gradual_adaptation to these_cells can allow non-enterotropic_mutants to arise .,"['These_data', 'FECV', 'immune_cells', 'intestinal_replication', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_gradual_adaptation', 'these_cells', 'non-enterotropic_mutants']"
"We tested the role of the “spring-loaded” conformational change in the fusion mechanism of the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) by assessing the effects of 10 point mutants in the region of high coiled-coil propensity, HA2 54–81. The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction (∼60– 80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion.

"Coronaviride is a colossal family of viruses that cause a variety of diseases in humans and other animals. As of late, a novel coronavirus, not anterior-optically discerned in humans, has been identified in a denizen of the Middle East. There is growing evidence that the Camelus dromedarius is host species for the virus and plays an important role of a source of human infection. Along these lines, the authors decided to detect coronaviruses in dromedary camels in two high-risk areas of Iran by employing an reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. In the present study, nasal swab specimens were collected from 98 camels (C. dromedarius) traditionally reared in southeast and northwest of Iran. The detection of pancoronavirus was carried out, using RT-PCR. Pancoronavirus RNA was observed in seven cases among 98 nasal swab samples.

"AIM: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been implicated as the etiological agent responsible for the recent outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease associated with severe neurological diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: The assembly process was hypothesized to occur via an orchestrated proteolytic processing of the P1 precursor by the viral protease 3CD. To test this hypothesis, we constructed 3 recombinant baculoviruses: Bac-P1 expressing P1; Bac-3CD expressing 3CD; and Bac-P1-3CD co-expressing P1 and 3CD. RESULTS: Both single infection by Bac-P1-3CD and co-infection by Bac-P1 and Bac-3CD resulted in correct cleavage of P1 to yield individual proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3, while the former approach yielded higher VLP production. In the cells, the structural proteins self-assembled into clusters of virus-like particles (VLP) resembling the authentic EV71 particle aggregates. After ultracentrifugation purification, the dispersed VLPs were indistinguishable from the authentic virus in size, appearance, composition and surface epitopes, as determined by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling. CONCLUSION: Our data, for the first time, suggest that in insect cells EV71 structural proteins adopt a processing and assembly pathway similar to poliovirus assembly. The preservation of particle morphology and composition suggest that the VLP may be a valuable vaccine candidate to prevent EV71 epidemics.",The assembly process was hypothesized to occur via an orchestrated proteolytic processing of the P1 precursor by the viral protease 3CD.,"['The_assembly_process', 'was', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'occur', 'via', 'an_orchestrated_proteolytic_processing', 'of', 'the_P1_precursor', 'by', 'the', 'viral', 'protease', '3CD', '.']",The_assembly_process was hypothesized to occur via an_orchestrated_proteolytic_processing of the_P1_precursor by the viral protease 3CD .,"['The_assembly_process', 'the_P1_precursor', 'protease']"
"Discovering new binding function via a combinatorial library in small protein scaffolds requires balance between appropriate mutations to introduce favorable intermolecular interactions while maintaining intramolecular integrity. Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin domain, >10(5) binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced. Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal Shannon entropies (range: 0.3–3.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1) supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and consensus biases. Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity enables direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders validating an efficient strategy to balance inter- and intra-molecular interaction demands at each site.","Inspired by this disparity between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient of amino acid diversity.","['Inspired', 'by', 'this_disparity', 'between', 'diversity_distributions', 'in', 'natural_libraries', 'and', 'synthetic_scaffold_libraries', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'binders', 'resulting', 'from', 'discovery', 'and', 'evolution', 'would', 'exhibit', 'a_non-spatial,_sitewise_gradient', 'of', 'amino_acid_diversity', '.']","Inspired by this_disparity between diversity_distributions in natural_libraries and synthetic_scaffold_libraries , we hypothesized that binders resulting from discovery and evolution would exhibit a_non-spatial,_sitewise_gradient of amino_acid_diversity .","['this_disparity', 'diversity_distributions', 'natural_libraries', 'synthetic_scaffold_libraries', 'binders', 'discovery', 'evolution', 'a_non-spatial,_sitewise_gradient', 'amino_acid_diversity']"
"Experimental evidence shows that synonymous mutations can have important consequences on genetic fitness. Many organisms display codon usage bias (CUB), where synonymous codons that are translated into the same amino acid appear with distinct frequency. Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH). Indeed, CUB indices correlate with protein expression levels, which is widely interpreted as evidence for translational selection. However, these tests neglect -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), an important translational disruption effect found across all organisms of the tree of life. Genes that contain -1 PRF signals should cost more to express than genes without. Thus, CUB indices that do not consider -1 PRF may overestimate genes’ true adaptation to translational efficiency and accuracy constraints. Here, we first investigate whether -1 PRF signals do indeed carry such translational cost. We then propose two corrections for CUB indices for genes containing -1 PRF signals. We retest the TEH in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under these corrections. We find that the correlation between corrected CUB index and protein expression remains intact for most levels of uniform -1 PRF efficiencies, and tends to increase when these efficiencies decline with protein expression. We conclude that the TEH is strengthened and that -1 PRF events constitute a promising and useful tool to examine the relationships between CUB and selection for translation efficiency and accuracy.","Within genomes, CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational efficiency and accuracy, termed the translational efficiency hypothesis (TEH).","['Within', 'genomes', ',', 'CUB', 'is', 'thought', 'to', 'arise', 'from', 'selection', 'for', 'translational_efficiency', 'and', 'accuracy', ',', 'termed', 'the_translational_efficiency_hypothesis', '(TEH', ')', '.']","Within genomes , CUB is thought to arise from selection for translational_efficiency and accuracy , termed the_translational_efficiency_hypothesis (TEH ) .","['genomes', 'CUB', 'selection', 'translational_efficiency', 'accuracy', 'the_translational_efficiency_hypothesis', 'TEH']"
"Expression of the astrovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been hypothesized to be regulated by (− 1) ribosomal frameshifting. Sequence analysis of the 70 nucleotide region between open reading frames 1a and 1b indicates the presence of a shifty heptamer consensus sequence and downstream sequences that may be needed for ribosomal frameshifting. We constructed four astrovirus cassettes that spanned this region and inserted each into the rhesus rotavirus VP4 gene. The constructs were expressed in an in vitro system, and products were immunoprecipitated by rotavirus amino and carboxy terminal-specific monoclonal antibodies. Ribosomal frameshifting, at an efficiency of 6–7%, was demonstrated in all constructs containing the shifty heptamer and stem-loop. Deletion of the downstream sequence potentially involved in pseudoknot formation did not affect frameshifting efficiency.

"Summary The magnitude of the 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic enabled an unprecedented number of viral mutations to occur over successive human-to-human transmission events, increasing the probability that adaptation to the human host occurred during the outbreak. We investigated one nonsynonymous mutation, Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) mutant A82V, for its effect on viral infectivity. This mutation, located at the NPC1-binding site on EBOV GP, occurred early in the 2013–2016 outbreak and rose to high frequency. We found that GP-A82V had heightened ability to infect primate cells, including human dendritic cells. The increased infectivity was restricted to cells that have primate-specific NPC1 sequences at the EBOV interface, suggesting that this mutation was indeed an adaptation to the human host. GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.","GP-A82V was associated with increased mortality, consistent with the hypothesis that the heightened intrinsic infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the EVD epidemic.","['GP-A82V', 'was', 'associated', 'with', 'increased_mortality', ',', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_heightened_intrinsic_infectivity', 'of', 'GP-A82V', 'contributed', 'to', 'disease', 'severity', 'during', 'the_EVD_epidemic', '.']","GP-A82V was associated with increased_mortality , consistent with the_hypothesis that the_heightened_intrinsic_infectivity of GP-A82V contributed to disease severity during the_EVD_epidemic .","['GP-A82V', 'increased_mortality', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_heightened_intrinsic_infectivity', 'GP-A82V', 'severity']"
"We tested the hypothesis that the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses for respiratory viruses would reduce antibiotic treatment and length of stay in elderly patients hospitalized with respiratory infections. Within 24 h of hospital admission, a total of 922 patients aged ≥60 years were interviewed for symptoms of ongoing respiratory tract infection. Symptomatic patients were swabbed for oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal presence of viral pathogens immediately by members of the study group. During a 2-month period, non-symptomatic volunteers among interviewed patients were swabbed as well (controls). Oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with real-time PCR for nine common respiratory viruses. A total of 147 out of 173 symptomatic patients and 56 non-symptomatic patients (controls) agreed to participate in the study. The patients were allocated to three cohorts: (1) symptomatic and PCR-positive (S/PCR+), (2) symptomatic and PCR-negative (S/PCR−), or (3) non-symptomatic and PCR-negative (control). There were no non-symptomatic patients with a positive PCR result. A non-significant difference in the frequency of empiric antibiotic administration was found when comparing the S/PCR+ to the S/PCR− cohort; 16/19 (84 %) vs. 99/128 (77 %) (χ(2) = 0.49). Antibiotic treatment was withdrawn in only two patients in the S/PCR+ cohort after receiving a positive viral diagnosis. The length of stay did not significantly differ between the S/PCR+ and the S/PCR− groups. We conclude that, at least in our general hospital setting, access to early viral diagnosis by real-time PCR had little impact on the antimicrobial treatment or length of hospitalization of elderly patients.

"The emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), nearly a decade ago with worldwide distribution, was believed to be of zoonotic origin from bats with dromedary camels as intermediate hosts. There is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus. The presence of coronaviruses, closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian bats, presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species. The possible interactions between livestock and bats in 31 household farms were accessed by observation and interviews with farmers. Rectal swabs and serum from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine from commercial and household farms were tested for MERS-CoV and a Nycteris sp. bat coronavirus, previously detected in Ghana. A pan-PCR assay to detect clade 2c viruses and recombinant immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-spike IgG antibodies against the target viruses were used. Likely contact between livestock and bats was determined for 13 farms (41.9%) that reported confining their livestock and also observing bats in their homes. Livestock were left unconfined on eight farms (25.8%) that also observed bats roosting in trees close to their homes. No viral RNA or antibodies against the two coronaviruses were detected in any of the livestock species tested. Cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine are not likely hosts of clade 2c coronaviruses.","The presence of coronaviruses, closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian bats, presented the opportunity to test the hypothesis of transmissibility of this virus through domestic livestock species.","['The_presence', 'of', 'coronaviruses', ',', 'closely', 'related', 'to', 'MERS-CoV', 'in', 'Ghanaian_bats', ',', 'presented', 'the_opportunity', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'transmissibility', 'of', 'this_virus', 'through', 'domestic_livestock_species', '.']","The_presence of coronaviruses , closely related to MERS-CoV in Ghanaian_bats , presented the_opportunity to test the_hypothesis of transmissibility of this_virus through domestic_livestock_species .","['The_presence', 'coronaviruses', 'MERS-CoV', 'Ghanaian_bats', 'the_opportunity', 'the_hypothesis', 'transmissibility', 'this_virus', 'domestic_livestock_species']"
"The polyoma BK virus (BKV) remains latent after primary infection and may reactivate during immunosuppression. The uroepithelium is the main latency site defined. This study addressed whether the gastrointestinal tract might be another latency site. To test this hypothesis, we prospectively quantified fecal BKV by quantitative PCR reaction in 40 patients undergoing hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). Urinary BKV was similarly quantified. Fecal BKV excretion was positive in 16/40 patients, of whom 10 were transient (<3 consecutively positive samples), six were persistent (⩾3 consecutively positive samples) and three were persistent with peaking (⩾10(3)-fold increase in viral load over baseline, reaching 5.11 × 10(6), 4.68 × 10(7) and 2.75 × 10(8) copies/sample at 14, 14 and 21 days post-HSCT, respectively). Urinary BKV excretion was positive in 25/40 patients. Fecal BKV excretion was significantly correlated with that of the urine (P=0.036) and was significantly associated with allogeneic HSCT (P=0.037) and persistent and peaking of urinary BKV excretion (P<0.001).

"To gain a more complete understanding of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, we initially assessed the rate at which HCV initiates productive attachment/infection in vitro and discovered it to be slower than most viruses. Since HCV, including cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc), exhibits a broad density profile (1.01 – 1.16 g/ml), we hypothesized that the varying densities of the HCVcc particles present in the inoculum may be responsible for this prolonged entry phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we show that during infection, particles of high-density disappeared from the viral inoculum sooner and initiated productive infection faster than virions of low-density. Moreover, we could alter the rate of attachment/infection initiation by increasing or decreasing the density of the cell culture medium. Together, these findings demonstrate that the relationship between the density of HCVcc and the density of the extracellular milieu can significantly impact the rate at which HCVcc productively interacts with target cells in vitro.","Since HCV, including cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc), exhibits a broad density profile (1.01 – 1.16 g/ml), we hypothesized that the varying densities of the HCVcc particles present in the inoculum may be responsible for this prolonged entry phenotype.","['Since', 'HCV', ',', 'including', 'cell_culture', '-derived_HCV', '(HCVcc', ')', ',', 'exhibits', 'a_broad_density_profile', '(', '1.01', '–', '1.16_g/ml', ')', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_varying_densities', 'of', 'the_HCVcc_particles', 'present', 'in', 'the_inoculum', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'for', 'this_prolonged_entry_phenotype', '.']","Since HCV , including cell_culture -derived_HCV (HCVcc ) , exhibits a_broad_density_profile ( 1.01 – 1.16_g/ml ) , we hypothesized that the_varying_densities of the_HCVcc_particles present in the_inoculum may be responsible for this_prolonged_entry_phenotype .","['HCV', 'cell_culture', '(HCVcc', 'a_broad_density_profile', '1.16_g/ml', 'the_varying_densities', 'the_HCVcc_particles', 'the_inoculum', 'this_prolonged_entry_phenotype']"
"Abstract Background The inflammatory chemokine, interferon-gamma inducible protein of 10kDa (IP-10), is a biomarker associated with several conditions. Objectives This study investigated serum concentrations of IP-10 in healthy individuals who developed acute respiratory infection (ARI). The hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and detection of viral pathogens. Study design Data come from a randomized controlled trial measuring the effects of mindfulness meditation or exercise on ARI (Clinical Trials ID: NCT01654289). Healthy adults ages 30–69 were followed for a single season for ARI incidence and severity. This trial is ongoing, and the investigators are still blinded. When a participant reported ARI symptoms, nasal swab and lavage for PCR-based viral identification and blood samples were collected within the first 72h of ARI symptoms. Serum IP-10 concentrations were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc., Quantikine ELISA, Minneapolis, MN). ARI severity was measured using the validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-24) until the ARI episode resolved. Results Serum IP-10 concentrations from 225 ARI episodes correlated with ARI global severity (rho 0.28 [95% CI: 0.15–0.39]; p <0.001). IP-10 concentrations were higher with an ARI in which a viral pathogen was detected compared to no viral pathogen detected (median 366pg/ml [IQR: 227–486] vs 163pg/ml [IQR: 127–295], p <0.0001). Influenza infections had higher IP-10 concentrations than coronavirus, enterovirus or rhinovirus, and paramyxovirus. Conclusion Serum IP-10 concentration correlates with ARI global severity. Also, IP-10 concentration measured early in the course of the ARI correlates with the daily severity, duration, and illness symptoms.",The hypothesis is that serum IP-10 concentrations correlate with ARI severity and detection of viral pathogens.,"['The_hypothesis', 'is', 'that', 'serum', 'IP-10_concentrations', 'correlate', 'with', 'ARI_severity', 'and', 'detection', 'of', 'viral_pathogens', '.']",The_hypothesis is that serum IP-10_concentrations correlate with ARI_severity and detection of viral_pathogens .,"['The_hypothesis', 'serum IP-10_concentrations', 'ARI_severity', 'detection', 'viral_pathogens']"
"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common bacterial pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Current infection control guidelines aim to prevent transmission via contact and respiratory droplet routes and do not consider the possibility of airborne transmission. It was hypothesised that subjects with CF produce viable respirable bacterial aerosols with coughing. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken of 15 children and 13 adults with CF, 26 chronically infected with P aeruginosa. A cough aerosol sampling system enabled fractioning of respiratory particles of different sizes and culture of viable Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria. Cough aerosols were collected during 5 min of voluntary coughing and during a sputum induction procedure when tolerated. Standardised quantitative culture and genotyping techniques were used. RESULTS: P aeruginosa was isolated in cough aerosols of 25 subjects (89%), 22 of whom produced sputum samples. P aeruginosa from sputum and paired cough aerosols were indistinguishable by molecular typing. In four cases the same genotype was isolated from ambient room air. Approximately 70% of viable aerosols collected during voluntary coughing were of particles ⩽3.3 μm aerodynamic diameter. P aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter xylosoxidans were cultivated from respiratory particles in this size range. Positive room air samples were associated with high total counts in cough aerosols (p = 0.003). The magnitude of cough aerosols was associated with higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r = 0.45, p = 0.02) and higher quantitative sputum culture results (r = 0.58, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: During coughing, patients with CF produce viable aerosols of P aeruginosa and other Gram-negative bacteria of respirable size range, suggesting the potential for airborne transmission.",It was hypothesised that subjects with CF produce viable respirable bacterial aerosols with coughing.,"['It', 'was', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'subjects', 'with', 'CF_produce_viable_respirable_bacterial_aerosols', 'with', 'coughing', '.']",It was hypothesised that subjects with CF_produce_viable_respirable_bacterial_aerosols with coughing .,"['subjects', 'CF_produce_viable_respirable_bacterial_aerosols', 'coughing']"
"Cancer stem cells, also known as cancer initiating cells (CICs), are considered to be responsible for tumor growth and chemoresistance. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs. Part of the difficulty in identifying CICs may stem from the fact that the CICs studied have been largely derived from cancer cell lines or well-developed tumors. In previous studies, we have reported the enrichment of mouse pulmonary stem/progenitor cells (mPSCs) by using serum-free primary selection culture followed by FACS isolation using the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) as the positive selection marker. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of the pluripotent transcription factor Oct-4 is sufficient to induce CAR(+)/mPSCs transformation, which we name CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi). These transformed cells possess cancer initiating and chemoresistance potential, as well as exhibiting remarkable expression of certain proangiogenic factors, including angiopoietins (ANGs) and VEGF, and enhanced angiogenic potential. Moreover, CAR(+)/mPSCs(Oct-4_hi) actively participated in tumor blood vessel formation and triggered a novel angiogenic mechanism, the angiopoietins/Tie2 signaling pathway. These study provide critical evidence supporting the possible origin to generate CICs, and help elucidate the pathways responsible for CICs-mediated blood vessel formation.","Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of CICs, including mutations in adult stem/progenitor cells or the acquisition of stem-like characteristics in differentiated cells; however, studies have yielded conflicting identification for CICs and have little information for the origin to generate CICs.","['Different_hypotheses', 'have', 'been', 'proposed', 'to', 'explain', 'the_origin', 'of', 'CICs', ',', 'including', 'mutations', 'in', 'adult_stem/progenitor_cells', 'or', 'the_acquisition', 'of', 'stem-like_characteristics', 'in', 'differentiated_cells', ';', 'however', ',', 'studies', 'have', 'yielded', 'conflicting_identification', 'for', 'CICs', 'and', 'have', 'little_information', 'for', 'the_origin', 'to', 'generate', 'CICs', '.']","Different_hypotheses have been proposed to explain the_origin of CICs , including mutations in adult_stem/progenitor_cells or the_acquisition of stem-like_characteristics in differentiated_cells ; however , studies have yielded conflicting_identification for CICs and have little_information for the_origin to generate CICs .","['Different_hypotheses', 'the_origin', 'CICs', 'mutations', 'adult_stem/progenitor_cells', 'the_acquisition', 'stem-like_characteristics', 'differentiated_cells', 'studies', 'conflicting_identification', 'CICs', 'little_information', 'the_origin', 'CICs']"
"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a reemerging pathogen causes a self limited illness characterized by fever, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. However, 10–20% affected individuals develop persistent arthralgia which contributes to considerable morbidity. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying these manifestations are not well understood. The present study investigated the possible occurrence of molecular mimicry between CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and host human components. METHODOLOGY: Bioinformatic tools were used to identify peptides of CHIKV E1 exhibiting similarity to host components. Two peptides (A&B) were identified using several bioinformatic tools, synthesised and used to validate the results obtained in silico. An ELISA was designed to assess the immunoreactivity of serum samples from CHIKV patients to these peptides. Further, experiments were conducted in a C57BL/6J experimental mouse model to investigate if peptide A and peptide B were indeed capable of inducing pathology. FINDINGS: The serum samples showed reactivity of varying degrees, indicating that these peptides are indeed being recognized by the host immune system during CHIKV infection. Further, these peptides when injected into C57BL/6J mice were able to induce significant inflammation in the muscles of C57BL/6J mice, similar to that observed in animals that were injected with CHIKV alone. Additionally, animals that were primed initially with CHIKV followed by a subsequent injection of the CHIKV peptides exhibited enhanced inflammatory pathology in the skeletal muscles as compared to animals that were injected with peptides or virus alone.

"Throughout childhood and adolescence, periods of heightened neuroplasticity are critical for the development of healthy brain function and behavior. Given the high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, identifying disruptors of developmental plasticity represents an essential step for developing strategies for prevention and intervention. Applying a novel computational approach that systematically assessed connections between 436 transcriptional signatures of disease and multiple signatures of neuroplasticity, we identified inflammation as a common pathological process central to a diverse set of diseases predicted to dysregulate plasticity signatures. We tested the hypothesis that inflammation disrupts developmental cortical plasticity in vivo using the mouse ocular dominance model of experience-dependent plasticity in primary visual cortex. We found that the administration of systemic lipopolysaccharide suppressed plasticity during juvenile critical period with accompanying transcriptional changes in a particular set of molecular regulators within primary visual cortex. These findings suggest that inflammation may have unrecognized adverse consequences on the postnatal developmental trajectory and indicate that treating inflammation may reduce the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders.",We tested the hypothesis that inflammation disrupts developmental cortical plasticity in vivo using the mouse ocular dominance model of experience-dependent plasticity in primary visual cortex.,"['We', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'inflammation', 'disrupts', 'developmental_cortical_plasticity', 'in', 'vivo', 'using', 'the_mouse_ocular_dominance_model', 'of', 'experience-dependent_plasticity', 'in', 'primary_visual_cortex', '.']",We tested the_hypothesis that inflammation disrupts developmental_cortical_plasticity in vivo using the_mouse_ocular_dominance_model of experience-dependent_plasticity in primary_visual_cortex .,"['the_hypothesis', 'inflammation', 'developmental_cortical_plasticity', 'vivo', 'the_mouse_ocular_dominance_model', 'experience-dependent_plasticity', 'primary_visual_cortex']"
"Membrane fusion induced by the envelope glycoprotein enables the intracellular replication of HIV-1; hence, this process constitutes a major target for antiretroviral compounds. It has been proposed that peptides having propensity to interact with membrane interfaces might exert broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses. To test this hypothesis, in this contribution we have analyzed the antiviral effects of peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region and the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41, which display different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity. Our data support the virucidal activity of a region that combines hydrophobic-at-interface membrane-proximal external region aromatics with hydrophobic residues of the transmembrane domain, and contains the absolutely conserved (679)LWYIK/R(683) sequence, proposed to embody a “cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus” motif. We further sought to correlate the antiviral activity of these peptides and their effects on membranes that mimic lipid composition and biophysical properties of the viral envelope. The data revealed that peptides endowed with virucidal activity were membrane active and induced permeabilization and fusion of virus-like lipid vesicles. In addition, they modulated lipid packing and miscibility of laterally segregated liquid domains, two properties that depend on the high cholesterol content of the viral membrane. Thus, the overall experimental evidence is consistent with a pattern of HIV inhibition that involves direct alteration of the physical chemistry of the virus membrane. Furthermore, the sequence-dependent effects observed might guide the development of new virucidal peptides.","To test this hypothesis, in this contribution we have analyzed the antiviral effects of peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region and the transmembrane domain of the envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41, which display different degrees of interfacial hydrophobicity.","['To', 'test', 'this_hypothesis', ',', 'in', 'this_contribution', 'we', 'have', 'analyzed', 'the_antiviral_effects', 'of', 'peptides', 'derived', 'from', 'the_membrane-proximal_external_region', 'and', 'the_transmembrane_domain', 'of', 'the_envelope_glycoprotein_subunit_gp41', ',', 'which', 'display', 'different_degrees', 'of', 'interfacial_hydrophobicity', '.']","To test this_hypothesis , in this_contribution we have analyzed the_antiviral_effects of peptides derived from the_membrane-proximal_external_region and the_transmembrane_domain of the_envelope_glycoprotein_subunit_gp41 , which display different_degrees of interfacial_hydrophobicity .","['this_contribution', 'the_antiviral_effects', 'peptides', 'the_membrane-proximal_external_region', 'the_transmembrane_domain', 'the_envelope_glycoprotein_subunit_gp41', 'different_degrees', 'interfacial_hydrophobicity']"
"Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are poorly understood autoimmune liver diseases. Immunosuppression is used to treat AIH and ursodeoxycholic acid is used to slow the progression of PBC. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with both disorders progress to liver failure. Following liver transplantation, up to a third of patients with PBC experience recurrent disease. Moreover a syndrome referred to as “de novo AIH” occurs in a proportion of patients regardless of maintenance immunosuppression, who have been transplanted for disorders unrelated to AIH. Of note, the use of cyclosporine A appears to protect against the development of recurrent PBC and de novo AIH even though it is a less potent immunosuppressive compared to tacrolimus. The reason why cyclosporine A is protective has not been determined. However, a virus resembling mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been characterized in patients with PBC and AIH. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the protective effect of cyclosporine A in liver transplant recipients may be mediated by the antiviral activity of this cyclophilin inhibitor. Treatment of the MMTV producing MM5MT cells with different antivirals and immunosuppressive agents showed that both cyclosporine A and the analogue NIM811 inhibited MMTV production from the producer cells. Herein, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of MMTV-like human betaretrovirus in the development of PBC and de novo AIH and speculate on the possibility that the agent may be associated with disease following transplantation. We also review the mechanisms of how both cyclosporine A and NIM811 may inhibit betaretrovirus production in vitro.","Accordingly, we hypothesized that the protective effect of cyclosporine A in liver transplant recipients may be mediated by the antiviral activity of this cyclophilin inhibitor.","['Accordingly', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_protective_effect', 'of', 'cyclosporine_A', 'in', 'liver_transplant_recipients', 'may', 'be', 'mediated', 'by', 'the_antiviral_activity', 'of', 'this_cyclophilin_inhibitor', '.']","Accordingly , we hypothesized that the_protective_effect of cyclosporine_A in liver_transplant_recipients may be mediated by the_antiviral_activity of this_cyclophilin_inhibitor .","['the_protective_effect', 'cyclosporine_A', 'liver_transplant_recipients', 'this_cyclophilin_inhibitor']"
"Cowpox virus infections in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) with high morbidity and mortality have already been reported in the UK and Russia in the 1970s. However, most of the reported cases have been singular events. Here, we report a total of five cowpox virus outbreaks in cheetahs in the same safari park in Denmark between 2010 and 2014. Nine cheetahs showed varying severity of clinical disease; two of them died (22%). All episodes occurred between August and October of the respective year. No other carnivores kept at the same institution nor the keepers taking care of the animals were clinically affected. The clinical picture of cowpox was confirmed by extensive laboratory investigations including histopathological and molecular analyses as well as cell culture isolation of a cowpox virus. High anti-orthopoxvirus antibody titers were detected in all 9 diseased cheetahs compared to seven contact cheetahs without clinical signs and 13 cheetahs not in direct contact. Additionally, whole genome sequencing from one sample of each cluster with subsequent phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from different outbreaks have individual sequences but clearly form a clade distinct from other cowpox viruses. However, the intra-clade distances are still larger than those usually observed within clades of one event. These findings indicate multiple and separate introductions of cowpox virus, probably from wild rodent populations, where the virus keeps circulating naturally and is only sporadically introduced into the cheetahs. Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis. As a consequence, recommendations are given for medical and physical management of diseased cheetahs, for hygienic measures as well as for pre-shipment isolation before cheetah export from zoo grounds.",Sero-positivity of voles (Arvicola amphibious) caught in zoo grounds strengthens this hypothesis.,"['Sero-positivity', 'of', 'voles', '(', 'Arvicola', 'amphibious', ')', 'caught', 'in', 'zoo_grounds', 'strengthens', 'this_hypothesis', '.']",Sero-positivity of voles ( Arvicola amphibious ) caught in zoo_grounds strengthens this_hypothesis .,"['Sero-positivity', 'voles', 'Arvicola', 'zoo_grounds']"
"The innate immune system of humans and other mammals responds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are conserved across broad classes of infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. We hypothesized that a blood-based transcriptional signature could be discovered indicating a host systemic response to viral infection. Previous work identified host transcriptional signatures to individual viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue, but the generality of these signatures across all viral infection types has not been established. Based on 44 publicly available datasets and two clinical studies of our own design, we discovered and validated a four-gene expression signature in whole blood, indicative of a general host systemic response to many types of viral infection. The signature’s genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5). In each of 13 validation datasets encompassing human, macaque, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat and all seven Baltimore virus classification groups, the signature provides statistically significant (p < 0.05) discrimination between viral and non-viral conditions.

"Study objectives: Little is known of the nature of the recovery period after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection. We hypothesized that structural changes of the lung might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. To answer this question, we correlate findings of high-resolution CT (HRCT) with dyspnea scores and results of pulmonary function tests in patients during recovery from SARS. Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Nineteen patients who recovered from SARS-related hospitalization. Measurements: The study included HRCT scores (0 to 100), dyspnea scores (1 to 4), static and dynamic lung volumes, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco). Results: The interval between hospital discharge and HRCT study or functional assessment was 31.2 ± 4.8 days (range, 25 to 38 days) [mean ± SD]. All patients had HRCT abnormalities and were assigned to two groups: ground-glass opacity (GGO) only (n = 7, 36.8%) and GGO with fibrosis (GGO+F) [n = 12, 63.2%]. Most patients (16 of 19, 84.2%) had no zonal predominance. HRCT scores correlated well with dyspnea scores (r = 0.78, p < 0.01) and with a variety of pulmonary functional variables, with Dlco being the most significant (r = − 0.923, p < 0.001). Compared with the GGO group, the GGO+F group showed significantly lower FEV1, FVC, total lung capacity, residual volume, and Dlco. Conclusions: HRCT findings correlate well with functional studies and clinical symptoms during recovery from SARS.

"Much of the worlds' population is in active or imminent danger from established infectious pathogens, while sporadic and pandemic infections by these and emerging agents threaten everyone. RNA polymerases (RNA(pol)) generate enormous genetic and consequent antigenic heterogeneity permitting both viruses and cellular pathogens to evade host defences. Thus, RNA(pol )causes more morbidity and premature mortality than any other molecule. The extraordinary genetic heterogeneity defining viral quasispecies results from RNA(pol )infidelity causing rapid cumulative genomic RNA mutation a process that, if uncontrolled, would cause catastrophic loss of sequence integrity and inexorable quasispecies extinction. Selective replication and replicative homeostasis, an epicyclical regulatory mechanism dynamically linking RNApol fidelity and processivity with quasispecies phenotypic diversity, modulating polymerase fidelity and, hence, controlling quasispecies behaviour, prevents this happening and also mediates immune escape. Perhaps more importantly, ineluctable generation of broad phenotypic diversity after viral RNA is translated to protein quasispecies suggests a mechanism of disease that specifically targets, and functionally disrupts, the host cell surface molecules – including hormone, lipid, cell signalling or neurotransmitter receptors – that viruses co-opt for cell entry. This mechanism – %22Viral Receptor Disease (VRD)%22 – may explain so-called %22viral autoimmunity%22, some classical autoimmune disorders and other diseases, including type II diabetes mellitus, and some forms of obesity.

"The elderly population infected with HIV-1 is often characterized by the rapid AIDS progression and poor treatment outcome, possibly because of immunosenescence resulting from both HIV infection and aging. However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested. Here, we studied 6 young and 12 old Chinese rhesus macaques (ChRM) over the course of three months after simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVmac239 infection. Old ChRM showed a higher risk of accelerated AIDS development than did young macaques, owing to rapidly elevated plasma viral loads and decreased levels of CD4(+) T cells. The low frequency of naïve CD4(+) T cells before infection was strongly predictive of an increased disease progression, whereas the severe depletion of CD4(+) T cells and the rapid proliferation of naïve lymphocytes accelerated the exhaustion of naïve lymphocytes in old ChRM. Moreover, in old ChRM, a robust innate host response with defective regulation was associated with a compensation for naïve T cell depletion and a high level of immune activation. Therefore, we suggest that immunosenescence plays an important role in the accelerated AIDS progression in elderly individuals and that SIV-infected old ChRM may be a favorable model for studying AIDS pathogenesis and researching therapies for elderly AIDS patients.","However, this hypothesis remains to be fully tested.","['However', ',', 'this_hypothesis', 'remains', 'to', 'be', 'fully', 'tested', '.']","However , this_hypothesis remains to be fully tested .",[]
"Viruses have been infecting their host cells since the dawn of life, and this extremely long-term coevolution gave rise to some surprising consequences for the entire tree of life. It is hypothesised that viruses might have contributed to the formation of the first cellular life form, or that even the eukaryotic cell nucleus originates from an infection by a coated virus. The continuous struggle between viruses and their hosts to maintain at least a constant fitness level led to the development of an unceasing arms race, where weapons are often shuttled between the participants. In this literature review we try to give a short insight into some general consequences or traits of virus–host coevolution, and after this we zoom in to the viral clades of adenoviruses, herpesviruses, nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses, polyomaviruses and, finally, circoviruses.","It is hypothesised that viruses might have contributed to the formation of the first cellular life form, or that even the eukaryotic cell nucleus originates from an infection by a coated virus.","['It', 'is', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'viruses', 'might', 'have', 'contributed', 'to', 'the_formation', 'of', 'the_first_cellular_life_form', ',', 'or', 'that', 'even_the_eukaryotic_cell_nucleus', 'originates', 'from', 'an_infection', 'by', 'a_coated_virus', '.']","It is hypothesised that viruses might have contributed to the_formation of the_first_cellular_life_form , or that even_the_eukaryotic_cell_nucleus originates from an_infection by a_coated_virus .","['viruses', 'the_formation', 'the_first_cellular_life_form', 'even_the_eukaryotic_cell_nucleus', 'originates', 'an_infection', 'a_coated_virus']"
"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in detection of Enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) among patients with severe respiratory infections worldwide. EV-D68 is now recognized as a re-emerging pathogen; however, due to lack of a permissive animal model for EV-D68, a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and immune response against EV-D68 has been hampered. Recently, it was shown that EV-D68 has a strong affinity for α2,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) and we have shown previously that α2,6-linked SAs are abundantly present in the respiratory tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection. Here, we evaluated the ability of two recently isolated EV-D68 strains (VANBT/1 and MO/14/49), along with the historical prototype Fermon strain (ATCC), to infect cotton rats. We found that cotton rats are permissive to EV-D68 infection without virus adaptation. The different strains of EV-D68 showed variable infection profiles and the ability to produce neutralizing antibody (NA) upon intranasal infection or intramuscular immunization. Infection with the VANBT/1 resulted in significant induction of pulmonary cytokine gene expression and lung pathology. Intramuscular immunization with live VANBT/1 or MO/14/49 induced strong homologous antibody responses, but a moderate heterologous NA response. We showed that passive prophylactic administration of serum with high content of NA against VANBT/1 resulted in an efficient antiviral therapy. VANBT/1-immunized animals showed complete protection from VANBT/1 challenge, but induced strong pulmonary Th1 and Th2 cytokine responses and enhanced lung pathology, indicating the generation of exacerbated immune response by immunization. In conclusion, our data illustrate that the cotton rat is a powerful animal model that provides an experimental platform to investigate pathogenesis, immune response, anti-viral therapies and vaccines against EV-D68 infection.","Thus, we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a potential model for EV-D68 infection.","['Thus', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'cotton', 'rats', 'could', 'be', 'a_potential_model', 'for', 'EV-D68_infection', '.']","Thus , we hypothesized that cotton rats could be a_potential_model for EV-D68_infection .","['cotton', 'rats', 'a_potential_model', 'EV-D68_infection']"
"Infection with nidoviruses like corona- and arteriviruses induces a reticulovesicular network of interconnected endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and other membrane structures. This network is thought to accommodate the viral replication machinery and protect it from innate immune detection. We hypothesized that the innate immune response has tools to counteract the formation of these virus-induced replication organelles in order to inhibit virus replication. Here we have investigated the effect of type I interferon (IFN) treatment on the formation of arterivirus-induced membrane structures. Our approach involved ectopic expression of arterivirus nonstructural proteins nsp2 and nsp3, which induce DMV formation in the absence of other viral triggers of the interferon response, such as replicating viral RNA. Thus, this setup can be used to identify immune effectors that specifically target the (formation of) virus-induced membrane structures. Using large-scale electron microscopy mosaic maps, we found that IFN-β treatment significantly reduced the formation of the membrane structures. Strikingly, we also observed abundant stretches of double-membrane sheets (a proposed intermediate of DMV formation) in IFN-β-treated samples, suggesting the disruption of DMV biogenesis. Three interferon-stimulated gene products, two of which have been reported to target the hepatitis C virus replication structures, were tested for their possible involvement, but none of them affected membrane structure formation. Our study reveals the existence of a previously unknown innate immune mechanism that antagonizes the viral hijacking of host membranes. It also provides a solid basis for further research into the poorly understood interactions between the innate immune system and virus-induced replication structures.",We hypothesized that the innate immune response has tools to counteract the formation of these virus-induced replication organelles in order to inhibit virus replication.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_innate_immune_response', 'has', 'tools', 'to', 'counteract', 'the_formation', 'of', 'these_virus-induced_replication_organelles', 'in', 'order', 'to', 'inhibit', 'virus_replication', '.']",We hypothesized that the_innate_immune_response has tools to counteract the_formation of these_virus-induced_replication_organelles in order to inhibit virus_replication .,"['the_innate_immune_response', 'tools', 'the_formation', 'these_virus-induced_replication_organelles', 'order', 'virus_replication']"
"Abstract Background Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease in China, Japan, and Korea, which is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and high mortality. It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS. However, limited data have been published on the detailed kinetics of the viral load and cytokine profiles throughout the course of this disease. Objectives We investigated the patterns of changes in cytokines and viral load in SFTS patients. Study design During the admission period of patients, RNA was extracted from plasma and quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In addition, cytokine bead arrays were performed for the 18 cytokines and chemokines selected for testing. Results The median time from admission to the negative conversion of SFTS viremia was 17.0 days. When censored patients were found to be negative for viral load at discharge, the median duration of viral shedding was 13.0 days (95% CI, 5.4–20.6). Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10 concentrations significantly increased in the early course of disease and then decreased during the hospital stay. However, the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increased during the late course of disease. Initial IP-10 levels during hospital days 1–4 were the most significantly correlated with initial viral load (r = 0.88, P < .01). Conclusion SFTS viremia persisted until weeks 2–3 and was highly correlated with initial plasma IP-10 levels. In addition, IFN-α, IL-10, and IP-10 were associated with the initial cytokine storm in SFTS.",It is hypothesized that a cytokine storm plays an important role in the pathophysiology of SFTS.,"['It', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'a_cytokine_storm', 'plays', 'an_important_role', 'in', 'the_pathophysiology', 'of', 'SFTS', '.']",It is hypothesized that a_cytokine_storm plays an_important_role in the_pathophysiology of SFTS .,"['a_cytokine_storm', 'an_important_role', 'the_pathophysiology', 'SFTS']"
"BACKGROUND: Female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus-like particles into their caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity. These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. RESULTS: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.","Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.","['Structural_similarities', 'between', 'ascovirus_and_ichnovirus_particles', 'and', 'the_biology', 'of', 'their_transmission', 'suggest', 'that', 'ichnoviruses', 'evolved', 'from', 'ascoviruses', ',', 'although', 'molecular_evidence', 'for', 'this_hypothesis', 'is', 'lacking', '.']","Structural_similarities between ascovirus_and_ichnovirus_particles and the_biology of their_transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses , although molecular_evidence for this_hypothesis is lacking .","['Structural_similarities', 'ascovirus_and_ichnovirus_particles', 'the_biology', 'their_transmission', 'ichnoviruses', 'ascoviruses', 'molecular_evidence', 'this_hypothesis']"
"Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) are members of the family Filoviridae (‘filoviruses’) that cause severe hemorrhagic fever with human case fatality rates of up to 90%. Filovirus infection requires fusion of the host cell and virus membranes, a process that is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein (GP). GP contains two subunits, the surface subunit (GP1), which is responsible for cell attachment, and the transmembrane subunit (GP2), which catalyzes membrane fusion. The GP2 ectodomain contains two heptad repeat regions, N-terminal and C-terminal (NHR and CHR, respectively) that adopt a six-helix bundle during the fusion process. The refolding of this six-helix bundle provides the thermodynamic driving force to overcome barriers associated with membrane fusion. Here we report the crystal structure of the MARV GP2 core domain in its post-fusion (six-helix bundle) conformation at 1.9 Å resolution. The MARV GP2 core domain backbone conformation is virtually identical to that of EBOV GP2 (reported previously), and consists of a central NHR core trimeric coiled-coil packed against peripheral CHR α-helices and an intervening loop/helix-turn-helix segment. We previously reported that the stability of the MARV GP2 post-fusion structure is highly pH-dependent, with increasing stability at lower pH [Harrison, J.S.; Koellhoffer, J. K.; Chandran, K.; and Lai, J. R. Biochemistry, 2012, 51, 2515–2525]. We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the post-fusion six helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately matured endosomes. In this report, a structural rationale for this pH-dependent stability is described, and involves a high-density array of core and surface acidic side chains at the midsection of the structure, termed the ‘anion stripe.’ In addition, many surface-exposed salt bridges likely contribute to stabilizing the post-fusion structure at low pH. These results provide structural insights into the mechanism of MARV GP2-mediated membrane fusion.",We hypothesized that this pH-dependent stability provides a mechanism for conformational control such that the post-fusion six helix bundle is promoted in the environments of appropriately matured endosomes.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'this_pH-dependent_stability', 'provides', 'a_mechanism', 'for', 'conformational_control', 'such', 'that', 'the_post-fusion_six_helix_bundle', 'is', 'promoted', 'in', 'the_environments', 'of', 'appropriately_matured_endosomes', '.']",We hypothesized that this_pH-dependent_stability provides a_mechanism for conformational_control such that the_post-fusion_six_helix_bundle is promoted in the_environments of appropriately_matured_endosomes .,"['this_pH-dependent_stability', 'a_mechanism', 'conformational_control', 'such that the_post-fusion_six_helix_bundle', 'the_environments', 'appropriately_matured_endosomes']"
"More than 140 post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) are known to decorate cellular RNAs, but their incidence, identity and significance in viral RNA are still largely unknown. We have developed an agnostic analytical approach to comprehensively survey PTMs on viral and cellular RNAs. Specifically, we used mass spectrometry to analyze PTMs on total RNA isolated from cells infected with Zika virus, Dengue virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. All five RNA viruses significantly altered global PTM landscapes. Examination of PTM profiles of individual viral genomes isolated by affinity capture revealed a plethora of PTMs on viral RNAs, which far exceeds the handful of well-characterized modifications. Direct comparison of viral epitranscriptomes identified common and virus-specific PTMs. In particular, specific dimethylcytosine modifications were only present in total RNA from virus-infected cells, and in intracellular HCV RNA, and viral RNA from Zika and HCV virions. Moreover, dimethylcytosine abundance during viral infection was modulated by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX6. By opening the Pandora’s box on viral PTMs, this report presents numerous questions and hypotheses on PTM function and strongly supports PTMs as a new tier of regulation by which RNA viruses subvert the host and evade cellular surveillance systems.","By opening the Pandora’s box on viral PTMs, this report presents numerous questions and hypotheses on PTM function and strongly supports PTMs as a new tier of regulation by which RNA viruses subvert the host and evade cellular surveillance systems.","['By', 'opening', 'the_Pandora’s_box', 'on', 'viral_PTMs', ',', 'this_report', 'presents', 'numerous_questions', 'and', 'hypotheses', 'on', 'PTM_function', 'and', 'strongly', 'supports', 'PTMs', 'as', 'a_new_tier', 'of', 'regulation', 'by', 'which', 'RNA_viruses', 'subvert', 'the_host', 'and', 'evade', 'cellular_surveillance_systems', '.']","By opening the_Pandora’s_box on viral_PTMs , this_report presents numerous_questions and hypotheses on PTM_function and strongly supports PTMs as a_new_tier of regulation by which RNA_viruses subvert the_host and evade cellular_surveillance_systems .","['the_Pandora’s_box', 'viral_PTMs', 'this_report', 'numerous_questions', 'PTM_function', 'PTMs', 'a_new_tier', 'regulation', 'the_host', 'cellular_surveillance_systems']"
"Abstract We have hypothesized that genetic predisposition influences the progression of SARS. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE1) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was previously reported to show association with the adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is also thought to play a key role in damaging the lung tissues in SARS cases. This time, the polymorphism was genotyped in 44 Vietnamese SARS cases, with 103 healthy controls who had had a contact with the SARS patients and 50 controls without any contact history. SARS cases were divided into either non-hypoxemic or hypoxemic groups. Despite the small sample size, the frequency of the D allele was significantly higher in the hypoxemic group than in the non-hypoxemic group (p =0.013), whereas there was no significant difference between the SARS cases and controls, irrespective of a contact history. ACE1 might be one of the candidate genes that influence the progression of pneumonia in SARS.",Abstract We have hypothesized that genetic predisposition influences the progression of SARS.,"['Abstract', 'We', 'have', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'genetic_predisposition', 'influences', 'the_progression', 'of', 'SARS', '.']",Abstract We have hypothesized that genetic_predisposition influences the_progression of SARS .,"['Abstract', 'genetic_predisposition', 'the_progression', 'SARS']"
"This study describes a spring 2013 outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), using data from 222 swine sites in 14 counties area in 4 contiguous states in the United States. During the outbreak, the premises-level incidence of PEDv was 40.5 percent (90/222 sites). One of the three companies from which data were collected had a lower incidence (19.5 percent) than the other two companies (41.1 and 47.2 percent). Sow sites had the highest incidence of PEDv during the outbreak (80.0 percent). Spatial analysis showed that PEDv was clustered rather than randomly distributed, which suggested that sites near a positive site had increased risk of acquiring PEDv infection. Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. If airborne dissemination played a role in this outbreak, we would expect the direction of disease spread to correlate with the predominant wind direction. Two methods were used to determine the direction of disease spread—linear direction mean analysis in ArcGIS and the direction test in ClusterSeer. The former method indicated PEDv spread was south to slightly southwest, and the latter indicated spread was to the southeast. The predominant wind direction during the month of the outbreak was toward the south, with some southeast and southwest winds; the strongest wind gusts were toward the southwest. These findings support the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air. The results, however, should be interpreted cautiously because we did not have information on direct and indirect contacts between sites, such as movement of trucks, feed, pigs or people. These types of contacts should be evaluated before pathogen spread is attributed to airborne mechanisms. Although this study did not provide a definitive assessment of airborne spread of PEDv, we believe the findings justify additional research to investigate this potential mechanism of transmission.",Meteorological data were used to investigate the hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air.,"['Meteorological_data', 'were', 'used', 'to', 'investigate', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'PEDv', 'was', 'spread', 'by', 'air', '.']",Meteorological_data were used to investigate the_hypothesis that PEDv was spread by air .,"['Meteorological_data', 'the_hypothesis', 'PEDv', 'air']"
"In a novel approach, the standard birth–death process is extended to incorporate a fundamental mechanism undergone by intracellular bacteria, phagocytosis. The model accounts for stochastic interaction between bacteria and cells of the immune system and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection of individual hosts within a population. Model output is the dose–response relation and the dose-dependent distribution of time until response, where response is the onset of symptoms. The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium. Results indicate a median infectious dose of about 23 organisms, which is higher than previously thought, and an average incubation period of between 3 and 7 days depending on dose. The distribution of incubation periods is right-skewed up to about 100 organisms and symmetric for larger doses. Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose–response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model). The findings of this study support experimental evidence and postulations from other investigations that response is, in fact, influenced by both in-host and between-host variability.","Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose–response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model).","['Moreover', ',', 'there', 'are', 'some_interesting_parallels', 'to', 'the_hypotheses', 'of', 'some', 'of', 'the_classical_dose', '–', 'response_models', ',', 'such', 'as', 'independent_action', '(single-hit_model', ')', 'and', 'individual_effective_dose', '(', 'probit_model', ')', '.']","Moreover , there are some_interesting_parallels to the_hypotheses of some of the_classical_dose – response_models , such as independent_action (single-hit_model ) and individual_effective_dose ( probit_model ) .","['some_interesting_parallels', 'the_hypotheses', 'the_classical_dose', 'response_models', 'independent_action', 'single-hit_model', 'probit_model']"
"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are considered a major threat to global health. Most EIDs appear to result from increased contact between wildlife and humans, especially when humans encroach into formerly pristine habitats. Habitat deterioration may also negatively affect the physiology and health of wildlife species, which may eventually lead to a higher susceptibility to infectious agents and/or increased shedding of the pathogens causing EIDs. Bats are known to host viruses closely related to important EIDs. Here, we tested in a paleotropical forest with ongoing logging and fragmentation, whether habitat disturbance influences the occurrence of astro- and coronaviruses in eight bat species. In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples. However, we found that bats infected with either astro- or coronaviruses were likely to be coinfected with the respective other virus. Additionally, we identified two more risk factors influencing astrovirus shedding. First, the detection rate of astroviruses was higher at the beginning of the rainy compared to the dry season. Second, there was a trend that individuals with a poor body condition had a higher probability of shedding astroviruses in their feces. The identification of risk factors for increased viral shedding that may potentially result in increased interspecies transmission is important to prevent viral spillovers from bats to other animals, including humans.","In contrast to our hypothesis, anthropogenic habitat disturbance was not associated with corona- and astrovirus detection rates in fecal samples.","['In', 'contrast', 'to', 'our_hypothesis', ',', 'anthropogenic_habitat_disturbance', 'was', 'not', 'associated', 'with', 'corona-_and_astrovirus_detection_rates', 'in', 'fecal_samples', '.']","In contrast to our_hypothesis , anthropogenic_habitat_disturbance was not associated with corona-_and_astrovirus_detection_rates in fecal_samples .","['contrast', 'our_hypothesis', 'anthropogenic_habitat_disturbance', 'corona-_and_astrovirus_detection_rates', 'fecal_samples']"
"The upper airway – which consists mainly of the naso- and oro-pharynx - is the first point of contact between the respiratory system and microbial organisms that are ubiquitous in the environment. It has evolved highly specialised functions to address these constant threats whilst facilitating seamless respiratory exchange with the lower respiratory tract. Dysregulation of its critical homeostatic and defence functions can lead to ingress of pathogens into the lower respiratory tract, potentially leading to serious illness. Systems-wide proteomic tools may facilitate a better understanding of mechanisms in the upper airways in health and disease. In this study, we aimed to develop a mass spectrometry based proteomics method for characterizing the upper airways proteome. Naso- and oropharyngeal swab samples used in all our experiments had been eluted in the Universal Transport Media (UTM) containing significantly high levels of bovine serum albumin. Our proteomic experiments tested the optimal approach to characterize airway proteome on swab samples eluted in UTM based on the number of proteins identified without BSA depletion (Total proteome: Protocol A) and with its depletion using a commercial kit; Allprep, Qiagen (cellular proteome: Protocol B, Ci, and Cii). Observations and lessons drawn from protocol A, fed into the design and implementation of protocol B, and from B to protocol Ci and finally Cii. Label free proteome quantification was used in Protocol A (n = 6) and B (n = 4) while commercial TMT 10plex reagents were used for protocols Ci and ii (n = 83). Protocols Ci and ii were carried out under similar conditions except for the elution gradient: 3 h and 6 h respectively. Swab samples tested in this study were from infants and children with and without upper respiratory tract infections from Kilifi County Hospital on the Kenyan Coast. Protocol A had the least number of proteins identified (215) while B produced the highest number of protein identifications (2396). When Protocol B was modified through sample multiplexing with TMT to enable higher throughput (Protocol Ci), the number of protein identified reduced to 1432. Modification of protocol Ci by increasing the peptide elution time generated Protocol Cii that substantially increased the number of proteins identified to 1875. The coefficient of variation among the TMT runs in Protocol Cii was <20%. There was substantial overlap in the identity of proteins using the four protocols. Our method was were able to identify marker proteins characteristically expressed in the upper airway. We found high expression levels of signature nasopharyngeal and oral proteins, including BPIFA1/2 and AMY1A, as well as a high abundance of proteins related to innate and adaptive immune function in the upper airway. We have developed a sensitive systems-level proteomic assay for the systematic quantification of naso-oro-pharyngeal proteins.

"BACKGROUND: Although feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) have similar risk factors and control measures, infection rates have been speculated to vary in geographic distribution over North America. Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. RESULTS: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor. Putative factors may be geographic variations in specific virus strains and rate of vaccination. Knowledge of these factors and the geographical distributions of these infections can inform recommendations for testing, management and prevention. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association of these factors with FIV and FeLV.","Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar.","['Since', 'both_infections', 'are', 'endemic', 'in', 'North_America', ',', 'it', 'was', 'assumed', 'as', 'a_working_hypothesis', 'that', 'their_geographic_distributions', 'were', 'similar', '.']","Since both_infections are endemic in North_America , it was assumed as a_working_hypothesis that their_geographic_distributions were similar .","['both_infections', 'North_America', 'a_working_hypothesis', 'their_geographic_distributions']"
"We are currently faced with a global infectious disease crisis which has been anticipated for decades. While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35. These computational models may provide preliminary insights into the molecular features that are responsible for their activity against Ebola virus in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested.",and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested.,"['and', 'we', 'propose', 'that', 'this_hypothesis', 'could', 'be', 'readily', 'tested', '.']",and we propose that this_hypothesis could be readily tested .,[]
"HCV infection is a major risk factor for liver cancer and liver transplantation worldwide. Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism in the liver by HCV-encoded proteins during viral infection creates a favorable environment for virus propagation and pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs). One such master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways is the host subtilisin/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) – or site-1 protease (S1P). SKI-1/S1P plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which control expression of the key enzymes of cholesterol and fatty-acid biosynthesis. Here we report the development of a SKI-1/S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor and its application to blocking the SREBP signaling cascade. We demonstrate that SKI-1/S1P inhibition effectively blocks HCV from establishing infection in hepatoma cells. The inhibitory mechanism is associated with a dramatic reduction in the abundance of neutral lipids, LDs, and the LD marker: adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)/perilipin 2. Reduction of LD formation inhibits virus assembly from infected cells. Importantly, we confirm that SKI-1/S1P is a key host factor for HCV infection by using a specific active, site-directed, small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P: PF-429242. Our studies identify SKI-1/S1P as both a novel regulator of the HCV lifecycle and as a potential host-directed therapeutic target against HCV infection and liver steatosis. With identification of an increasing number of human viruses that use host LDs for infection, our results suggest that SKI-1/S1P inhibitors may allow development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals that could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral options with the current standard of care.","In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs).","['In', 'this_study', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'targeting', 'cellular_enzymes', 'acting', 'as', 'master_regulators', 'of', 'lipid_homeostasis', 'could', 'represent', 'a_powerful_approach', 'to', 'developing', 'a_novel_class', 'of', 'broad-spectrum_antivirals', 'against', 'infection', 'associated', 'with', 'human_Flaviviridae_viruses', 'such', 'as', 'hepatitis_C_virus', '(', 'HCV', ')', ',', 'whose_assembly', 'and', 'pathogenesis', 'depend', 'on', 'interaction', 'with', 'lipid_droplets', '(', 'LDs', ')', '.']","In this_study , we hypothesize that targeting cellular_enzymes acting as master_regulators of lipid_homeostasis could represent a_powerful_approach to developing a_novel_class of broad-spectrum_antivirals against infection associated with human_Flaviviridae_viruses such as hepatitis_C_virus ( HCV ) , whose_assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid_droplets ( LDs ) .","['this_study', 'cellular_enzymes', 'master_regulators', 'lipid_homeostasis', 'a_powerful_approach', 'a_novel_class', 'broad-spectrum_antivirals', 'infection', 'human_Flaviviridae_viruses', 'hepatitis_C_virus', 'HCV', 'pathogenesis', 'interaction', 'lipid_droplets', 'LDs']"
"BACKGROUND: Airborne transmission of respiratory infectious disease in indoor environment (e.g. airplane cabin, conference room, hospital, isolated room and inpatient ward) may cause outbreaks of infectious diseases, which may lead to many infection cases and significantly influences on the public health. This issue has received more and more attentions from academics. This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission. METHODS: The Eulerian–Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The dose–response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants. The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions. An in-flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation. A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors. A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system. RESULTS: The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols, significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin. The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered. The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers. CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important. For future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control.

"An important determinant of a pathogen's success is the rate at which it is transmitted from infected to susceptible hosts. Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.","The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones.","['The_results', 'provide', 'support', 'for', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_clones', 'responded', 'differently', 'to', 'an_infection_control_measure', 'based', 'on', 'the_use', 'of', 'topical_antiseptics', ',', 'which', 'was', 'more', 'effective', 'at', 'reducing', 'transmission', 'of', 'endemic_clones', '.']","The_results provide support for the_hypothesis that the_clones responded differently to an_infection_control_measure based on the_use of topical_antiseptics , which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic_clones .","['The_results', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_clones', 'topical_antiseptics', 'transmission', 'endemic_clones']"
"We have previously observed that all known potent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV-1 are highly divergent from their putative germline predecessors in contrast to bnAbs against viruses causing acute infections such as henipaviruses and SARS CoV, which are much less divergent from their germline counterparts. Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs. We have further hypothesized that the immunogenicity of highly conserved epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) may be reduced or eliminated by their very weak or absent interactions with germline antibodies and immune responses leading to the elicitation of bnAbs may not be initiated and/or sustained. Even if such responses are initiated, the maturation pathways are so extraordinarily complex that prolonged periods of time may be required for elicitation of bnAbs with defined unique sequences. We provided the initial evidence supporting this antibody germline/maturation hypothesis, which prompted a number of studies to design vaccine immunogens that could bind putative germline predecessors of known bnAbs and to explore complex B cell lineages. However, guiding the immune system through the exceptionally complex antibody maturation pathways to elicit known bnAbs remains a major challenge. Here, we discuss studies exploring the antibody germline/maturation hypothesis as related to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 and present our recent data demonstrating the existence of germline-like precursors of VRC01 antibodies in a human cord blood IgM library.","Consequently, we have hypothesized that germline antibodies may not bind to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) because they are so different compared to the highly somatically mutated HIV-1-specific bnAbs.","['Consequently', ',', 'we', 'have', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'germline_antibodies', 'may', 'not', 'bind', 'to', 'the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein', '(', 'Env', ')', 'because', 'they', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'compared', 'to', 'the_highly_somatically_mutated_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs', '.']","Consequently , we have hypothesized that germline_antibodies may not bind to the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein ( Env ) because they are so different compared to the_highly_somatically_mutated_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs .","['germline_antibodies', 'the_HIV-1_envelope_glycoprotein', '( Env', 'the_highly_somatically_mutated_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs']"
"Owing to the reports of microcephaly as a consistent outcome in the fetuses of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Brazil, Zika virus (ZIKV)—microcephaly etiomechanistic relationship has recently been implicated. Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker “retinoic acid” in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5′–AGGTCA–3′) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required). The numbers of RARE sequence repeats appeared to match with the virulence of screened positive viruses. Although, bioinformatic evidence and embryological features are in favor of our hypothesis, additional studies including animal models are warranted to validate our proposition. Such studies are likely to unfold ZIKV-microcephaly association and may help in devising methods to combat it.",We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of,"['We', 'screened', 'genomic_sequences', 'of', 'already', 'reported', 'virulent_ZIKV_strains', '(', 'including', 'those', 'linked', 'to', 'microcephaly', ')', 'and', 'other_viruses', 'available', 'in', 'National', 'Institute', 'of', 'Health', 'genetic', 'sequence', 'database', '(', 'GenBank', ')', 'for', 'the_RARE_consensus_repeats', 'and', 'obtained', 'results', 'strongly', 'bolstering', 'our_hypothesis', 'that', 'ZIKV', 'strains', 'associated', 'with', 'microcephaly', 'may', 'act', 'through', 'precipitation', 'of', 'dysregulation', 'in', 'retinoic_acid-dependent_genes', 'by', 'introducing', 'extra_stretches', 'of']",We screened genomic_sequences of already reported virulent_ZIKV_strains ( including those linked to microcephaly ) and other_viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database ( GenBank ) for the_RARE_consensus_repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our_hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic_acid-dependent_genes by introducing extra_stretches of,"['genomic_sequences', 'virulent_ZIKV_strains', 'microcephaly', 'other_viruses', 'National', 'Institute', 'Health', 'sequence', 'database', 'GenBank', 'the_RARE_consensus_repeats', 'results', 'our_hypothesis', 'ZIKV', 'microcephaly', 'precipitation', 'dysregulation', 'retinoic_acid-dependent_genes', 'extra_stretches']"
"Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), originally described in 1956, is a unique familial, chronic renal disease encountered with a high-prevalence rate in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The most prominent features of the disease are its endemic nature, long-incubation period, familial clustering of the disease and an unusually high incidence of associated upper urothelial cancer (UUC). There are no clear-cut data on BEN incidence and prevalence, since the studies carried out in different endemic areas yielded contradictory information. In spite of intermittent variations, the incidence of new cases has remained stable over time. It has been estimated that almost 100 000 people are at risk of BEN, whereas 25 000 have the disease. The clinical signs and symptoms of BEN are non-specific and often remain unrecognized for years. There are no pathognomonic diagnostic features of BEN, but the set of epidemiological, clinical and biochemical data along with the pattern of pathologic injury in the absence of any other renal diseases are highly suggestive of this entity. Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN. Studies conducted over the past decade have provided particularly strong arguments that BEN and UUC are caused by chronic poisoning with aristolochic acids (AAs). In light of these later studies, one can raise the question whether AAs could be responsible for previously and currently widespread unrecognized global renal disease and UUC.","Although the aetiology has been extensively studied, fostering the publication of various hypotheses, only one of them has provided conclusive evidence related to the aetiology of BEN.","['Although', 'the_aetiology', 'has', 'been', 'extensively', 'studied', ',', 'fostering', 'the_publication', 'of', 'various_hypotheses', ',', 'only', 'one', 'of', 'them', 'has', 'provided', 'conclusive_evidence', 'related', 'to', 'the_aetiology', 'of', 'BEN', '.']","Although the_aetiology has been extensively studied , fostering the_publication of various_hypotheses , only one of them has provided conclusive_evidence related to the_aetiology of BEN .","['the_aetiology', 'various_hypotheses', 'conclusive_evidence', 'the_aetiology', 'BEN']"
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects about 0.1% of the worldwide population. This deleterious disease is marked by infiltration of myelinspecific T cells that attack the protective myelin sheath that surrounds CNS nerve axons. Upon demyelination, saltatory nerve conduction is disrupted, and patients experience neurologic deficiencies. The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development. Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens, such as viruses, as potentially key contributors to MS induction. Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well-studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry occurs when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross-react with self-epitopes, leading to autoimmune tissue destruction. In this review, we discuss an in vivo virus-induced mouse model of MS developed in our laboratory, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry-induced CNS autoimmunity.","The exact cause for MS remains unknown, although most evidence supports the hypothesis that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development.","['The_exact_cause', 'for', 'MS', 'remains', 'unknown', ',', 'although', 'most_evidence', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'both_genetic_and_environmental_factors', 'contribute', 'to', 'disease_development', '.']","The_exact_cause for MS remains unknown , although most_evidence supports the_hypothesis that both_genetic_and_environmental_factors contribute to disease_development .","['MS', 'most_evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'both_genetic_and_environmental_factors', 'disease_development']"
"The obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis replicates within a membrane-bound inclusion that acquires host sphingomyelin (SM), a process that is essential for replication as well as inclusion biogenesis. Previous studies demonstrate that SM is acquired by a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive vesicular trafficking pathway, although paradoxically, this pathway is dispensable for bacterial replication. This finding suggests that other lipid transport mechanisms are involved in the acquisition of host SM. In this work, we interrogated the role of specific components of BFA-sensitive and BFA-insensitive lipid trafficking pathways to define their contribution in SM acquisition during infection. We found that C. trachomatis hijacks components of both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways for SM acquisition but that the SM obtained from these separate pathways is being utilized by the pathogen in different ways. We show that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts only one of the three known BFA targets, GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition. The Arf1/GBF1-dependent pathway of SM acquisition is essential for inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not required for bacterial replication. In contrast, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts CERT, a lipid transfer protein that is a key component in non-vesicular ER to trans-Golgi trafficking of ceramide (the precursor for SM), for C. trachomatis replication. We demonstrate that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner, VAP-A, and SM synthases, SMS1 and SMS2, to the inclusion and propose that these proteins establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion. We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen redirects SM biosynthesis to its replicative niche.",We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'SM', 'acquired', 'by', 'CERT-dependent_transport', 'of', 'ceramide_and_subsequent_conversion', 'to', 'SM', 'is', 'necessary', 'for', 'C._trachomatis_replication', 'whereas', 'SM', 'acquired', 'by', 'the_GBF1-dependent_pathway', 'is', 'essential', 'for', 'inclusion_growth', 'and', 'stability', '.']",We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent_transport of ceramide_and_subsequent_conversion to SM is necessary for C._trachomatis_replication whereas SM acquired by the_GBF1-dependent_pathway is essential for inclusion_growth and stability .,"['SM', 'CERT-dependent_transport', 'ceramide_and_subsequent_conversion', 'SM', 'C._trachomatis_replication', 'SM', 'the_GBF1-dependent_pathway', 'inclusion_growth', 'stability']"
"mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF). Though we previously presented a model for how mRNA pseudoknots might activate the mechanism for −1 PRF, it did not address the question of the role that they may play in positioning the mRNA relative to the ribosome in this process [E. P. Plant, K. L. M. Jacobs, J. W. Harger, A. Meskauskas, J. L. Jacobs, J. L. Baxter, A. N. Petrov and J. D. Dinman (2003) RNA, 9, 168–174].

D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115–1127]. Here, experiments using a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’ having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model.

"The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a significant effect on global society in the early 2000s and the potential of its resurgence exists. Studies on the modes of transmission of SARS are limited though a number of outbreak studies have revealed the possible airborne route. To develop more specific and effective control strategies, we conducted a detailed mechanism-based investigation that explored the role of fomite transmission in the well-known Ward 8A outbreak. We considered three hypothetical transmission routes, i.e., the long-range airborne, fomite and combined routes, in 1,744 scenarios with combinations of some important parameters. A multi-agent model was used to predict the infection risk distributions of the three hypothetical routes. Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness. Our results reveal that under the assumed conditions, the SARS coronavirus was most possible to have spread via the combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, and that the fomite route played a non-negligible role in the transmission.",Model selection was carried out for different scenarios to compare the distributions of infection risk with that of the reported attack rates and select the hypotheses with the best fitness.,"['Model_selection', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'for', 'different_scenarios', 'to', 'compare', 'the_distributions', 'of', 'infection_risk', 'with', 'that', 'of', 'the_reported_attack_rates', 'and', 'select', 'the_hypotheses', 'with', 'the_best_fitness', '.']",Model_selection was carried out for different_scenarios to compare the_distributions of infection_risk with that of the_reported_attack_rates and select the_hypotheses with the_best_fitness .,"['Model_selection', 'different_scenarios', 'the_distributions', 'infection_risk', 'the_reported_attack_rates', 'the_hypotheses', 'the_best_fitness']"
"Transplantation of myogenic stem cells possesses great potential for long-term repair of dystrophic muscle. However, a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy. Expansion of cells ex vivo using traditional culture techniques significantly reduces engraftment potential. We hypothesized that activation of Notch signaling during ex vivo expansion would maintain donor cell engraftment potential. In this study, we expanded freshly isolated canine muscle-derived cells on tissue culture plates coated with Delta-1(ext)-IgG to activate Notch signaling or with human IgG as a control. A model of canine-to-murine xenotransplantation was used to quantitatively compare canine muscle cell engraftment, and determine if engrafted donor cells could function as satellite cells in vivo. We show that Delta-1(ext)-IgG inhibited differentiation of canine muscle-derived cells, and increased the level of genes normally expressed in myogenic precursors. Moreover, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG resulted in a significant increase in the number of donor-derived fibers, as compared to cells expanded on human IgG, reaching engraftment levels similar to freshly isolated cells. Importantly, cells expanded on Delta-1(ext)-IgG engrafted to the recipient satellite cell niche, and contributed to further regeneration. A similar strategy of expanding human muscle-derived cells on Notch ligand might facilitate engraftment and muscle regeneration for patients affected with muscular dystrophy.",We hypothesized that activation of Notch signaling during ex vivo expansion would maintain donor cell engraftment potential.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that_activation', 'of', 'Notch', 'signaling', 'during', 'ex_vivo_expansion', 'would', 'maintain', 'donor_cell_engraftment_potential', '.']",We hypothesized that_activation of Notch signaling during ex_vivo_expansion would maintain donor_cell_engraftment_potential .,"['that_activation', 'Notch', 'ex_vivo_expansion']"
"OBJECTIVE: It has proved that muscle paralysis was more protective for injured lung in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the precise mechanism is not clear. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that abdominal muscle activity during mechanically ventilation increases lung injury in severe ARDS. METHODS: Eighteen male Beagles were studied under mechanical ventilation with anesthesia. Severe ARDS was induced by repetitive oleic acid infusion. After lung injury, Beagles were randomly assigned into spontaneous breathing group (BIPAP(SB)) and abdominal muscle paralysis group (BIPAP(AP)). All groups were ventilated with BIPAP model for 8h, and the high pressure titrated to reached a tidal volume of 6ml/kg, the low pressure was set at 10 cmH(2)O, with I:E ratio 1:1, and respiratory rate adjusted to a PaCO(2) of 35–60 mmHg. Six Beagles without ventilator support comprised the control group. Respiratory variables, end-expiratory volume (EELV) and gas exchange were assessed during mechanical ventilation. The levels of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 in lung tissue and plasma were measured by qRT-PCR and ELISA respectively. Lung injury scores were determined at end of the experiment. RESULTS: For the comparable ventilator setting, as compared with BIPAP(SB) group, the BIPAP(AP) group presented higher EELV (427±47 vs. 366±38 ml) and oxygenation index (293±36 vs. 226±31 mmHg), lower levels of IL-6(216.6±48.0 vs. 297.5±71.2 pg/ml) and IL-8(246.8±78.2 vs. 357.5±69.3 pg/ml) in plasma, and lower express levels of IL-6 mRNA (15.0±3.8 vs. 21.2±3.7) and IL-8 mRNA (18.9±6.8 vs. 29.5±7.9) in lung tissues. In addition, less lung histopathology injury were revealed in the BIPAP(AP) group (22.5±2.0 vs. 25.2±2.1).

"PURPOSE: Despite their controversial role, corticosteroids (CS) are frequently administered to patients with H1N1 virus infection with severe respiratory failure secondary to viral pneumonia. We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection and that CS may contribute to this complication. METHODS: We retrospectively selected all adult patients with confirmed H1N1 virus infection admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of two tertiary care hospitals from September 2009 to March 2011. Differences in baseline factors, risk factors, and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPA. RESULTS: Of 40 critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1, 9 (23 %) developed IPA 3 days after ICU admission. Five patients had proven and four had probable IPA. Significantly more IPA patients received CS within 7 days before ICU admission (78 versus 23 %, p = 0.002). IPA patients also received significantly higher doses of CS before ICU admission [hydrocortisone equivalent 800 (360–2,635) versus 0 (0–0) mg, p = 0.005]. On multivariate analysis, use of CS before ICU admission was independently associated with IPA [odds ratio (OR) 14.4 (2.0–101.6), p = 0.007]. CONCLUSIONS: IPA was diagnosed in 23 % of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 3 days after ICU admission. Our data suggest that use of CS 7 days before ICU admission is an independent risk factor for fungal superinfection.

In the absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody or in the presence of an isotype control antibody, the EB in Matrigel underwent extensive sprouting, generating lengthy vascular structures with well-defined lumina as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. Both the length and architecture of the vascular tubes were inhibited by anti-CEACAM1 mAb CC1, a mAb that blocks the cell–cell adhesion functions of CEACAM1, thus demonstrating a critical role for this cell–cell adhesion molecule in generating and maintaining vasculogenesis. QRT–PCR analysis of the VEGF treated ES cells grown under conditions that convert them to EB revealed expression of Ceacam1 as early as −5 to −3 d reaching a maximum at day 0 at which time EBs were transferred to Matrigel, thereafter levels at first declined and then increased over time. Other markers of vasculogenesis including Pecam1, VE-Cad, and Tie-1 were not detected until day 0 when EBs were transferred to Matrigel followed by a steady increase in levels, indicating later roles in vasculogenesis. In contrast, Tie-2 and Flk-1 (VEGFR2) were detected on day five of EB formation reaching a maximum at day 0 on transfer to Matrigel, similar to Ceacam1, but after which Tie-2 declined over time, while Flk-1 increased over time. QRT–PCR analysis of the anti-CEACAM1 treated ES cells revealed a significant decrease in the expression of Ceacam1, Pecam1, Tie-1, and Flk-1, while VE-Cad and Tie-2 expression were unaffected. These results suggest that the expression and signaling of CEACAM1 may affect the expression of other factors known to play critical roles in vasculogenesis. Furthermore this 3D model of vasculogenesis in an environment of extracellular matrix may be a useful model for comparison to existing models of angiogenesis.","Based on the ability of CEACAM1 to initiate lumen formation in human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D culture (Matrigel), we hypothesized that murine CEACAM1 may play a similar role in vasculogenesis.","['Based', 'on', 'the_ability', 'of', 'CEACAM1', 'to', 'initiate', 'lumen_formation', 'in', 'human_mammary_epithelial_cells', 'grown', 'in', '3D_culture', '(', 'Matrigel', ')', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'murine_CEACAM1', 'may', 'play', 'a_similar_role', 'in', 'vasculogenesis', '.']","Based on the_ability of CEACAM1 to initiate lumen_formation in human_mammary_epithelial_cells grown in 3D_culture ( Matrigel ) , we hypothesized that murine_CEACAM1 may play a_similar_role in vasculogenesis .","['the_ability', 'CEACAM1', 'lumen_formation', 'human_mammary_epithelial_cells', 'Matrigel', 'a_similar_role', 'vasculogenesis']"
"BACKGROUND: The HIV-1 RNA genome has a biased nucleotide composition with a surplus of As. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated. The reason for this reservation is the likelihood that known and unknown sequence motifs will be affected by such a massive mutational approach, thus resulting in replication-impaired virus mutants. We present the first attempt to increase and decrease the A-count in a relatively small polymerase (pol) gene segment of HIV-1 RNA. RESULTS: To minimize the mutational impact, a new mutational approach was developed that is inspired by natural sequence variation as present in HIV-1 isolates. This phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis allowed us to create replication-competent HIV-1 mutants with a significantly increased or decreased local A-count. The local A-count of the wild-type (wt) virus (40.2%) was further increased to 46.9% or reduced to 31.7 and 26.3%. These HIV-1 variants replicate efficiently in vitro, despite the fact that the pol changes cause a quite profound move in HIV–SIV sequence space. CONCLUSIONS: Extrapolating these results to the complete 9 kb RNA genome, we may cautiously suggest that the A-rich signature does not have to be maintained. This survey also provided clues that silent codon changes, in particular from G-to-A, determine the subtype-specific sequence signatures.","Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this striking phenomenon, but the A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated.","['Several_hypotheses', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'forward', 'to', 'explain', 'this_striking_phenomenon', ',', 'but', 'the_A-count', 'of', 'the', 'HIV-1', 'genome', 'has', 'thus', 'far', 'not', 'been', 'systematically', 'manipulated', '.']","Several_hypotheses have been put forward to explain this_striking_phenomenon , but the_A-count of the HIV-1 genome has thus far not been systematically manipulated .","['Several_hypotheses', 'the_A-count', 'HIV-1']"
"BACKGROUND: Human rotavirus (HRV) is the most important cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children. Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) reduces rotavirus infection and diarrhea. However, the molecular mechanisms of LGG-mediated protection from rotavirus infection are poorly understood. Autophagy plays an essential role in responses to microbial pathogens. However, the role of autophagy in HRV infection and LGG treatment is unknown. We hypothesize that rotavirus gastroenteritis activates autophagy and that LGG suppresses virus-induced autophagy and prevents intestinal damage in infected piglets. METHODS: We used LGG feeding to combat viral gastroenteritis in the gnotobiotic pig model of virulent HRV infection. RESULTS: We found that LGG feeding did not increase autophagy, whereas virus infection induced autophagy in the piglet intestine. Virus infection increased the protein levels of the autophagy markers ATG16L1 and Beclin-1 and the autophagy regulator mTOR. LGG treatment during viral gastroenteritis reduced autophagy marker expression to normal levels, induced apoptosis and partially prevented virus-induced tissue damage. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into virus-induced autophagy and LGG suppression of uncontrolled autophagy and intestinal injury.

"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-γ) synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) to inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in vitro. To determine whether this phenomenon is shared by other herpesviruses, we investigated the effects of IFNs on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. RESULTS: We have found that as with HSV-1, IFN-γ synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN-α/β) to potently inhibit HCMV replication in vitro. While pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with IFN-α, IFN-β or IFN-γ alone inhibited HCMV plaque formation by ~30 to 40-fold, treatment with IFN-α and IFN-γ or IFN-β and IFN-γ inhibited HCMV plaque formation by 163- and 662-fold, respectively. The generation of isobole plots verified that the observed inhibition of HCMV plaque formation and replication in HFFs by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ was a synergistic interaction. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the HCMV immediate early (IE) genes (IE1 and IE2) revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with IFN-α/β and IFN-γ (~5-11-fold) as compared to vehicle-treated cells. Furthermore, decreased IE mRNA expression was accompanied by a decrease in IE protein expression, as demonstrated by western blotting and immunofluorescence. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IFN-α/β and IFN-γ synergistically inhibit HCMV replication through a mechanism that may involve the regulation of IE gene expression. We hypothesize that IFN-γ produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.",We hypothesize that IFN-γ produced by activated cells of the adaptive immune response may potentially synergize with endogenous type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV dissemination in vivo.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'IFN-γ', 'produced', 'by', 'activated_cells', 'of', 'the_adaptive_immune_response', 'may', 'potentially', 'synergize', 'with', 'endogenous_type', 'I', 'IFNs', 'to', 'inhibit', 'HCMV_dissemination', 'in', 'vivo', '.']",We hypothesize that IFN-γ produced by activated_cells of the_adaptive_immune_response may potentially synergize with endogenous_type I IFNs to inhibit HCMV_dissemination in vivo .,"['activated_cells', 'the_adaptive_immune_response', 'HCMV_dissemination', 'vivo']"
"Aging‐related decline in immunity is believed to be the main driver behind decreased vaccine efficacy and reduced resistance to infections in older adults. Unrepaired DNA damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence, which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age‐related phenotypes. Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole‐body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells. To decisively test whether and to what extent WBI in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages, we exposed young male C57BL/6 mice to sublethal WBI (0.5–4 Gy), mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe. We followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age. None of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock‐irradiated (0 Gy) animals for the parameters measured. Even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal WBI in youth (4 Gy) exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis, robust T‐ and B‐cell responses to live attenuated West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal WNV challenge. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model.","Unrepaired DNA damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence, which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age‐related phenotypes.","['Unrepaired_DNA_damage', 'is', 'known', 'to', 'precipitate', 'cellular_senescence', ',', 'which', 'was', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'be', 'the_underlying_cause', 'of', 'certain_age‐related_phenotypes', '.']","Unrepaired_DNA_damage is known to precipitate cellular_senescence , which was hypothesized to be the_underlying_cause of certain_age‐related_phenotypes .","['Unrepaired_DNA_damage', 'cellular_senescence', 'the_underlying_cause', 'certain_age‐related_phenotypes']"
"Abstract Background A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.","The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely.","['The_levels', 'of', 'genetic_similarity', 'between', 'the_2019-nCoV', 'and', 'RaTG13', 'suggest', 'that', 'the', 'latter', 'does', 'not', 'provide', 'the_exact_variant', 'that', 'caused', 'the_outbreak', 'in', 'humans', ',', 'but', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', '2019-nCoV', 'has', 'originated', 'from', 'bats', 'is', 'very', 'likely', '.']","The_levels of genetic_similarity between the_2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the_exact_variant that caused the_outbreak in humans , but the_hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely .","['The_levels', 'genetic_similarity', 'the_2019-nCoV', 'RaTG13', 'the_outbreak', 'humans', 'the_hypothesis', '2019-nCoV', 'bats']"
"BACKGROUND: Geographic variables play an important role in the study of epidemics. The role of one such variable, population density, in the spread of influenza is controversial. Prior studies have tested for such a role using arbitrary thresholds for population density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher or lower mortality. The results of such studies are mixed. The objective of this study is to estimate, rather than assume, a threshold level of population density that separates low-density regions from high-density regions on the basis of population loss during an influenza pandemic. We study the case of the influenza pandemic of 1918–19 in India, where over 15 million people died in the short span of less than one year. METHODS: Using data from six censuses for 199 districts of India (n=1194), the country with the largest number of deaths from the influenza of 1918–19, we use a sample-splitting method embedded within a population growth model that explicitly quantifies population loss from the pandemic to estimate a threshold level of population density that separates low-density districts from high-density districts. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a threshold level of population density of 175 people per square mile. A concurrent finding is that districts on the low side of the threshold experienced rates of population loss (3.72%) that were lower than districts on the high side of the threshold (4.69%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper introduces a useful analytic tool to the health geographic literature. It illustrates an application of the tool to demonstrate that it can be useful for pandemic awareness and preparedness efforts. Specifically, it estimates a level of population density above which policies to socially distance, redistribute or quarantine populations are likely to be more effective than they are for areas with population densities that lie below the threshold.",Prior studies have tested for such a role using arbitrary thresholds for population density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher or lower mortality.,"['Prior_studies', 'have', 'tested', 'for', 'such_a_role', 'using', 'arbitrary_thresholds', 'for', 'population_density', 'above', 'or', 'below', 'which', 'places', 'are', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'have', 'higher_or_lower_mortality', '.']",Prior_studies have tested for such_a_role using arbitrary_thresholds for population_density above or below which places are hypothesized to have higher_or_lower_mortality .,"['Prior_studies', 'such_a_role', 'arbitrary_thresholds', 'population_density', 'places', 'higher_or_lower_mortality']"
"The molecular mechanisms mediating herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gene silencing during latent infection are not clear. Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression. Transient co-transfection assays indicated that Egr-1 negatively regulated the transcription of both full-length and intron-removed ICP22 promoters. The same assays also revealed that Egr-1 repressed ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4) promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but showed less inhibition when the intron was removed. Histone deacetylation was not involved in this regulation since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not exhibit any effect on Egr-1-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Egr-1 reduced the binding of Sp1 to the promoters and that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 in the presence of Egr-1. These results suggested that the multifunctional transcription factor Egr-1 can repress HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression through the recruitment of co-repressor Nab2 and reduction of Sp1 occupancy, and thus may play a critical role in HSV-1 gene silencing during latency.","Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression.","['Five_copies', 'of', 'early_growth_response_gene', '1_(Egr-1)_binding_elements', 'were', 'identified', 'in', 'the_intron', 'of', 'HSV-1', 'ICP22', '(', 'infected', 'cell', 'protein', 'No._22)_gene', ',', 'leading', 'to', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'Egr-1', 'binds', 'to', 'the_viral_genome', 'and', 'regulates', 'the_viral_gene_expression', '.']","Five_copies of early_growth_response_gene 1_(Egr-1)_binding_elements were identified in the_intron of HSV-1 ICP22 ( infected cell protein No._22)_gene , leading to the_hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the_viral_genome and regulates the_viral_gene_expression .","['Five_copies', 'early_growth_response_gene', 'the_intron', 'HSV-1', '( infected cell protein', 'No._22)_gene', 'the_hypothesis', 'Egr-1', 'the_viral_gene_expression']"
"The azurophilic granules of human neutrophils contain four α-defensins called human neutrophil peptides (HNPs 1–4). HNPs are tridisulfide-linked antimicrobial peptides involved in the intracellular killing of organisms phagocytosed by neutrophils. The peptides are produced as inactive precursors (proHNPs) which are processed to active microbicides by as yet unidentified convertases. ProHNP1 was expressed in E. coli and the affinity-purified propeptide isolated as two species, one containing mature HNP1 sequence with native disulfide linkages (“folded proHNP1”) and the other containing non-native disulfide linked proHNP1 conformers (misfolded proHNP1). Native HNP1, liberated by CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1, was microbicidal against Staphylococcus aureus, but the peptide derived from misfolded proHNP1 was inactive. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension. NE and PR3 cleaved folded proHNP1 to produce a peptide indistinguishable from native HNP1 purified from neutrophils, and the microbicidal activities of in vitro derived and natural HNP1 peptides were equivalent. In contrast, misfolded proHNP1 conformers were degraded extensively under the same conditions. Thus, NE and PR3 possess proHNP1 convertase activity that requires the presence of the native HNP1 disulfide motif for high fidelity activation of the precursor in vitro.","We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG)","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that_neutrophil_elastase', '(', 'NE', ')', ',', 'proteinase', '3', '(PR3', ')', 'or', 'cathepsin_G', '(CG', ')']","We hypothesized that_neutrophil_elastase ( NE ) , proteinase 3 (PR3 ) or cathepsin_G (CG )","['that_neutrophil_elastase', '( NE', ', proteinase 3 (PR3', 'cathepsin_G', '(CG']"
"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most devastating and costly diseases to the swine industry worldwide. Overall, the adaptive immune response to PRRS virus (PRRSV) is weak, which results in delayed elimination of virus from the host and inferior vaccine protection. PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response. To test this, we measured both antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs after the administration of a nonreplicating human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing porcine IFN-α (Ad5–pIFN-α) at the time of PRRSV infection and compared the results to those for pigs infected with PRRSV alone. Viremia was delayed, and there was a decrease in viral load in the sera of pigs administered the Ad5–pIFN-α. Although seroconversion was slightly delayed in pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, probably due to the early reduction in viral replication, little difference in the overall or neutralizing antibody response was seen. However, there was an increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells detected in the pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, as well as an altered cytokine profile in the lung at 14 days postinfection, indicating that the presence of IFN-α at the time of infection can alter innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV.","PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response.","['PRRSV', 'has', 'been', 'shown', 'to', 'induce', 'a_meager_alpha_interferon_(IFN-α)_response', ',', 'and', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'elevated_IFN-α_levels', 'early', 'in', 'infection', 'would', 'shorten', 'the_induction_time', 'and', 'increase', 'elements', 'of', 'the_adaptive_immune_response', '.']","PRRSV has been shown to induce a_meager_alpha_interferon_(IFN-α)_response , and we hypothesized that elevated_IFN-α_levels early in infection would shorten the_induction_time and increase elements of the_adaptive_immune_response .","['PRRSV', 'elevated_IFN-α_levels', 'infection', 'the_induction_time', 'elements', 'the_adaptive_immune_response']"
"Interferon induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) found in vertebrates restrict infections by specific viruses. IFITM3 is known to be essential for restriction of influenza virus infections in both mice and humans. Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote. Since bacterial IFITMs share minimal amino acid identity with human IFITM3, we hypothesized that examination of bacterial IFITMs in human cells would provide insight into the essential characteristics necessary for antiviral activity of IFITMs. We examined IFITMs from Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium abscessus for potential antiviral activity. Both of these IFITMs conferred a moderate level of resistance to influenza virus in human cells, identifying them as functional homologues of IFITM3. Analysis of sequence elements shared by bacterial IFITMs and IFITM3 identified two hydrophobic domains, putative S-palmitoylation sites, and conserved phenylalanine residues associated with IFITM3 interactions, which are all necessary for IFITM3 antiviral activity. We observed that, like IFITM3, bacterial IFITMs were S-palmitoylated, albeit to a lesser degree. We also demonstrated the ability of a bacterial IFITM to co-immunoprecipitate with IFITM3 suggesting formation of a complex, and also visualized strong co-localization of bacterial IFITMs with IFITM3. However, the mycobacterial IFITMs lack the endocytic-targeting motif conserved in vertebrate IFITM3. As such, these bacterial proteins, when expressed alone, had diminished colocalization with cathepsin B-positive endolysosomal compartments that are the primary site of IFITM3-dependent influenza virus restriction. Though the precise evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs is not known, our results support a model whereby transfer of a bacterial IFITM gene to eukaryotic cells may have provided a selective advantage against viral infection that was refined through the course of vertebrate evolution to include more robust signals for S-palmitoylation and localization to sites of endocytic virus trafficking.",Vertebrate IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a primitive unicellular eukaryote.,"['Vertebrate_IFITMs', 'are', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'have', 'derived', 'from', 'a_horizontal_gene_transfer', 'from', 'bacteria', 'to', 'a_primitive_unicellular_eukaryote', '.']",Vertebrate_IFITMs are hypothesized to have derived from a_horizontal_gene_transfer from bacteria to a_primitive_unicellular_eukaryote .,"['Vertebrate_IFITMs', 'a_horizontal_gene_transfer', 'bacteria', 'a_primitive_unicellular_eukaryote']"
"Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are quickly becoming a useful model for infectious disease and transplantation research. Even though cynomolgus macaques from different geographic regions are used for these studies, there has been limited characterization of full-length major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I immunogenetics of distinct geographic populations. Here, we identified 48 MHC class I cDNA nucleotide sequences in eleven Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, including 41 novel Mafa-A and Mafa-B sequences. We found seven MHC class I sequences in Indonesian macaques that were identical to MHC class I sequences identified in Malaysian or Mauritian macaques. Sharing of nucleotide sequences between these geographically distinct populations is also consistent with the hypothesis that Indonesia was a source of the Mauritian macaque population. In addition, we found that the Indonesian cDNA sequence Mafa-B*7601 is identical throughout its peptide binding domain to Mamu-B*03, an allele that has been associated with control of Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) viremia in Indian rhesus macaques.

"Premature infants are at risk for lower airway obstruction; however, maturation of reflex pathways regulating lower airway patency is inadequately studied. We hypothesized that postnatal maturation causes developmental change in brainstem efferent airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) within the rostral nucleus ambiguus (rNA) that project to the airways, and in pulmonary afferent fibers that terminate in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Ferrets aged 7, 14, 21 and 42 days received intrapulmonary injection of Cholera toxin β subunit (CT-b), a transganglionic retrograde tracer. Five days later, their brainstem was processed for dual immunolabeling of CT-b and the cholinergic marker, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT). CT-b labeled AVPNs and CT-b labeled afferent fiber optical density were analyzed. There was a significantly higher CT-b labeled cell number within the rNA at the youngest compared to older ages. All efferent CT-b labeled cells expressed ChAT. Optical density of CT-b labeled afferent fibers was also higher at 7 compared to 14 days. We conclude that the number of efferent AVPNs and afferent fiber optical density both diminish over the second postnatal week. We speculate that exposure to injurious agents in early postnatal life may inhibit natural remodeling and thereby enhance later vulnerability to airway hyperreactivity.",We hypothesized that postnatal maturation causes developmental change in brainstem efferent airway-related vagal preganglionic neurons (AVPNs) within the rostral nucleus ambiguus,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'postnatal_maturation', 'causes', 'developmental_change', 'in', 'brainstem_efferent_airway-related_vagal_preganglionic_neurons', '(', 'AVPNs', ')', 'within', 'the_rostral_nucleus', 'ambiguus']",We hypothesized that postnatal_maturation causes developmental_change in brainstem_efferent_airway-related_vagal_preganglionic_neurons ( AVPNs ) within the_rostral_nucleus ambiguus,"['postnatal_maturation', 'causes', 'developmental_change', 'brainstem_efferent_airway-related_vagal_preganglionic_neurons', '( AVPNs', 'the_rostral_nucleus ambiguus']"
"BACKGROUND: The cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) has been increasingly used as a non-human primate model in biomedical research. As establishing baseline thoracic radiography for the cynomolgus monkey is essential, we tested the hypothesis that age and sex may affect the thoracic radiography parameters of this species. METHODS: Here, 697 healthy cynomolgus monkeys were segregated by sex and age (three age groups: 25–36 months, 37–48 months, 49–60 months). The lung length (LL), maximal interior thoracic depth (TD), maximal interior thoracic breadth (TBr), cardiac silhouette breadth (CBr), cardiothoracic ratio (CR), right and left costophrenic angles (RCA and LCA), and right hilar height ratio (R-HHR) were assessed by chest film. Statistical analysis was applied to examine the effect of age, sex, and age × sex interactions. RESULTS: Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age × sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49–60 months. CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups. CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups, and CR was similar or slightly higher relative to those previously found in other non-human primate species. As to the other parameters with no significant sex nor age-related differences, the R-HHR was greater than 1.00, and the angulation of bilateral costophrenic angles were sharp.

"BACKGROUND: Infection with Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) causes vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration in young pigs. The virus made its first appearance in the U.S. in 2013, where it caused substantial neonatal mortality and economic losses in the U.S. pork industry. Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces. This potential risk created a demand for research on the inactivation kinetics of PEDV in different environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of PEDV in 9 different feed ingredients when exposed to 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C, as well as the survival on four different surfaces (galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic). RESULTS: Overall, there were no differences (P > 0.05) in virus survival among the different feed matrices studied when thermally processed at 60 to 90 °C for 5, 10, 15, or 30 min. However, the time necessary to achieve a one log reduction in virus concentration was less (P < 0.05) when ingredients were exposed to temperatures from 70 °C (3.7 min), 80 °C (2.4 min), and 90 °C (2.3 min) compared with 60 °C (4.4 min). The maximum inactivation level (3.9 log) was achieved when heating all ingredients at 90 °C for 30 min. There were no differences in the amount of time necessary to cause a one log reduction in PEDV concentration among the different surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that PEDV survival among the 9 feed ingredients evaluated was not different when exposed to thermal treatments for up to 30 min. However, different combinations of temperature and time resulted in achieving a 3 to 4 log reduction of PEDV in all feed ingredients evaluated. Finally, PEDV survival was similar on galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum and plastic.","Based on outbreak investigations, it is hypothesized that the virus could be transmitted through contaminated feed or contaminated feed surfaces.","['Based', 'on', 'outbreak_investigations', ',', 'it', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_virus', 'could', 'be', 'transmitted', 'through', 'contaminated_feed', 'or', 'contaminated_feed_surfaces', '.']","Based on outbreak_investigations , it is hypothesized that the_virus could be transmitted through contaminated_feed or contaminated_feed_surfaces .","['outbreak_investigations', 'the_virus', 'contaminated_feed', 'contaminated_feed_surfaces']"
"BACKGROUND: FTY720 (fingolimod) is the first oral drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with the relapsing-remitting form of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. Evidence suggests that the therapeutic benefit of FTY720 occurs by preventing the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes thereby inhibiting the infiltration of disease-causing lymphocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease. METHODS: Mice were infected intracranially with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Infected animals were treated with increasing doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) of FTY720 and morbidity and mortality recorded. Infiltration of inflammatory virus-specific T cells (tetramer staining) into the CNS of FTY720-treated mice was determined using flow cytometry. The effects of FTY720 treatment on virus-specific T cell proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity were also determined. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in FTY720-treated mice was examined by flow cytometry and histopathologically, respectively, in the spinal cords of the mice. RESULTS: Administration of FTY720 to JHMV-infected mice resulted in increased clinical disease severity and mortality. These results correlated with impaired ability to control viral replication (P < 0.05) within the CNS at days 7 and 14 post-infection, which was associated with diminished accumulation of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.05) into the CNS. Reduced neuroinflammation in FTY720-treated mice correlated with increased retention of T lymphocytes within draining cervical lymph nodes (P < 0.05). Treatment with FTY720 did not affect virus-specific T cell proliferation, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α or cytolytic activity. FTY720-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the severity of demyelination associated with dampened neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that FTY720 mutes effective anti-viral immune responses through impacting migration and accumulation of virus-specific T cells within the CNS during acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis. FTY720 treatment reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory-mediated demyelination by restricting the access of disease-causing lymphocytes into the CNS but is not associated with viral recrudescence in this model.",We hypothesized that FTY720 treatment would affect lymphocyte migration to the CNS and influence disease severity in a mouse model of viral-induced neurologic disease.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'FTY720_treatment', 'would', 'affect', 'lymphocyte_migration', 'to', 'the_CNS_and_influence_disease_severity', 'in', 'a_mouse_model', 'of', 'viral-induced_neurologic_disease', '.']",We hypothesized that FTY720_treatment would affect lymphocyte_migration to the_CNS_and_influence_disease_severity in a_mouse_model of viral-induced_neurologic_disease .,"['FTY720_treatment', 'lymphocyte_migration', 'the_CNS_and_influence_disease_severity', 'a_mouse_model', 'viral-induced_neurologic_disease']"
"Previous results suggested that, after intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus, entered the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization. Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion. MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain. Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways.","To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization.","['To', 'prove', 'this_hypothesis', ',', 'the_effect', 'of', 'interruption', 'of', 'the_olfactory_pathway', 'on', 'spread', 'of', 'the_virus', 'was', 'studied', 'using', 'in', 'situ_hybridization', '.']","To prove this_hypothesis , the_effect of interruption of the_olfactory_pathway on spread of the_virus was studied using in situ_hybridization .","['the_effect', 'interruption', 'the_olfactory_pathway', 'spread', 'the_virus', 'situ_hybridization']"
"The mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group (MTBFG) contains viruses associated with important human and animal diseases such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever. In contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses where recombination events are frequent, the evolutionary dynamic within the MTBFG was believed to be essentially clonal. This assumption was challenged with the recent report of several homologous recombinations within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). We performed a thorough analysis of publicly available genomes in this group and found no compelling evidence for the previously identified recombinations. However, our results show for the first time that demonstrable recombination (i.e., with large statistical support and strong phylogenetic evidences) has occurred in the MTBFG, more specifically within the Louping ill virus lineage. Putative parents, recombinant strains and breakpoints were further tested for statistical significance using phylogenetic methods. We investigated the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a Bayesian framework. The recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of 282 to 76 years before the present. By unravelling the temporal setting of the event, we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account for the observed recombination.","By unravelling the temporal setting of the event, we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account for the observed recombination.","['By', 'unravelling', 'the_temporal_setting', 'of', 'the_event', ',', 'we', 'adduce', 'hypotheses', 'about', 'the_ecological_conditions', 'that', 'could', 'account', 'for', 'the_observed_recombination', '.']","By unravelling the_temporal_setting of the_event , we adduce hypotheses about the_ecological_conditions that could account for the_observed_recombination .","['the_temporal_setting', 'the_event', 'hypotheses', 'the_ecological_conditions', 'the_observed_recombination']"
"Comorbidities that promote the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain to be uncovered and evaluated in animal models. Because elderly individuals are vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections, these microbial agents may be considered important comorbidities that could potentiate an already existing and tenuous inflammatory condition in the brain, accelerating cognitive decline, particularly if the cellular and molecular mechanisms can be defined. Researchers have recently demonstrated that triggering inflammation in the brain exacerbates tau pathological characteristics in animal models. Herein, we explore whether inflammation induced via viral infection, compared with inflammation induced via bacterial lipopolysaccharide, modulates AD-like pathological features in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infectious agents may act as a comorbidity for AD. Our study shows that infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation significantly exacerbates tau pathological characteristics, with chronic inflammation leading to impairments in spatial memory. Tau phosphorylation was increased via a glycogen synthase kinase-3β–dependent mechanism, and there was a prominent shift of tau from the detergent-soluble to the detergent-insoluble fraction. During chronic inflammation, we found that inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β activity with lithium reduced tau phosphorylation and the accumulation of insoluble tau and reversed memory impairments. Taken together, infectious agents that trigger central nervous system inflammation may serve as a comorbidity for AD, leading to cognitive impairments by a mechanism that involves exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics.","Herein, we explore whether inflammation induced via viral infection, compared with inflammation induced via bacterial lipopolysaccharide, modulates AD-like pathological features in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infectious agents may act as a comorbidity for AD.","['Herein', ',', 'we', 'explore', 'whether', 'inflammation', 'induced', 'via', 'viral_infection', ',', 'compared', 'with', 'inflammation', 'induced', 'via', 'bacterial_lipopolysaccharide', ',', 'modulates', 'AD-like_pathological_features', 'in', 'the_3xTg-AD_mouse_model', 'and', 'provide', 'evidence', 'to', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'infectious_agents', 'may', 'act', 'as', 'a_comorbidity', 'for', 'AD', '.']","Herein , we explore whether inflammation induced via viral_infection , compared with inflammation induced via bacterial_lipopolysaccharide , modulates AD-like_pathological_features in the_3xTg-AD_mouse_model and provide evidence to support the_hypothesis that infectious_agents may act as a_comorbidity for AD .","['Herein', 'inflammation', 'viral_infection', 'inflammation', 'bacterial_lipopolysaccharide', 'AD-like_pathological_features', 'the_3xTg-AD_mouse_model', 'evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'infectious_agents', 'a_comorbidity', 'AD']"
"BACKGROUND: The cellular proteins Pat1p, Lsm1p, and Dhh1p are required for the replication of some positive-strand viruses and therefore are potential targets for new antiviral drugs. To prioritize host targets for antiviral drug screening a comparative metabolome analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reference strain BY4742 Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 and deletion strains pat1Δ, lsm1Δ and dhh1Δ was performed. RESULTS: GC/MS analysis permitted the quantification of 47 polar metabolites and the identification of 41 of them. Metabolites with significant variation between the strains were identified using partial least squares to latent structures discriminate analysis (PLS-DA). The analysis revealed least differences of pat1Δ to the reference strain as characterized by Euclidian distance of normalized peak areas. The growth rate and specific production rates of ethanol and glycerol were also most similar with this strain.

"Abstract Vpu, a component unique to HIV-1, greatly enhances the efficiency of viral particle release by unclear mechanisms. This Vpu function is intrinsically linked to its channel-like structure, which enables it to interfere with homologous transmembrane structures in infected cells. Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K+ channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane. Here, we found that the efficiency of Vpu-mediated viral release is inversely correlated with membrane potential polarization. By inhibiting the background K+ currents, Vpu dissipates the voltage constraint on viral particle discharge. As a proof of concept, we show that HIV-1 release can be accelerated by externally imposed depolarization alone. Our findings identify the trigger of Vpu-mediated release as a manifestation of the general principle of depolarization-stimulated exocytosis.","Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K+ channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane.","['Because', 'Vpu', 'interacts', 'destructively', 'with', 'host_background_K+_channels', 'that', 'set', 'the_cell_resting_potential', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'Vpu', 'might', 'trigger', 'viral_release', 'by', 'destabilizing', 'the_electric_field', 'across', 'a_budding_membrane', '.']","Because Vpu interacts destructively with host_background_K+_channels that set the_cell_resting_potential , we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral_release by destabilizing the_electric_field across a_budding_membrane .","['Vpu', 'host_background_K+_channels', 'Vpu', 'viral_release', 'destabilizing the_electric_field', 'a_budding_membrane']"
"BACKGROUND: Acute lower respiratory infections are the commonest cause of morbidity and potentially preventable mortality in Indigenous infants. Infancy is also a critical time for post-natal lung growth and development. Severe or repeated lower airway injury in very young children likely increases the likelihood of chronic pulmonary disorders later in life. Globally, bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. Compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. Our study tests the hypothesis that the anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin, improve the clinical outcomes of Indigenous Australian infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. METHODS: We are conducting a dual centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial in northern Australia. Indigenous infants (aged ≤ 24-months, expected number = 200) admitted to one of two regional hospitals (Darwin, Northern Territory and Townsville, Queensland) with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation concealed) to either azithromycin (30 mg/kg/dose) or placebo administered once weekly for three doses. Clinical data are recorded twice daily and nasopharyngeal swab are collected at enrolment and at the time of discharge from hospital. Primary outcomes are 'length of oxygen requirement' and 'duration of stay,' the latter based upon being judged as 'ready for respiratory discharge'. The main secondary outcome is readmission for a respiratory illness within 6-months of leaving hospital. Descriptive virological and bacteriological (including development of antibiotic resistance) data from nasopharyngeal samples will also be reported. DISCUSSION: Two published studies, both involving different patient populations and settings, as well as different macrolide antibiotics and treatment duration, have produced conflicting results. Our randomised, placebo-controlled trial of azithromycin in Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis is designed to determine whether it can reduce short-term (and potentially long-term) morbidity from respiratory illness in Australian Indigenous infants who are at high risk of developing chronic respiratory illness. If azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the morbidly of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis, the intervention would lead to improved short term (and possibly long term) health benefits.

"BACKGROUND: Whether information sources influence health protective behaviours during influenza pandemics or other emerging infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. METHODOLOGY: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (β = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (β = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (β = 0.19 and β = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (β = −0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (β = −0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (β = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy.

"The viral protein U (Vpu) encoded by HIV-1 has been shown to assist in the detachment of virion particles from infected cells. Vpu forms cation-specific ion channels in host cells, and has been proposed as a potential drug target. An understanding of the mechanism of ion transport through Vpu is desirable, but remains limited because of the unavailability of an experimental structure of the channel. Using a structure of the pentameric form of Vpu – modeled and validated based on available experimental data – umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations (cumulative simulation time of more than 0.4 µs) were employed to elucidate the energetics and the molecular mechanism of ion transport in Vpu. Free energy profiles corresponding to the permeation of Na(+) and K(+) were found to be similar to each other indicating lack of ion selection, consistent with previous experimental studies. The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments. A two-dimensional free energy landscape has been computed to model multiple ion permeation, based on which a mechanism for ion conduction is proposed. It is shown that only one ion can pass through the channel at a time. This, along with a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the transmembrane domain of Vpu, explains the slow kinetics of ion conduction. The results are consistent with previous conductance studies that showed Vpu to be a weakly conducting ion channel.","The Ser23 residue is shown to enhance ion transport via two mechanisms: creating a weak binding site, and increasing the effective hydrophilic length of the channel, both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments.","['The_Ser23_residue', 'is', 'shown', 'to', 'enhance', 'ion_transport', 'via', 'two_mechanisms', ':', 'creating', 'a_weak_binding_site', ',', 'and', 'increasing', 'the_effective_hydrophilic_length', 'of', 'the_channel', ',', 'both', 'of', 'which', 'have', 'previously', 'been', 'hypothesized', 'in', 'experiments', '.']","The_Ser23_residue is shown to enhance ion_transport via two_mechanisms : creating a_weak_binding_site , and increasing the_effective_hydrophilic_length of the_channel , both of which have previously been hypothesized in experiments .","['The_Ser23_residue', 'ion_transport', 'two_mechanisms', 'a_weak_binding_site', 'the_effective_hydrophilic_length', 'the_channel', 'experiments']"
"BACKGROUND: Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major problem for global public health. Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg “window stage”, active immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) might initiate effective host immune responses versus HBV to achieve functional cure of CHB. METHODS: Two experimental mouse models that mice hydrodynamic injected HBV DNA or infected with recombinant AAV/HBV were used. The “sandwich” therapeutic effect by using a potent human anti-HBsAg neutralizing monoclonal antibody (G12) in combination with antiviral drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), followed by active immunization with HBsAg-HBsAb (mYIC) was evaluated. FINDINGS: A single G12 injection rapidly cleared serum HBsAg in HDI-HBV carrier mice, with a synergistic effect in decreasing viral DNA load when TDF was given orally. When both serum viral DNA and HBsAg load became low or undetectable, mYIC was administered. A more effective clearance of viral DNA and HBsAg was observed and serum HBsAb was developed only in these “sandwich”-treated mice. Efficient intrahepatic anti-HBV immune responses were also observed in these mice, including the formation of aggregates of myeloid cells with CD8(+)T cells and increased TNF-α, granzyme B production. INTERPRETATION: The “sandwich” combination therapy not only efficiently decreased HBsAg and HBV DNA levels but also induced effective cellular and humoral immunity, which may result in functional cure of CHB.","Viral persistence and immune defects are the two major reasons for CHB, and it was hypothesized that based on a transient clearance of serum viral DNA and HBsAg","['Viral_persistence', 'and', 'immune_defects', 'are', 'the_two_major_reasons', 'for', 'CHB', ',', 'and', 'it', 'was', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'based', 'on', 'a_transient_clearance', 'of', 'serum_viral_DNA', 'and', 'HBsAg']","Viral_persistence and immune_defects are the_two_major_reasons for CHB , and it was hypothesized that based on a_transient_clearance of serum_viral_DNA and HBsAg","['Viral_persistence', 'immune_defects', 'the_two_major_reasons', 'CHB', 'a_transient_clearance', 'serum_viral_DNA', 'and HBsAg']"
"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, lethal complication of measles caused by particular mutants of measles virus (MeV) that persist in the brain despite high levels of neutralizing antibodies. We addressed the hypothesis that antigenic drift is involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SSPE by analyzing antigenic alterations in the MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein (MeV-H) found in patients with SSPE in relation to major circulating MeV genotypes. To this aim, we obtained cDNA for the MeV-H gene from tissue taken at brain autopsy from 3 deceased persons with SSPE who had short (3–4 months, SMa79), average (3.5 years, SMa84), and long (18 years, SMa94) disease courses. Recombinant MeVs with a substituted MeV-H gene were generated by a reverse genetic system. Virus neutralization assays with a panel of anti-MeV-H murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or vaccine-immunized mouse anti-MeV-H polyclonal sera were performed to determine the antigenic relatedness. Functional and receptor-binding analysis of the SSPE MeV-H showed activity in a SLAM/nectin-4–dependent manner. Similar to our panel of wild-type viruses, our SSPE viruses showed an altered antigenic profile. Genotypes A, G3, and F (SSPE case SMa79) were the exception, with an intact antigenic structure. Genotypes D7 and F (SSPE SMa79) showed enhanced neutralization by mAbs targeting antigenic site IIa. Genotypes H1 and the recently reported D4.2 were the most antigenically altered genotypes. Epitope mapping of neutralizing mAbs BH015 and BH130 reveal a new antigenic site on MeV-H, which we designated Φ for its intermediate position between previously defined antigenic sites Ia and Ib. We conclude that SSPE-causing viruses show similar antigenic properties to currently circulating MeV genotypes. The absence of a direct correlation between antigenic changes and predisposition of a certain genotype to cause SSPE does not lend support to the proposed antigenic drift as a pathogenetic mechanism in SSPE.",We addressed the hypothesis that antigenic drift is involved in the pathogenetic mechanism of SSPE by analyzing antigenic alterations in the MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein (MeV-H) found in patients with SSPE in relation to major circulating MeV genotypes.,"['We', 'addressed', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'antigenic_drift', 'is', 'involved', 'in', 'the_pathogenetic_mechanism', 'of', 'SSPE', 'by', 'analyzing', 'antigenic_alterations', 'in', 'the_MeV_envelope_hemagglutinin_protein', '(', 'MeV-H', ')', 'found', 'in', 'patients', 'with', 'SSPE', 'in', 'relation', 'to', 'major_circulating_MeV_genotypes', '.']",We addressed the_hypothesis that antigenic_drift is involved in the_pathogenetic_mechanism of SSPE by analyzing antigenic_alterations in the_MeV_envelope_hemagglutinin_protein ( MeV-H ) found in patients with SSPE in relation to major_circulating_MeV_genotypes .,"['the_hypothesis', 'antigenic_drift', 'the_pathogenetic_mechanism', 'SSPE', 'antigenic_alterations', '( MeV-H', 'patients', 'SSPE', 'relation', 'major_circulating_MeV_genotypes']"
"Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary events, heart and renal failure, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II. An “alternate” arm of the RAS now exists in which ACE2 counterbalances the effects of the classic RAS through degradation of Ang II, and generation of the vasodilator Ang 1-7. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. The catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding, resulting in ACE2 in the circulation. The ACE2 gene maps to a quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome in three strains of genetically hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACE2 may be a candidate gene for hypertension. It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension. Experimental hypertension studies have measured ACE2 in either the heart or kidney and/or plasma, and have reported that deletion or inhibition of ACE2 leads to hypertension, whilst enhancing ACE2 protects against the development of hypertension, hence increasing ACE2 may be a therapeutic option for the management of high blood pressure in man. There have been relatively few studies of ACE2, either at the gene or the circulating level in patients with hypertension. Plasma ACE2 activity is low in healthy subjects, but elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease. Genetic studies have investigated ACE2 gene polymorphisms with either hypertension or blood pressure, and have produced largely inconsistent findings. This review discusses the evidence regarding ACE2 in experimental hypertension models and the association between circulating ACE2 activity and ACE2 polymorphisms with blood pressure and arterial hypertension in man.","It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension.","['It', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'disruption', 'of', 'tissue_ACE/ACE2_balance', 'results', 'in', 'changes', 'in', 'blood_pressure', ',', 'with', 'increased_ACE2_expression', 'protecting', 'against', 'increased_blood_pressure', ',', 'and', 'ACE2', 'deficiency', 'contributing', 'to', 'hypertension', '.']","It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue_ACE/ACE2_balance results in changes in blood_pressure , with increased_ACE2_expression protecting against increased_blood_pressure , and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension .","['disruption', 'tissue_ACE', '/ACE2_balance', 'results', 'changes', 'blood_pressure', 'increased_ACE2_expression', 'increased_blood_pressure', 'ACE2 deficiency', 'hypertension']"

A general denominator is that two “morphotypes” of membrane alterations can be found that are exemplified by flaviviruses and hepaciviruses: membrane invaginations towards the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and double membrane vesicles, representing extrusions also originating from the ER, respectively. We hypothesize that either morphotype might reflect common pathways and principles that are used by these viruses to form their membranous replication compartments.",We hypothesize that either morphotype might reflect common pathways and principles that are used by these viruses to form their membranous replication compartments.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'either_morphotype', 'might', 'reflect', 'common_pathways', 'and', 'principles', 'that', 'are', 'used', 'by', 'these_viruses', 'to', 'form', 'their_membranous_replication_compartments', '.']",We hypothesize that either_morphotype might reflect common_pathways and principles that are used by these_viruses to form their_membranous_replication_compartments .,"['either_morphotype', 'common_pathways', 'principles', 'these_viruses', 'their_membranous_replication_compartments']"
"Many viruses, including herpes simplex (HSV), are recruited to their host cells via interaction between their envelope glycoproteins and cell-surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This initial attachment is of a multivalent nature, i.e., it requires the establishment of multiple bonds between amino acids of viral glycoproteins and sulfated saccharides on the GAG chain. To gain understanding of how this binding process is modulated, we performed binding kinetics and mobility studies using end-grafted GAG chains that mimic the end attachment of these chains to proteoglycans. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was used to probe binding and release, as well as the diffusion of single HSV-1 particles. To verify the hypothesis that the degree of sulfation, but also the arrangement of sulfate groups along the GAG chain, plays a key role in HSV binding, we tested two native GAGs (chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) and compared our results to chemically sulfated hyaluronan. HSV-1 recognized all sulfated GAGs, but not the nonsulfated hyaluronan, indicating that binding is specific to the presence of sulfate groups. Furthermore we observed that a notable fraction of GAG-bound virions exhibit lateral mobility, although the multivalent binding to the immobilized GAG brushes ensures firm virus attachment to the interface. Diffusion was faster on the two native GAGs, one of which, chondroitin sulfate, was also characterized by the highest association rate per GAG chain. This highlights the complexity of multivalent virus-GAG interactions and suggests that the spatial arrangement of sulfates along native GAG chains may play a role in modulating the characteristics of the HSV-GAG interaction. Altogether, these results, obtained with a minimal and well-controlled model of the cell membrane, provide, to our knowledge, new insights into the dynamics of the HSV-GAG interaction.","To verify the hypothesis that the degree of sulfation, but also the arrangement of sulfate groups along the GAG chain, plays a key role in HSV binding, we tested two native GAGs (chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate) and compared our results to chemically sulfated hyaluronan.","['To', 'verify', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_degree', 'of', 'sulfation', ',', 'but', 'also', 'the_arrangement', 'of', 'sulfate_groups', 'along', 'the_GAG_chain', ',', 'plays', 'a_key_role', 'in', 'HSV_binding', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'two_native_GAGs', '(', 'chondroitin_sulfate', 'and', 'heparan', 'sulfate', ')', 'and', 'compared', 'our_results', 'to', 'chemically', 'sulfated', 'hyaluronan', '.']","To verify the_hypothesis that the_degree of sulfation , but also the_arrangement of sulfate_groups along the_GAG_chain , plays a_key_role in HSV_binding , we tested two_native_GAGs ( chondroitin_sulfate and heparan sulfate ) and compared our_results to chemically sulfated hyaluronan .","['the_hypothesis', 'the_degree', 'sulfation', 'sulfate_groups', 'the_GAG_chain', 'HSV_binding', 'two_native_GAGs', 'chondroitin_sulfate', 'heparan', 'sulfate', 'our_results', 'hyaluronan']"
"Our understanding of how antibodies are generated and function could help develop effective vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics against viruses such as HIV-1, SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV), and Hendra and Nipah viruses (henipaviruses). Although broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the HIV-1 were observed in patients, elicitation of such bnAbs remains a major challenge when compared to other viral targets. We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response. To further explore our hypothesis, we used the 454 sequence analysis of a large naïve library of human IgM antibodies which had been used for selecting antibodies against SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble G proteins (sG) of henipaviruses. We found that the human IgM repertoires from the 454 sequencing have diverse germline usages, recombination patterns, junction diversity, and a lower extent of somatic mutation. In this study, we identified antibody maturation intermediates that are related to bnAbs against the HIV-1 and other viruses as observed in normal individuals, and compared their genetic diversity and somatic mutation level along with available structural and functional data. Further computational analysis will provide framework for understanding the underlying genetic and molecular determinants related to maturation pathways of antiviral bnAbs that could be useful for applying novel approaches to the design of effective vaccine immunogens and antibody-based therapeutics.",We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a strategy to evade the immune system due to absent or very weak binding of germline antibodies to the conserved epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an effective immune response.,"['We', 'previously', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'HIV-1', 'could', 'have', 'evolved', 'a_strategy', 'to', 'evade', 'the_immune_system', 'due', 'to', 'absent_or_very_weak_binding', 'of', 'germline_antibodies', 'to', 'the_conserved_epitopes', 'that', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'sufficient', 'to', 'initiate', 'and/or', 'maintain', 'an_effective_immune_response', '.']",We previously hypothesized that HIV-1 could have evolved a_strategy to evade the_immune_system due to absent_or_very_weak_binding of germline_antibodies to the_conserved_epitopes that may not be sufficient to initiate and/or maintain an_effective_immune_response .,"['HIV-1', 'a_strategy', 'the_immune_system', 'absent_or_very_weak_binding', 'germline_antibodies', 'the_conserved_epitopes']"
"A disease with a sudden drop in egg production and shell-less eggs called, shell-less egg syndrome (SES) has been observed in Western Canada egg layer flocks since 2010. The etiology of this disease is not known. We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the shell gland causing various eggshell abnormalities. In this study, we screened egg layer flocks, in the provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK), with and without a history of SES for the presence of IBV infection. During 2015–2016, a total of 27 egg layer flocks were screened in AB (n = 7) and SK (n = 20). Eighty-one percent of the screened flocks (n = 22) were positive for IBV infection. Thirty of these isolates were successfully characterized using molecular tools targeting the most variable spike (S) 1 gene. IBV isolates from this study clustered into three genotypes based on partial S1 gene variability. The majority of the IBV isolates (70%) were Massachusetts (Mass) type, and the rest were either Connecticut (Conn) type or an uncharacterized genotype with genetic characteristics of Mass and Conn types. Since the majority of the IBV isolates included within the Mass type, we used a Mass type IBV isolate to reproduce SES in specific pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chickens in lay. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether other IBV isolates can cause SES, to clarify the pathogenesis of SES and to develop a vaccine in order to prevent SES as observed in Western Canadian layer flocks.",We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the shell gland causing various eggshell abnormalities.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'SES', 'is', 'caused', 'by', 'an', 'infectious', 'bronchitis', 'virus', '(', 'IBV', ')', 'strain', 'since', 'it', 'is', 'known', 'that', 'IBV', 'replicates', 'in', 'the_shell_gland', 'causing', 'various_eggshell_abnormalities', '.']",We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the_shell_gland causing various_eggshell_abnormalities .,"['SES', 'bronchitis', 'virus', 'IBV', 'IBV', 'the_shell_gland', 'various_eggshell_abnormalities']"
"In the present narrative review, we analyzed the relationship between seronegative celiac disease (SNCD) and immunoglobulin deficiencies. For this purpose, we conducted a literature search on the main medical databases. SNCD poses a diagnostic dilemma. Villous blunting, intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) count and gluten “challenge” are the most reliable markers. Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-targeted mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) immune complexes in the intestinal mucosa of SNCD patients may be useful. In our experience, tTG-mRNA was similarly increased in seropositive celiac disease (CD) and suspected SNCD, and strongly correlated with the IELs count. This increase is found even in the IELs’ range of 15–25/100 enterocytes, suggesting that there may be a “grey zone” of gluten-related disorders. An immune deregulation (severely lacking B-cell differentiation) underlies the association of SNCD with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Therefore, CD may be linked to autoimmune disorders and immune deficits (common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)/IgA selective deficiency). CVID is a heterogeneous group of antibodies dysfunction, whose association with CD is demonstrated only by the response to a gluten-free diet (GFD). We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID. Selective IgA deficiency, commonly associated with CD, accounts for IgA-tTG seronegativity. Selective IgM deficiency (sIgMD) is rare (<300 cases) and associated to CD in 5% of cases. We diagnosed SNCD in a patient affected by sIgMD using the tTG-mRNA assay. One-year GFD induced IgM restoration. This evidence, supporting a link between SNCD and immunoglobulin deficiencies, suggests that we should take a closer look at this association.",We hypothesized a familial inheritance between CD and CVID.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'a_familial_inheritance', 'between', 'CD', 'and', 'CVID', '.']",We hypothesized a_familial_inheritance between CD and CVID .,"['a_familial_inheritance', 'CD', 'CVID']"
"Five Japanese Black embryo transfer calves from a single embryo flush, 30 to 45-days-old, including 4 live animals for clinical examination and 1 dead for necropsy, were presented with a history of decreased milk intake and hypoproteinemia. Consistent clinicopathological abnormalities in the 4 calves presented for clinical evaluation included hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, increased creatine phosphokinase activity, and proteinuria. Four calves ultimately were necropsied and all had histologic evidence of immune complex glomerulonephritis.

"Background: Healthcare personnel often use incorrect technique for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Objective: We tested the hypothesis that medical students receive insufficient training on correct methods for donning and doffing PPE. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students on clinical rotations at two teaching hospitals to determine the type of training they received in PPE technique. The students performed simulations of contaminated PPE removal with fluorescent lotion on gloves and were assessed for correct PPE technique and skin and/or clothing contamination. To obtain additional information on PPE training during medical education, residents, fellows, and attending physicians completed written questionnaires on PPE training received during medical school and on knowledge of PPE protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results: Of 27 medical students surveyed, only 11 (41%) reported receiving PPE training, and none had received training requiring demonstration of proficiency. During simulations, 25 of 27 (92.5%) students had one or more lapses in technique and 12 (44%) contaminated their skin with fluorescent lotion. For 100 residents, fellows and attending physicians representing 67 different medical schools, only 53% reported receiving training in use of PPE and only 39% selected correct donning and doffing sequence. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a need for development of effective strategies to train medical students in correct use of PPE.

"During the co-evolution of viruses and their hosts, the viruses have evolved numerous strategies to counter and evade host antiviral immune responses in order to establish a successful infection, replicate and persist in the host. Recently, based on our model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoOLigomerization (SCHOOL) model, we suggested specific molecular mechanisms used by different viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to modulate the host immune response mediated by members of the family of multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs). This family includes T cell receptor (TCR) that is critically involved in immune diseases such as autoimmune arthritis. In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis. Using the SCHOOL approach and the SARS-CoV fusion peptide sequence, we rationally designed a novel immunomodulatory peptide that targets TCR. We showed that this peptide ameliorates collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1J mice and protects against bone and cartilage damage. Incorporation of the peptide into self-assembling lipopeptide nanoparticles that mimic native human high density lipoproteins significantly increases peptide dosage efficacy. Together, our data further confirm that viral immune evasion strategies that target MIRRs can be transferred to therapeutic strategies that require similar functionalities.","In the present study, we provide compelling experimental in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis.","['In', 'the_present_study', ',', 'we', 'provide', 'compelling', 'experimental', 'in', 'vivo_evidence', 'in', 'support', 'of', 'our_hypothesis', '.']","In the_present_study , we provide compelling experimental in vivo_evidence in support of our_hypothesis .","['the_present_study', 'compelling experimental', 'vivo_evidence', 'support', 'our_hypothesis']"
"PrP(Sc) is believed to serve as a template for the conversion of PrP(C) to the abnormal isoform. This process requires contact between the two proteins and implies that there may be critical contact sites that are important for conversion. We hypothesized that antibodies binding to either PrP(c)or PrP(Sc) would hinder or prevent the formation of the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) complex and thus slow down or prevent the conversion process. Two systems were used to analyze the effect of different antibodies on PrP(Sc) formation: (i) neuroblastoma cells persistently infected with the 22L mouse-adapted scrapie stain, and (ii) protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), which uses PrP(Sc) as a template or seed, and a series of incubations and sonications, to convert PrP(C) to PrP(Sc). The two systems yielded similar results, in most cases, and demonstrate that PrP-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) vary in their ability to inhibit the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) conversion process. Based on the numerous and varied Mabs analyzed, the inhibitory effect does not appear to be epitope specific, related to PrP(C) conformation, or to cell membrane localization, but is influenced by the targeted PrP region (amino vs carboxy).",We hypothesized that antibodies binding to either PrP(c)or PrP(Sc) would hinder or prevent the formation of the PrP(C)–PrP(Sc) complex and thus slow down or prevent the conversion process.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'antibodies', 'binding', 'to', 'either_PrP(c)or', 'PrP(Sc', ')', 'would', 'hinder', 'or', 'prevent', 'the_formation', 'of', 'the_PrP(C)–PrP(Sc)_complex', 'and', 'thus', 'slow', 'down', 'or', 'prevent', 'the_conversion_process', '.']",We hypothesized that antibodies binding to either_PrP(c)or PrP(Sc ) would hinder or prevent the_formation of the_PrP(C)–PrP(Sc)_complex and thus slow down or prevent the_conversion_process .,"['antibodies', 'either_PrP(c)or', 'PrP(Sc', 'the_formation', 'the_PrP(C)–PrP(Sc)_complex', 'the_conversion_process']"
"Searching for a mechanism underlying autoimmunity in autism, we postulated that gliadin peptides, heat shock protein 60 (HSP-60), and streptokinase (SK) bind to different peptidases resulting in autoantibody production against these components. We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens. Dysfunctional membrane peptidases and autoantibody production may result in neuroimmune dysregulation and autoimmunity.",We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases.,"['We', 'assessed', 'this_hypothesis', 'in', 'patients', 'with', 'autism', 'and', 'in', 'those', 'with', 'mixed_connective_tissue_diseases', '.']",We assessed this_hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed_connective_tissue_diseases .,"['this_hypothesis', 'patients', 'autism', 'mixed_connective_tissue_diseases']"
"A number of viruses remodel the cellular gene expression landscape by globally accelerating messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. Unlike the mammalian basal mRNA decay enzymes, which largely target mRNA from the 5′ and 3′ end, viruses instead use endonucleases that cleave their targets internally. This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s). Yet, how mRNA endonuclease specificity is achieved in mammalian cells remains largely unresolved. Here, we reveal key features underlying the biochemical mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by the SOX endonuclease encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Using purified KSHV SOX protein, we reconstituted the cleavage reaction in vitro and reveal that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of mRNA susceptibility observed in cells. Importantly, we establish that cleavage site specificity does not require additional cellular cofactors, as had been previously proposed. Thus, viral endonucleases may use a combination of RNA sequence and structure to capture a broad set of mRNA targets while still preserving selectivity.","This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective power, potentially though the use of a targeting motif(s).","['This', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'more', 'rapidly', 'inactivate', 'mRNA', 'while', 'maintaining', 'selective_power', ',', 'potentially', 'though', 'the_use', 'of', 'a_targeting_motif(s', ')', '.']","This is hypothesized to more rapidly inactivate mRNA while maintaining selective_power , potentially though the_use of a_targeting_motif(s ) .","['mRNA', 'selective_power', 'a_targeting_motif(s']"
"Infectious diseases are linked to 15%–20% of cancers worldwide. Among them, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus that chronically infects over 90% of the adult population, with over 200,000 cases of cancer and 150,000 cancer-related deaths attributed to it yearly. Acute EBV infection can present as infectious mononucleosis, and lead to the future onset of multiple cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Many of these cancers express latent viral genes, including Epstein–Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2). Previous attempts to create potent immunogens against EBV have been reported but generated mixed success. We designed novel Synthetic Consensus (SynCon) DNA vaccines against EBNA1, LMP1 and LMP2 to improve on the immune potency targeting important antigens expressed in latently infected cells. These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers. We optimized the genetic sequences for these three antigens, studied them for expression, and examined their immune profiles in vivo. We observed that these immunogens generated unique profiles based on which antigen was delivered as the vaccine target. EBNA1vax and LMP2Avax generated the most robust T cell immunity. Interestingly, LMP1vax was a very weak immunogen, generating very low levels of CD8 T cell immunity both as a standalone vaccine and as part of a trivalent vaccine cocktail. LMP2Avax was able to drive immunity that impacted EBV-antigen-positive tumor growth. These studies suggest that engineered EBV latent protein vaccines deserve additional study as potential agents for immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.",These EBV tumor antigens are hypothesized to be useful targets for potential immunotherapy of EBV-driven cancers.,"['These_EBV_tumor_antigens', 'are', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'be', 'useful_targets', 'for', 'potential_immunotherapy', 'of', 'EBV-driven_cancers', '.']",These_EBV_tumor_antigens are hypothesized to be useful_targets for potential_immunotherapy of EBV-driven_cancers .,"['These_EBV_tumor_antigens', 'useful_targets', 'EBV-driven_cancers']"
"BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which viruses cause asthma exacerbations are not precisely known. Previously, we showed that, in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized and -challenged mice with allergic airway inflammation, rhinovirus (RV) infection increases type 2 cytokine production from alternatively-activated (M2) airway macrophages, enhancing eosinophilic inflammation and airways hyperresponsiveness. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4 signaling determines the state of macrophage activation and pattern of RV-induced exacerbation in mice with allergic airways disease. METHODS: Eight week-old wild type or IL-4 receptor knockout (IL-4R KO) mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and inoculated with RV1B or sham HeLa cell lysate. RESULTS: In contrast to OVA-treated wild-type mice with both neutrophilic and eosinophilic airway inflammation, OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed increased neutrophilic inflammation with few eosinophils in the airways. Like wild-type mice, IL-4R KO mice showed OVA-induced airway hyperreactivity which was further exacerbated by RV. There was a shift in lung cytokines from a type 2-predominant response to a type 1 response, including production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α. IL-17A was also increased. RV infection of OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice further increased neutrophilic inflammation. Bronchoalveolar macrophages showed an M1 polarization pattern and ex vivo RV infection increased macrophage production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12p40. Finally, lung cells from OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice showed reduced CD206+ CD301+ M2 macrophages, decreased IL-13 and increased TNF-α and IL-17A production by F4/80+, CD11b+ macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: OVA-treated IL-4R KO mice show neutrophilic airway inflammation constituting a model of allergic, type 1 cytokine-driven neutrophilic asthma. In the absence of IL-4/IL-13 signaling, RV infection of OVA-treated mice increased type 1 cytokine and IL-17A production from conventionally-activated macrophages, augmenting neutrophilic rather than eosinophilic inflammation. In mice with allergic airways inflammation, IL-4R signaling determines macrophage activation state and the response to subsequent RV infection.","In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that IL-4","['In', 'this_paper', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'IL-4']","In this_paper , we tested the_hypothesis that IL-4","['this_paper', 'the_hypothesis', 'IL-4']"
"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus (arbovirus) in the family Flaviviridae, and the symptoms caused by ZIKV infection in humans include rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia and conjunctivitis. Codon usage bias analysis can reveal much about the molecular evolution and host adaption of ZIKV. To gain insight into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the codon usage pattern in 46 ZIKV strains by calculating the effective number of codons (ENc), codon adaptation index (CAI), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The results from a correspondence analysis (CA) indicate that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between ZIKV and its hosts suggest that ZIKV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from Homo sapiens on the ZIKV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Taken together, both natural translational selection and mutation pressure are important for shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of ZIKV and its adaption to its hosts.",Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV.,"['Several_lines', 'of', 'evidence', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'translational_selection', 'plays', 'a_role', 'in', 'shaping', 'the_codon_usage_pattern', 'of', 'ZIKV', '.']",Several_lines of evidence support the_hypothesis that translational_selection plays a_role in shaping the_codon_usage_pattern of ZIKV .,"['Several_lines', 'evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'translational_selection', 'a_role', 'the_codon_usage_pattern', 'ZIKV']"
"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) requires a programmed −1 ribosomal frameshift for Pol gene expression. The HIV frameshift site consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) followed by a spacer region and a downstream RNA stem–loop structure. Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the −1 frameshift. The stem–loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3–4 bp in the stem–loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","['Finally', ',', 'the_role', 'of', 'the_surrounding_genomic_secondary_structure', 'was', 'investigated', 'and', 'found', 'to', 'have', 'a_modest_impact', 'on', 'frameshift_efficiency', ',', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_genomic_secondary_structure', 'attenuates', 'frameshifting', 'by', 'affecting', 'the_overall_rate', 'of', 'translation', '.']","Finally , the_role of the_surrounding_genomic_secondary_structure was investigated and found to have a_modest_impact on frameshift_efficiency , consistent with the_hypothesis that the_genomic_secondary_structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the_overall_rate of translation .","['the_role', 'the_surrounding_genomic_secondary_structure', 'a_modest_impact', 'frameshift_efficiency', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_genomic_secondary_structure', 'frameshifting', 'the_overall_rate', 'translation']"
"High-throughput multi-omics studies and corresponding network analyses of multi-omic data have rapidly expanded their impact over the last 10 years. As biological features of different types (e.g. transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact within cellular systems, the greatest amount of knowledge can be gained from networks that incorporate multiple types of -omic data. However, biological and technical sources of variation diminish the ability to detect cross-type associations, yielding networks dominated by communities comprised of nodes of the same type. We describe here network building methods that can maximize edges between nodes of different data types leading to integrated networks, networks that have a large number of edges that link nodes of different–omic types (transcripts, proteins, lipids etc). We systematically rank several network inference methods and demonstrate that, in many cases, using a random forest method, GENIE3, produces the most integrated networks. This increase in integration does not come at the cost of accuracy as GENIE3 produces networks of approximately the same quality as the other network inference methods tested here. Using GENIE3, we also infer networks representing antibody-mediated Dengue virus cell invasion and receptor-mediated Dengue virus invasion. A number of functional pathways showed centrality differences between the two networks including genes responding to both GM-CSF and IL-4, which had a higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated vs. receptor-mediated Dengue network. Because a biological system involves the interplay of many different types of molecules, incorporating multiple data types into networks will improve their use as models of biological systems. The methods explored here are some of the first to specifically highlight and address the challenges associated with how such multi-omic networks can be assembled and how the greatest number of interactions can be inferred from different data types. The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","The resulting networks can lead to the discovery of new host response patterns and interactions during viral infection, generate new hypotheses of pathogenic mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease.","['The_resulting_networks', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'the_discovery', 'of', 'new_host_response_patterns', 'and', 'interactions', 'during', 'viral_infection', ',', 'generate', 'new_hypotheses', 'of', 'pathogenic_mechanisms', 'and', 'confirm', 'mechanisms', 'of', 'disease', '.']","The_resulting_networks can lead to the_discovery of new_host_response_patterns and interactions during viral_infection , generate new_hypotheses of pathogenic_mechanisms and confirm mechanisms of disease .","['The_resulting_networks', 'new_host_response_patterns', 'interactions', 'viral_infection', 'generate', 'new_hypotheses', 'pathogenic_mechanisms', 'mechanisms', 'disease']"
"Genome sequence analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) variants from patient specimens has revealed the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the virus. However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non–consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deep-sequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non–consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.","Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.","['Concurrently', ',', 'the_frequency', 'of', 'occurrence', 'of', 'the_wild_type', 'at', 'the_two_positions', 'was', 'only_6.5%', '±', '1.7%', 'on', 'average', ',', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'selection_pressure', 'exerted', 'by', 'the_host_immune_response', 'played', 'a_critical_role', 'in', 'shaping', 'genetic_variants', 'and', 'their_interaction', 'in', 'human_MERS-CoVs', 'during', 'the_outbreak', '.']","Concurrently , the_frequency of occurrence of the_wild_type at the_two_positions was only_6.5% ± 1.7% on average , supporting the_hypothesis that selection_pressure exerted by the_host_immune_response played a_critical_role in shaping genetic_variants and their_interaction in human_MERS-CoVs during the_outbreak .","['occurrence', 'the_wild_type', 'the_two_positions', 'only_6.5%', '±', '1.7%', 'the_hypothesis', 'selection_pressure', 'the_host_immune_response', 'played a_critical_role', 'shaping genetic_variants', 'human_MERS-CoVs', 'the_outbreak']"
"In the UK, attempts since the 1970s to control the incidence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle by culling a wildlife host, the European badger (Meles meles), have produced equivocal results. Culling-induced social perturbation of badger populations may lead to unexpected outcomes. We test predictions from the ‘perturbation hypothesis’, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Culling operations did not remove all individuals from setts, with between 34–43% of badgers removed from targeted social groups. After culling, bTB prevalence increased in badger social groups neighbouring removals, particularly amongst cubs. Seventy individual adult badgers were fitted with radio-collars, yielding 8,311 locational fixes from both sites between November 2001 and December 2003. Home range areas of animals surviving within removed groups increased by 43.5% in response to culling. Overlap between summer ranges of individuals from Neighbouring social groups in the treatment population increased by 73.3% in response to culling. The movement rate of individuals between social groups was low, but increased after culling, in Removed and Neighbouring social groups. Increased bTB prevalence in Neighbouring groups was associated with badger movements both into and out of these groups, although none of the moving individuals themselves tested positive for bTB. Significant increases in both the frequency of individual badger movements between groups and the emergence of bTB were observed in response to culling. However, no direct evidence was found to link the two phenomena. We hypothesise that the social disruption caused by culling may not only increase direct contact and thus disease transmission between surviving badgers, but may also increase social stress within the surviving population, causing immunosuppression and enhancing the expression of disease.","We test predictions from the ‘perturbation hypothesis’, determining the impact of culling operations on badger populations, movement of surviving individuals and the influence on the epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two study areas within the UK Government's Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT).","['We', 'test', 'predictions', 'from', 'the_‘perturbation_hypothesis', '’', ',', 'determining', 'the_impact', 'of', 'culling', 'operations', 'on', 'badger_populations', ',', 'movement', 'of', 'surviving_individuals', 'and', 'the_influence', 'on', 'the_epidemiology', 'of', 'bTB', 'in', 'badgers', 'using', 'data', 'dervied', 'from', 'two_study_areas', 'within', ""the_UK_Government's_Randomised_Badger_Culling_Trial"", '(', 'RBCT', ')', '.']","We test predictions from the_‘perturbation_hypothesis ’ , determining the_impact of culling operations on badger_populations , movement of surviving_individuals and the_influence on the_epidemiology of bTB in badgers using data dervied from two_study_areas within the_UK_Government's_Randomised_Badger_Culling_Trial ( RBCT ) .","['predictions', 'the_‘perturbation_hypothesis', 'the_impact', 'operations', 'badger_populations', 'movement', 'surviving_individuals', 'the_influence', 'the_epidemiology', 'bTB', 'badgers', 'data', 'two_study_areas', '( RBCT']"
"Experiments measuring Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between cytokine receptor chains and their associated proteins led to hypotheses describing their organization in intact cells. These interactions occur within a larger protein complex or within a given nano-environment. To illustrate this complexity empirically, we developed a protocol to analyze FRET among more than two fluorescent proteins (multi-FRET). In multi-FRET, we model FRET among more than two fluorophores as the sum of all possible pairwise interactions within the complex. We validated our assumption by demonstrating that FRET among pairs within a fluorescent triplet resembled FRET between each pair measured in the absence of the third fluorophore. FRET between two receptor chains increases with increasing FRET between the ligand-binding chain (e.g., IFN-γR1, IL-10R1 and IFN-λR1) and an acylated fluorescent protein that preferentially resides within subsections of the plasma membrane. The interaction of IL-10R2 with IFN-λR1 or IL-10R1 results in decreased FRET between IL-10R2 and the acylated fluorescent protein. Finally, we analyzed FRET among four fluorescent proteins to demonstrate that as FRET between IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 or between IFN-αR1 and IFN-αR2c increases, FRET among other pairs of proteins changes within each complex.",Experiments measuring Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between cytokine receptor chains and their associated proteins led to hypotheses describing their organization in intact cells.,"['Experiments', 'measuring', 'Fluorescence_Resonance_Energy_Transfer', '(', 'FRET', ')', 'between', 'cytokine_receptor_chains', 'and', 'their_associated_proteins', 'led', 'to', 'hypotheses', 'describing', 'their_organization', 'in', 'intact_cells', '.']",Experiments measuring Fluorescence_Resonance_Energy_Transfer ( FRET ) between cytokine_receptor_chains and their_associated_proteins led to hypotheses describing their_organization in intact_cells .,"['Experiments', 'Fluorescence_Resonance_Energy_Transfer', '( FRET', 'cytokine_receptor_chains', 'their_associated_proteins', 'hypotheses', 'their_organization', 'intact_cells']"
"INTRODUCTION: A dysregulated immune response leading to sepsis is the most frequent cause of late post-traumatic deaths. We have found a novel anti-inflammatory pathway that is initiated by the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), interacting with Fcγ receptor (FcγR) on monocytes. This pathway is protective in animal models of endotoxin shock. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the FcγR might contribute to monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma. METHODS: We conducted an observational study on a prospectively identified cohort of adult patients with convenience enrollment admitted after severe trauma. We enrolled 66 patients and collected blood samples at enrollment and again at 48 and 72 hrs. Patients were followed through their hospital stay and any septic events before 14 days were recorded. Cytokine and CRP levels were determined in the plasma from all three blood draws. Additionally, DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for the 131 H/R FcγRIIa polymorphism that strongly affects the binding of IgG and CRP to this receptor. RESULTS: Elevated levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 MCP-1 as well as CRP were associated with reduced time to post-traumatic sepsis in Cox regression analysis. Expression of monocyte HLA-DR below 45% on patient monocytes was also associated with sepsis (HR = 3.15, 95% CI 1.45-6.93). Genetic analysis found that individuals with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP poorly were also more likely to have decreased monocyte HLA-DR and post-traumatic sepsis. In vitro studies showed that CRP could attenuate monocyte deactivation in volunteers with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a common genetic variation in the FcγRIIa receptor may contribute to infectious susceptibility in trauma patients. In vitro experiments suggest that this association is related to the inability of CRP to bind to this FcγRIIa receptor variant.

"Avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) can cause lifelong infection and can escape from the host immune defenses in chickens. Since macrophages act as the important defense line against invading pathogens in host innate immunity, we investigated the function and innate immune responses of chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after ALV-J infection in this study. Our results indicated that ALV-J was stably maintained in MDM cells but that the viral growth rate was significantly lower than that in DF-1 cells. We also found that ALV-J infection significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production, but had no effect on MDM phagocytic capacity. Interestingly, infection with ALV-J rapidly promoted the expression levels of Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx) (3 h, 6 h), ISG12 (6 h), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (3 h, 12 h) at an early infection stage, whereas it sharply decreased the expression of Mx (24 h, 36 h), ISG12 (36 h), and made little change on IL-1β (24 h, 36 h) production at a late infection stage in MDM cells. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon-β (IFN-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) had sharply increased in infected MDM cells from 3 to 36 h post infection (hpi) of ALV-J. And, the protein level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) was dramatically decreased at 36 hpi in MDM cells infected with ALV-J. These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.",These results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an important role in host innate immune attack and ALV-J immune escape.,"['These_results', 'demonstrate', 'that', 'ALV-J', 'can', 'induce', 'host', 'innate', 'immune_responses', 'and', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'macrophages', 'play', 'an_important_role', 'in', 'host', 'innate', 'immune_attack', 'and', 'ALV-J_immune_escape', '.']",These_results demonstrate that ALV-J can induce host innate immune_responses and we hypothesize that macrophages play an_important_role in host innate immune_attack and ALV-J_immune_escape .,"['These_results', 'host', 'immune_responses', 'macrophages', 'an_important_role', 'host', 'immune_attack', 'ALV-J_immune_escape']"
"Rapid and accurate detection and identification of viruses causing respiratory tract infections is important for patient care and disease control. Despite the fact that several assays are available, identification of an etiological agent is not possible in ∼30% of patients suffering from respiratory tract diseases. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a diagnostic set for the detection of respiratory viruses with sensitivity as low as 1–10 copies per reaction. Evaluation of the assay using a training clinical sample set showed that viral nucleic acids were identified in ∼76% of cases. To improve assay performance and facilitate the identification of novel species or emerging strains, cultures of fully differentiated human airway epithelium were used to pre-amplify infectious viruses. This additional step resulted in the detection of pathogens in all samples tested. Based on these results it can be hypothesized that the lack of an etiological agent in some clinical samples, both reported previously and observed in the present study, may result not only from the presence of unknown viral species, but also from imperfections in the detection methods used.","Based on these results it can be hypothesized that the lack of an etiological agent in some clinical samples, both reported previously and observed in the present study, may result not only from the presence of unknown viral species, but also from imperfections in the detection methods used.","['Based', 'on', 'these_results', 'it', 'can', 'be', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_lack', 'of', 'an_etiological_agent', 'in', 'some_clinical_samples', ',', 'both', 'reported', 'previously', 'and', 'observed', 'in', 'the_present_study', ',', 'may', 'result', 'not', 'only', 'from', 'the_presence', 'of', 'unknown_viral_species', ',', 'but', 'also', 'from', 'imperfections', 'in', 'the_detection_methods', 'used', '.']","Based on these_results it can be hypothesized that the_lack of an_etiological_agent in some_clinical_samples , both reported previously and observed in the_present_study , may result not only from the_presence of unknown_viral_species , but also from imperfections in the_detection_methods used .","['these_results', 'the_lack', 'an_etiological_agent', 'some_clinical_samples', 'the_present_study', 'the_presence', 'unknown_viral_species', 'imperfections', 'the_detection_methods']"
"Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a complex illness involving the activation of multiple pathways leading to lung injury, resolution and repair. Since the first description of ALI, a great deal of effort has been devoted to exploring the roles of individual pathways in humans and animal models. These have led to a much greater understanding of the complexity of ALI and the links between ALI and systemic multiorgan failure. Despite progress in many areas, we still do not have an integrated understanding of the initiating factors, the key steps in the progression of ALI, and the central processes involved in repair. Although animal models have suggested a range of new hypotheses for study, the major need is for a better understanding of how pathways interact to explain the complexity of the human ALI syndrome and how complementary treatments can be used simultaneously or sequentially to modify the onset, severity and outcome of ALI in humans.","Although animal models have suggested a range of new hypotheses for study, the major need is for a better understanding of how pathways interact to explain the complexity of the human ALI syndrome and how complementary treatments can be used simultaneously or sequentially to modify the onset, severity and outcome of ALI in humans.","['Although', 'animal_models', 'have', 'suggested', 'a_range', 'of', 'new_hypotheses', 'for', 'study', ',', 'the_major_need', 'is', 'for', 'a_better_understanding', 'of', 'how', 'pathways', 'interact', 'to', 'explain', 'the_complexity', 'of', 'the_human_ALI_syndrome', 'and', 'how', 'complementary_treatments', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'simultaneously', 'or', 'sequentially', 'to', 'modify', 'the_onset', ',', 'severity', 'and', 'outcome', 'of', 'ALI', 'in', 'humans', '.']","Although animal_models have suggested a_range of new_hypotheses for study , the_major_need is for a_better_understanding of how pathways interact to explain the_complexity of the_human_ALI_syndrome and how complementary_treatments can be used simultaneously or sequentially to modify the_onset , severity and outcome of ALI in humans .","['animal_models', 'a_range', 'new_hypotheses', 'study', 'the_major_need', 'pathways', 'complementary_treatments', 'the_onset', 'severity', 'outcome', 'ALI', 'humans']"
"Sepsis is a poorly understood syndrome of systemic inflammation responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year. The integrity of the gut epithelium and competence of adaptive immune responses are notoriously compromised during sepsis, and the prevalent assumption in the scientific and medical community is that intestinal commensals have a detrimental role in the systemic inflammation and susceptibility to nosocomial infections seen in critically ill, septic patients. However, breakthroughs in the last decade provide strong credence to the idea that our mucosal microbiome plays an essential role in adaptive immunity, where a human host and its prokaryotic colonists seem to exist in a carefully negotiated armistice with compromises and benefits that go both ways. In this review, we re-examine the notion that intestinal contents are the driving force of critical illness. An overview of the interaction between the microbiome and the immune system is provided, with a special focus on the impact of commensals in priming and the careful balance between normal intestinal flora and pathogenic organisms residing in the gut microbiome. Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the gut, along with compromises in epithelial integrity. As a result, normal antigen sampling becomes impaired, and proliferative cues are intermixed with inhibitory signals. This situates the microbiome, the gut, and its complex immune network of cells and bacteria, at the center of aberrant immune responses during and after sepsis.","Based on the data in hand, we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial populations residing in the gut, along with compromises in epithelial integrity.","['Based', 'on', 'the_data', 'in', 'hand', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'sepsis', 'induces', 'imbalances', 'in', 'microbial_populations', 'residing', 'in', 'the_gut', ',', 'along', 'with', 'compromises', 'in', 'epithelial_integrity', '.']","Based on the_data in hand , we hypothesize that sepsis induces imbalances in microbial_populations residing in the_gut , along with compromises in epithelial_integrity .","['the_data', 'hand', 'sepsis', 'imbalances', 'microbial_populations', 'the_gut', 'compromises', 'epithelial_integrity']"
"BACKGROUND: Improving accuracy and efficiency of computational methods that predict pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures is an ongoing challenge. Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information. RESULTS: We present a new method, Iterative HFold, for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction. Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of IPknot, and with about 35% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of HotKnots V2.0 while being significantly faster.

"We hypothesized that invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) may generate a distinctive proteomic signature in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Proteins in plasma and BAL from two neutropenic rabbit models of IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS. Hierarchical clustering analysis of plasma time course spectra demonstrated two clusters of peaks that were differentially regulated between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia (57 and 34 peaks, respectively, p<0.001). PCA of plasma proteins demonstrated a time-dependent separation of the two infections. A random forest analysis that ranked the top 30 spectral points distinguished between late Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Based on spectral data analysis, three proteins were identified using SDS-PAGE and LC/MS and quantified using reverse phase arrays. Differences in the temporal sequence of plasma haptoglobin (p <0.001), apolipoprotein A1 (p<0.001) and transthyretin (p<0.038) were observed between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as was C-reactive protein (p<0.001). In summary, proteomic analysis of plasma and BAL proteins of experimental Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias demonstrates unique protein profiles with principal components and spectral regions that are shared in early infection and diverge at later stages of infection.

"BACKGROUND: Understanding population responses to influenza helps optimize public health interventions. Relevant theoretical frameworks remain nascent. PURPOSE: To model associations between trust in information, perceived hygiene effectiveness, knowledge about the causes of influenza, perceived susceptibility and worry, and personal hygiene practices (PHPs) associated with influenza. METHODS: Cross-sectional household telephone surveys on avian influenza A/H5N1 (2006) and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (2009) gathered comparable data on trust in formal and informal sources of influenza information, influenza-related knowledge, perceived hygiene effectiveness, worry, perceived susceptibility, and PHPs. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed domain content while confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the extracted factors. The hypothesized model, compiled from different theoretical frameworks, was optimized with structural equation modelling using the A/H5N1 data. The optimized model was then tested against the A/H1N1 dataset. RESULTS: The model was robust across datasets though corresponding path weights differed. Trust in formal information was positively associated with perceived hygiene effectiveness which was positively associated with PHPs in both datasets. Trust in formal information was positively associated with influenza worry in A/H5N1 data, and with knowledge of influenza cause in A/H1N1 data, both variables being positively associated with PHPs. Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry in both datasets. Independent of information trust, perceived influenza susceptibility associated with influenza worry. Worry associated with PHPs in A/H5N1 data only. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of influenza cause and perceived PHP effectiveness were associated with PHPs.

"BACKGROUND: Developments in DNA resequencing microarrays include mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and mutation detection. Failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an 'N-call.' This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA. FINDINGS: We analysed 16 patient mtDNA samples using MitoChip. N-calls by the proprietary GSEQ software were significantly reduced when either of the freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi or sPROFILER was utilized. With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.","This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA.","['This_study', 're', '-', 'examined', 'the_N-call_distribution', 'of', 'mtDNA_samples', 'sequenced', 'by', 'the', 'Affymetrix', 'MitoChip', 'v.2.0', ',', 'based', 'on', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'N-calls', 'may', 'represent', 'insertions', 'or', 'deletions', '(', 'indels', ')', 'in', 'mtDNA', '.']","This_study re - examined the_N-call_distribution of mtDNA_samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0 , based on the_hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions ( indels ) in mtDNA .","['re', 'mtDNA_samples', 'Affymetrix', 'MitoChip', 'the_hypothesis', 'N-calls', 'insertions', 'deletions', 'indels', 'mtDNA']"
"BACKGROUND: Community acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections occur frequently after lung transplantation and may adversely impact outcomes. We hypothesized that while asymptomatic carriage would not increase the risk of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and graft loss, severe infection would. METHODS: All lung transplant cases between January 2000 and July 2013 performed at our center were reviewed for respiratory viral samples. Each isolation of virus was classified according to clinical level of severity: asymptomatic, symptomatic without pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Multivariate Cox modeling was employed to assess the impact of CARV isolation on progression to CLAD and graft loss. RESULTS: 4408 specimens were collected from 563 total patients with 139 patients producing 324 virus positive specimens in 245 episodes of CARV infection. Overall, the risk of CLAD was elevated by viral infection (HR 1.64, p < 0.01). This risk, however, was due to viral pneumonia alone (HR 3.94, p < 0.01), without significant impact from symptomatic viral infection (HR 0.97, p = 0.94) nor from asymptomatic viral infection (HR 0.99, p = 0.98). The risk of graft loss was not increased by asymptomatic CARV infection (HR 0.74, p = 0.37) nor symptomatic CARV infection (HR 1.39, p = 0.41). Viral pneumonia did, however, significantly increase the risk of graft loss (HR 2.78, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: With respect to CARV, only viral pneumonia increased the risk of both CLAD and graft loss after lung transplantation.

"OBJECTIVE: Cineole has mucolytic, bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory properties and reduces the exacerbation rate in patients suffering from COPD, as well as ameliorates symptoms in patients suffering from asthma and rhinosinusitis. Based on these effects, we therefore postulated the hypothesis that patients with acute bronchitis would also benefit from therapy with Cineole. METHODS: As part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center-study, a total of 242 patients with confirmed acute bronchitis was randomly selected to participate. Over a period of 10 days, all patients were administered 3 x 200 mg of Cineole, or a respective placebo, per day. The primary outcome measure was a Bronchitis Sum Score, which summarises the relevant symptoms of acute bronchitis. RESULTS: After 4 days of treatment it was notable, that the patient group treated with Cineole, showed significantly more improvements of the bronchitis-sum-score than those of the placebo group (p = 0.0383). The statistical significant difference of the individual outcome measures was especially underlined by the frequency of cough fits by p = 0.0001 after 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study corroborates the fact that Cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four days. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact.

"The genomes of plus-strand RNA viruses contain many regulatory sequences and structures that direct different viral processes. The traditional view of these RNA elements are as local structures present in non-coding regions. However, this view is changing due to the discovery of regulatory elements in coding regions and functional long-range intra-genomic base pairing interactions. The ∼4.8 kb long RNA genome of the tombusvirus tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) contains these types of structural features, including six different functional long-distance interactions. We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and, accordingly, we sought to assess the global conformation of the entire TBSV genome. Atomic force micrographs of the genome indicated a mostly condensed structure composed of interconnected protrusions extending from a central hub. This configuration was consistent with the genomic secondary structure model generated using high-throughput selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (i.e. SHAPE), which predicted different sized RNA domains originating from a central region. Known RNA elements were identified in both domain and inter-domain regions, and novel structural features were predicted and functionally confirmed. Interestingly, only two of the six long-range interactions known to form were present in the structural model. However, for those interactions that did not form, complementary partner sequences were positioned relatively close to each other in the structure, suggesting that the secondary structure level of viral genome structure could provide a basic scaffold for the formation of different long-range interactions. The higher-order structural model for the TBSV RNA genome provides a snapshot of the complex framework that allows multiple functional components to operate in concert within a confined context.","We hypothesized that to achieve these multiple interactions this viral genome must utilize a large-scale organizational strategy and,","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'to', 'achieve', 'these_multiple_interactions', 'this_viral_genome', 'must', 'utilize', 'a_large-scale_organizational_strategy', 'and', ',']","We hypothesized that to achieve these_multiple_interactions this_viral_genome must utilize a_large-scale_organizational_strategy and ,","['these_multiple_interactions', 'a_large-scale_organizational_strategy']"
"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a pediatric vasculitis syndrome that is often involves coronary artery lesions (e. g., coronary artery aneurysms). Although its causal factors and entire pathogenesis remain elusive, the available evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of KD is closely associated with dysregulation of immune responses to various viruses or microbes. In this short review, we address several essential aspects of the etiology of KD with respect to the immune response to infectious stimuli: 1) the role of viral infections, 2) the role of bacterial infections and the superantigen hypothesis, 3) involvement of innate immune response including pathogens/microbe-associated molecular patterns and complement pathways, and 4) the influence of genetic background on the response to infectious stimuli. Based on the clinical and experimental evidence, we discuss the possibility that a wide range of microbes and viruses could cause KD through common and distinct immune processes.","the role of bacterial infections and the superantigen hypothesis, 3) involvement of innate immune response including pathogens/microbe-associated molecular patterns and complement pathways, and 4)","['the_role', 'of', 'bacterial_infections', 'and', 'the_superantigen_hypothesis', ',', '3', ')', 'involvement', 'of', 'innate_immune_response', 'including', 'pathogens/microbe-associated_molecular_patterns', 'and', 'complement_pathways', ',', 'and', '4', ')']","the_role of bacterial_infections and the_superantigen_hypothesis , 3 ) involvement of innate_immune_response including pathogens/microbe-associated_molecular_patterns and complement_pathways , and 4 )","['the_role', 'bacterial_infections', 'the_superantigen_hypothesis', 'involvement', 'innate_immune_response', 'pathogens/microbe-associated_molecular_patterns', 'complement_pathways']"
"BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is primarily driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components [lipoteichoic acid (LTA)]. An acute release of these components occurs when pneumococcal infection is treated with β-lactam antibiotics. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. METHODS: In the PRISTINE (Pneumonia treated with RIfampicin aTtenuates INflammation) trial, a randomized, therapeutic controlled, exploratory study in patients with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, we looked at LTA release and inflammatory and clinical response during treatment with both rifampicin and β-lactam compared with treatment with β-lactam antibiotics only. The trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR3751 (European Clinical Trials Database number 2012-003067-22). RESULTS: Forty-one patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included; 17 of them had pneumococcal pneumonia. LTA release, LTA-mediated inflammatory responses, clinical outcomes, inflammatory biomarkers and transcription profiles were not different between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The PRISTINE study demonstrated the feasibility of adding rifampicin to β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia, but, despite solid in vitro and experimental animal research evidence, failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma LTA concentrations and subsequent inflammatory and clinical responses. Most likely, an inhibitory effect of human plasma contributes to the low immune response in these patients. In addition, LTA plasma concentration could be too low to mount a response via Toll-like receptor 2 in vitro, but may nonetheless have an effect in vivo.",We hypothesized that non-lytic rifampicin compared with lytic β-lactam antibiotic treatment would attenuate the inflammatory response in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that_non-lytic_rifampicin', 'compared', 'with', 'lytic_β-lactam_antibiotic_treatment', 'would', 'attenuate', 'the_inflammatory_response', 'in', 'patients', 'with', 'pneumococcal_pneumonia', '.']",We hypothesized that_non-lytic_rifampicin compared with lytic_β-lactam_antibiotic_treatment would attenuate the_inflammatory_response in patients with pneumococcal_pneumonia .,"['lytic_β-lactam_antibiotic_treatment', 'the_inflammatory_response', 'patients', 'pneumococcal_pneumonia']"
"The development of an effective vaccine is critical for prevention of a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pandemic. Some studies have indicated the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of MERS-CoV spike (S) is a good candidate antigen for a MERS-CoV subunit vaccine. However, highly purified proteins are typically not inherently immunogenic. We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen. Therefore, the immunogenicity of a novel MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine was tested in mice using different adjuvant formulations and delivery routes. Different vaccination regimens were compared in BALB/c mice immunized 3 times intramuscularly (i.m.) with a vaccine containing 10 µg of recombinant MERS-CoV RBD in combination with either aluminium hydroxide (alum) alone, alum and polyriboinosinic acid (poly I:C) or alum and cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). The immune responses of mice vaccinated with RBD, incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and CpG ODN by a subcutaneous (s.c.) route were also investigated. We evaluated the induction of RBD-specific humoral immunity (total IgG and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity (ELISpot assay for IFN-γ spot-forming cells and splenocyte cytokine production). Our findings indicated that the combination of alum and CpG ODN optimized the development of RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity following subunit vaccination. Interestingly, robust RBD-specific antibody and T-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the rRBD protein in combination with IFA and CpG ODN, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were elicited. Our data suggest that murine immunity following subunit vaccination can be tailored using adjuvant combinations and delivery routes. The vaccination regimen used in this study is promising and could improve the protection offered by the MERS-CoV subunit vaccine by eliciting effective humoral and cellular immune responses.",We hypothesised that humoral and cell-mediated immunity would be improved with a modification of the vaccination regimen.,"['We', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'humoral_and_cell-mediated_immunity', 'would', 'be', 'improved', 'with', 'a_modification', 'of', 'the_vaccination_regimen', '.']",We hypothesised that humoral_and_cell-mediated_immunity would be improved with a_modification of the_vaccination_regimen .,"['humoral_and_cell-mediated_immunity', 'a_modification', 'the_vaccination_regimen']"
"Circulative transmission of viruses in the Luteoviridae, such as cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV), requires a series of precisely orchestrated interactions between virus, plant, and aphid proteins. Natural selection has favored these viruses to be retained in the phloem to facilitate acquisition and transmission by aphids. We show that treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate with sodium sulfite reduces transmission of the purified virus by aphids. Transmission electron microscopy data indicated no gross change in virion morphology due to treatments. However, treated virions were not acquired by aphids through the hindgut epithelial cells and were not transmitted when injected directly into the hemocoel. Analysis of virus preparations using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed a number of host plant proteins co-purifying with viruses, some of which were lost following sodium sulfite treatment. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we show data suggesting that several of the virus-associated host plant proteins accumulated to higher levels in aphids that were fed on CYDV-infected plants compared to healthy plants. We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a) that sodium sulfite treatment disrupts critical virion-host protein interactions required for aphid transmission, or (b) that host infection with CYDV modulates phloem protein expression in a way that is favorable for virus uptake by aphids. Importantly, the genes coding for the plant proteins associated with virus may be examined as targets in breeding cereal crops for new modes of virus resistance that disrupt phloem-virus or aphid-virus interactions.","We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a)","['We', 'propose', 'two_hypotheses', 'to', 'explain', 'these_observations', ',', 'and', 'these', 'are', 'not', 'mutually', 'exclusive', ':', '(', 'a', ')']","We propose two_hypotheses to explain these_observations , and these are not mutually exclusive : ( a )","['two_hypotheses', 'these_observations']"
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the most relevant causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%).

"Healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections (HARVIs) result in significant harm to infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. METHODS: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. RESULTS: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days.

"Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human transmission. It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.","To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market.","['To', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'zoonotic_origin', 'of', '2019-nCoV', 'stemming', 'from', 'the_Huanan_seafood_market', ',', 'the_index_case', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'exposure_history', 'related', 'to', 'the_market', 'and', 'the_virus', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'identified', 'from', 'animals', 'sold', 'at', 'the_market', '.']","To support the_hypothesis of zoonotic_origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the_Huanan_seafood_market , the_index_case should have had exposure_history related to the_market and the_virus should have been identified from animals sold at the_market .","['the_hypothesis', 'zoonotic_origin', '2019-nCoV', 'the_Huanan_seafood_market', 'the_index_case', 'the_market', 'the_virus', 'animals']"
"Collagen-induced arthritis is a B cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Recently published studies have demonstrated that in some rare cases pathogens can confer protection from autoimmunity. Trypanosoma brucei parasites are tsetse fly transmitted extracellular protozoans causing sleeping sickness disease in humans and Nagana in livestock in sub-Saharan endemic areas. In the past, we demonstrated that trypanosome infections impair B cell homeostasis and abolish vaccine-induced protection against unrelated antigens. Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice. We observed a substantial delay in the onset of collagen-induced arthritis in T. brucei-infected DBA/1 mice that correlates with a drastic decrease of type II collagen titers of the different IgG isotypes in the serum. Treatment of infected mice with Berenil, a trypanocidal drug, restored the development of CIA-associated clinical symptoms. Interestingly, these data were confirmed by the challenge of immunized DBA/1 prone mice with T. brucei-infected tsetse flies. Together, these results demonstrate that T. brucei infection is impairing the maintenance of the antigen specific plasma B cell pool driving the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.","Hence, here we hypothesized that trypanosome infection can affect the onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific B-cell responses and type II collagen antibody titers in DBA/1 prone mice.","['Hence', ',', 'here', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'trypanosome_infection', 'can', 'affect', 'the_onset', 'of', 'CIA', 'by', 'specifically', 'dampening', 'specific_B-cell_responses', 'and', 'type', 'II_collagen_antibody_titers', 'in', 'DBA/1_prone_mice', '.']","Hence , here we hypothesized that trypanosome_infection can affect the_onset of CIA by specifically dampening specific_B-cell_responses and type II_collagen_antibody_titers in DBA/1_prone_mice .","['trypanosome_infection', 'the_onset', 'CIA', 'specifically dampening specific_B-cell_responses', 'II_collagen_antibody_titers', 'DBA/1_prone_mice']"
"The occurrence of clathrin-coated buds on immature granules (IGs) of the regulated secretory pathway suggests that specific transmembrane proteins are sorted into these buds through interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins. By quantitative immunoelectron microscopy of rat endocrine pancreatic β cells and exocrine parotid and pancreatic cells, we show for the first time that the mannose 6–phosphate receptors (MPRs) for lysosomal enzyme sorting colocalize with the AP-1 adaptor in clathrin-coated buds on IGs. Furthermore, the concentrations of both MPR and AP-1 decline by ∼90% as the granules mature. Concomitantly, in exocrine secretory cells lysosomal proenzymes enter and then are sorted out of IGs, just as was previously observed in β cells (Kuliawat, R., J. Klumperman, T. Ludwig, and P. Arvan. 1997. J. Cell Biol. 137:595–608). The exit of MPRs in AP-1/clathrin-coated buds is selective, indicated by the fact that the membrane protein phogrin is not removed from maturing granules. We have also made the first observation of a soluble N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, syntaxin 6, which has been implicated in clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking from the TGN to endosomes (Bock, J.B., J. Klumperman, S. Davanger, and R.H. Scheller. 1997. Mol. Biol. Cell. 8:1261–1271) that enters and then exits the regulated secretory pathway during granule maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR–ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.","Thus, we hypothesize that during secretory granule maturation, MPR–ligand complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated vesicles, and then delivered to endosomes.","['Thus', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'during', 'secretory_granule_maturation', ',', 'MPR', '–', 'ligand_complexes', 'and', 'syntaxin', '6', 'are', 'removed', 'from', 'IGs', 'by', 'AP-1/clathrin-coated_vesicles', ',', 'and', 'then', 'delivered', 'to', 'endosomes', '.']","Thus , we hypothesize that during secretory_granule_maturation , MPR – ligand_complexes and syntaxin 6 are removed from IGs by AP-1/clathrin-coated_vesicles , and then delivered to endosomes .","['secretory_granule_maturation', 'MPR', 'ligand_complexes', 'syntaxin', 'IGs', 'AP-1/clathrin-coated_vesicles', 'endosomes']"
"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is pleiotropic mediator of a diverse array of physiological and neurological functions, including both normal regulatory functions and immune responses to infectious agents. Its role in the nervous system is prominent but paradoxical. Studies on uninflamed or “normal” brain have generally attributed TNF-α a neuromodulatory effect. In contrast, in inflamed or diseased brain, the abundance of evidence suggests that TNF-α has an overall neurotoxic effect, which may be particularly pronounced for virally mediated neurological disease. Still others have found TNF-α to be protective under some conditions of neurological insult. It is still uncertain exactly how TNF-α is able to induce these opposing effects through receptor activation of only a limited set of cell signaling pathways. In this paper, we provide support from the literature to advance our hypothesis that one mechanism by which TNF-α can exert its paradoxical effects in the brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth factors or other cytokines.","In this paper, we provide support from the literature to advance our hypothesis that one mechanism by which TNF-α can exert its paradoxical effects in the brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth factors or other cytokines.","['In', 'this_paper', ',', 'we', 'provide', 'support', 'from', 'the_literature', 'to', 'advance', 'our_hypothesis', 'that', 'one_mechanism', 'by', 'which', 'TNF-α', 'can', 'exert', 'its_paradoxical_effects', 'in', 'the_brain', 'is', 'via', 'crosstalk', 'with', 'signaling', 'pathways', 'of', 'growth_factors', 'or', 'other_cytokines', '.']","In this_paper , we provide support from the_literature to advance our_hypothesis that one_mechanism by which TNF-α can exert its_paradoxical_effects in the_brain is via crosstalk with signaling pathways of growth_factors or other_cytokines .","['this_paper', 'support', 'the_literature', 'our_hypothesis', 'one_mechanism', 'which TNF-α', 'its_paradoxical_effects', 'the_brain', 'crosstalk', 'signaling', 'pathways', 'growth_factors', 'other_cytokines']"
"Mesenchymal stem cells have been widely studied to promote local bone regeneration of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Previous studies observed that dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) enhanced the angiogenic and osteogenic activity of mesenchymal stem cells by activating the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby improving the bone repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. In the present study, it was investigated whether DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the treatment of ONFH. Western blot analysis was performed to detect HIF-1α protein expression in ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The results showed DMOG enhanced HIF-1α expression in ASCs in a dose-dependent manner at least for 7 days. Furthermore, DMOG-treated ASCs were transplanted into the necrotic area of a rabbit model of ONFH to treat the disease. Four weeks later, micro-computed tomography (CT) quantitative analysis showed that 58.8±7.4% of the necrotic area was regenerated in the DMOG-treated ASCs transplantation group, 45.5±3.4% in normal ASCs transplantation group, 25.2±2.8% in only core decompression group and 10.6±2.6% in the untreated group. Histological analysis showed that transplantation of DMOG-treated ASCs clearly improved the bone regeneration of the necrotic area compared with the other three groups. Micro-CT and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the revasculation of the necrotic area were also increased significantly in the DMOG-treated ASC group compared with the control groups. Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α expression in the treatment of ONFH.","Thus, it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the bone repair capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α expression in the treatment of ONFH.","['Thus', ',', 'it', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'DMOG', 'could', 'increase', 'the_bone_repair_capacity', 'of', 'ASCs', 'through', 'enhancing', 'HIF-1α_expression', 'in', 'the_treatment', 'of', 'ONFH', '.']","Thus , it is hypothesized that DMOG could increase the_bone_repair_capacity of ASCs through enhancing HIF-1α_expression in the_treatment of ONFH .","['DMOG', 'the_bone_repair_capacity', 'ASCs', 'HIF-1α_expression', 'the_treatment', 'ONFH']"
"Abstract Diabetes mellitus is a growing problem in all parts of the world. Both clinical trials and animal models of type I and type II diabetes have shown that hyperactivity of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) signaling pathways contribute to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications. Of clinical relevance, blockade of the renin–angiotensin system prevents new-onset diabetes and reduces the risk of diabetic complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently discovered mono-carboxypeptidase and the first homolog of ACE. It is thought to inhibit Ang-II signaling cascades mostly by cleaving Ang-II to generate Ang-(1–7), which effects oppose Ang-II and are mediated by the Mas receptor. The enzyme is present in the kidney, liver, adipose tissue and pancreas. Its expression is elevated in the endocrine pancreas in diabetes and in the early phase during diabetic nephropathy. ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Recently, we have shown the presence of the Mas receptor in the mouse pancreas and observed a reduction in Mas receptor immuno-reactivity as well as higher fasting blood glucose levels in ACE2 knockout mice, indicating that these mice may be a new model to study the role of ACE2 in diabetes. In this review we will examine the role of the renin–angiotensin system in the physiopathology and treatment of diabetes and highlight the potential benefits of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis, focusing on recent data about ACE2.",ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a compensatory manner in both diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.,"['ACE2', 'is', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'act', 'in', 'a_compensatory_manner', 'in', 'both_diabetes', 'and', 'diabetic_nephropathy', '.']",ACE2 is hypothesized to act in a_compensatory_manner in both_diabetes and diabetic_nephropathy .,"['ACE2', 'a_compensatory_manner', 'both_diabetes', 'diabetic_nephropathy']"
"BACKGROUND: Falls are an issue of great public health concern. This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations. RESULTS: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. CONCLUSION: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified.

"Ebola virus, a member of the family Filoviridae has caused immense morbidity and mortality in recent times, especially in West Africa.

"Rationale: An activated vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and fibrotic axis of the renin angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]/angiotensin [Ang]II/AngII type 1 receptor) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The recent discovery of a counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system composed of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas has led us to examine the role of this vasoprotective axis on such disorders. Objectives: We hypothesized that Ang-(1–7) treatment would exert protective effects against PF and PH. Methods: Lentiviral packaged Ang-(1–7) fusion gene or ACE2 cDNA was intratracheally administered into the lungs of male Sprague Dawley rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received bleomycin (2.5 mg/kg). In a subsequent study, animals were administered monocrotaline (MCT, 50 mg/kg). Measurements and Main Results: In the PF study, bleomycin administration resulted in a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which was associated with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. The lungs of these animals also exhibited excessive collagen deposition, decreased expression of ACE and ACE2, increased mRNA levels for transforming growth factor β and other proinflammatory cytokines, and increased protein levels of the AT(1)R. Overexpression of Ang-(1–7) significantly prevented all the above-mentioned pathophysiological conditions. Similar protective effects were also obtained with ACE2 overexpression. In the PH study, rats injected with MCT developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, all of which were attenuated by Ang-(1–7) overexpression. Blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1–7) against MCT-induced PH. Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate a cardiopulmonary protective role for the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis in the treatment of lung disorders.",We hypothesized that Ang-(1–7),"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'Ang-(1–7', ')']",We hypothesized that Ang-(1–7 ),[]
"A common technique used for sensitive and specific diagnostic virus detection in clinical samples is PCR that can identify one or several viruses in one assay. However, a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen. We have established such a diagnostic platform for random amplification and subsequent microarray identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples. We show that Phi29 polymerase-amplification of a diverse set of clinical samples generates enough viral material for successful identification by the Microbial Detection Array, demonstrating the potential of the microarray technique for broad-spectrum pathogen detection. We conclude that this method detects both DNA and RNA virus, present in the same sample, as well as differentiates between different virus subtypes. We propose this assay for diagnostic analysis of viruses in clinical samples.","However, a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all human pathogens could replace hundreds of individual PCR-reactions and remove the need for a clear clinical hypothesis regarding a suspected pathogen.","['However', ',', 'a', 'diagnostic', 'microarray', 'containing', 'probes', 'for', 'all_human_pathogens', 'could', 'replace', 'hundreds', 'of', 'individual_PCR-reactions', 'and', 'remove', 'the_need', 'for', 'a_clear_clinical_hypothesis', 'regarding', 'a_suspected_pathogen', '.']","However , a diagnostic microarray containing probes for all_human_pathogens could replace hundreds of individual_PCR-reactions and remove the_need for a_clear_clinical_hypothesis regarding a_suspected_pathogen .","['probes', 'all_human_pathogens', 'hundreds', 'individual_PCR-reactions', 'the_need', 'a_clear_clinical_hypothesis', 'a_suspected_pathogen']"
"BACKGROUND: Infections with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BoCV) are endemic to the cattle populations in most countries, causing respiratory and/or enteric disease. It has been demonstrated that herds can remain free from these infections for several years also in high prevalence areas. Organically managed (OM) dairy herds have been shown to have lower seroprevalence of both viruses compared to conventionally managed (CM) herds. The objective of this study was to challenge the hypothesis of a lower occurrence of BRSV and BoCV in OM compared to CM dairy herds. In November 2011, May 2012 and May 2013 milk samples from four homebred primiparous cows were collected in 75 to 65 OM and 69 to 62 CM herds. The antibody status regarding BRSV and BoCV was analysed with commercial indirect ELISAs. Herds were classified as positive if at least one individual sample was positive. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive herds ranged from 73.4% to 82.3% for BRSV and from 76.8% to 85.3% for BoCV among OM and CM herds, over the three sampling occasions. There was no statistically significant difference between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion. The incidence risk of newly infected herds did not differ statistically between OM and CM herds at any sampling occasion, neither for BRSV nor for BoCV. The incidence of herds turning sero-negative between samplings corresponded to the incidence of newly infected. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were also sampled in the herds and analysed. Several herds were negative on individual samples but positive in BTM. Herd-level data on production, health and reproduction were retrieved from VÄXA Sweden and the study herds were representative of the source population. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in prevalence of or incidence risk for BRSV or BoCV between Swedish OM and CM herds. Because the incidence of herds becoming seropositive was balanced by herds becoming seronegative it should be possible to lower the prevalence of these two infections among Swedish dairy cattle herds if biosecurity is improved.

"Many emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand flies. Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the non-structural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector.","['These', 'are', 'hypothesised', 'to', 'target', 'incoming_viral_transcripts', 'to', 'modulate', 'viral_titre', ',', 'perhaps', 'rendering', 'the_organism', 'a_more_efficient_arbovirus_vector', '.']","These are hypothesised to target incoming_viral_transcripts to modulate viral_titre , perhaps rendering the_organism a_more_efficient_arbovirus_vector .","['incoming_viral_transcripts', 'viral_titre', 'the_organism a_more_efficient_arbovirus_vector']"
"Proteins are essential macromolecules of life that carry out most cellular processes. Since proteins aggregate to perform function, and since protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks model these aggregations, one would expect to uncover new biology from PPI network topology. Hence, using PPI networks to predict protein function and role of protein pathways in disease has received attention. A debate remains open about whether network properties of “biologically central (BC)” genes (i.e., their protein products), such as those involved in aging, cancer, infectious diseases, or signaling and drug-targeted pathways, exhibit some topological centrality compared to the rest of the proteins in the human PPI network. To help resolve this debate, we design new network-based approaches and apply them to get new insight into biological function and disease. We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network. We propose two different concepts of topological centrality. We design a new centrality measure to capture complex wirings of proteins in the network that identifies as TC those proteins that reside in dense extended network neighborhoods. Also, we use the notion of domination and find dominating sets (DSs) in the PPI network, i.e., sets of proteins such that every protein is either in the DS or is a neighbor of the DS. Clearly, a DS has a TC role, as it enables efficient communication between different network parts. We find statistically significant enrichment in BC genes of TC nodes and outperform the existing methods indicating that genes involved in key biological processes occupy topologically complex and dense regions of the network and correspond to its “spine” that connects all other network parts and can thus pass cellular signals efficiently throughout the network. To our knowledge, this is the first study that explores domination in the context of PPI networks.",We hypothesize that BC genes have a topologically central (TC) role in the human PPI network.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'BC_genes', 'have', 'a_topologically_central_(TC)_role', 'in', 'the_human_PPI_network', '.']",We hypothesize that BC_genes have a_topologically_central_(TC)_role in the_human_PPI_network .,"['BC_genes', 'the_human_PPI_network']"
"OBJECTIVE: Fibrotic changes are initiated early in acute respiratory distress syndrome. This may involve overproliferation of alveolar type II cells. In an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, we have shown that the administration of an adenoviral vector overexpressing the 70-kd heat shock protein (AdHSP) limited pathophysiological changes. We hypothesized that this improvement may be modulated, in part, by an early AdHSP-induced attenuation of alveolar type II cell proliferation. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. SETTING: Hadassah-Hebrew University and University of Pennsylvania animal laboratories. SUBJECTS: Sprague-Dawley Rats (250 g). INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats via cecal ligation and double puncture. At the time of cecal ligation and double puncture, we injected phosphate-buffered saline, AdHSP, or AdGFP (an adenoviral vector expressing the marker green fluorescent protein) into the trachea. Rats then received subcutaneous bromodeoxyuridine. In separate experiments, A549 cells were incubated with medium, AdHSP, or AdGFP. Some cells were also stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α. After 48 hrs, cytosolic and nuclear proteins from rat lungs or cell cultures were isolated. These were subjected to immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, fluorescent immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Alveolar type I cells were lost within 48 hrs of inducing acute respiratory distress syndrome. This was accompanied by alveolar type II cell proliferation. Treatment with AdHSP preserved alveolar type I cells and limited alveolar type II cell proliferation. Heat shock protein 70 prevented overexuberant cell division, in part, by inhibiting hyperphosphorylation of the regulatory retinoblastoma protein. This prevented retinoblastoma protein ubiquitination and degradation and, thus, stabilized the interaction of retinoblastoma protein with E2F1, a key cell division transcription factor. CONCLUSIONS: Heat shock protein 70-induced attenuation of cell proliferation may be a useful strategy for limiting lung injury when treating acute respiratory distress syndrome if consistent in later time points.","We hypothesized that this improvement may be modulated, in part, by an early AdHSP-induced attenuation of alveolar type II cell proliferation.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'this_improvement', 'may', 'be', 'modulated', ',', 'in', 'part', ',', 'by', 'an_early_AdHSP-induced_attenuation', 'of', 'alveolar_type_II_cell_proliferation', '.']","We hypothesized that this_improvement may be modulated , in part , by an_early_AdHSP-induced_attenuation of alveolar_type_II_cell_proliferation .","['this_improvement', 'part', 'an_early_AdHSP-induced_attenuation', 'alveolar_type_II_cell_proliferation']"
"A 24-year-old African-American man presented with malaise and low back pain and was found to have acute severe rhabdomyolysis followed by acute hemolysis.

Our patient reported playing football, along with upper respiratory infection symptoms, prior to presentation. Extensive infectious and toxicology workup was negative; however, several inflammatory proteins were markedly elevated. We hypothesized the large inflammatory burden led to an increased reactive oxygen radical burden that overwhelmed muscle and erythrocyte reducing power.

"BACKGROUND: The lectin griffithsin (GRFT) is a potent antiviral agent capable of prevention and treatment of infections caused by a number of enveloped viruses and is currently under development as an anti-HIV microbicide. In addition to its broad antiviral activity, GRFT is stable at high temperature and at a broad pH range, displays little toxicity and immunogenicity, and is amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Native GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer that binds to viral envelope glycoproteins and has displayed mid-picomolar activity in cell-based anti-HIV assays. Previously, we have engineered and analyzed several monomeric forms of this lectin (mGRFT) with anti-HIV EC(50) values ranging up to 323 nM. Based on our previous analysis of mGRFT, we hypothesized that the orientation and spacing of the carbohydrate binding domains GRFT were key to its antiviral activity. RESULTS: Here we present data on engineered tandem repeats of mGRFT (mGRFT tandemers) with antiviral activity at concentrations as low as one picomolar in whole-cell anti-HIV assays. mGRFT tandemers were analyzed thermodynamically, both individually and in complex with HIV-1 gp120. We also demonstrate by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy that mGRFT tandemers do not aggregate HIV virions. This establishes that, although the intra-virion crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins is likely integral to their activity, the antiviral activity of these lectins is not due to virus aggregation caused by inter-virion crosslinking. CONCLUSIONS: The engineered tandemer constructs of mGRFT may provide novel and powerful agents for prevention of infection by HIV and other enveloped viruses.

"Abstract The sequential determination of crystal structures of the SARS coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with its cellular receptor or neutralizing antibody opened a door for the design and development of antiviral competitive inhibitors. Based on those complex structures, we conduct computational characterization and design of RBD-mediated receptor recognition and antibody neutralization. The comparisons between computational predictions and experimental evidences validate our structural bioinformatics protocols. And the calculations predict a number of single substitutions on RBD, receptor or antibody that could remarkably elevate the binding affinities of those complexes.

"The 1977-1978 influenza epidemic was probably not a natural event, as the genetic sequence of the virus was nearly identical to the sequences of decades-old strains. While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF) influenza virus research, as an argument for why this research should not be performed. There is now a moratorium in the United States on funding GOF research while the benefits and risks, including the potential for accident, are analyzed. Given the importance of this historical epidemic to ongoing policy debates, we revisit the evidence that the 1977 epidemic was not natural and examine three potential origins: a laboratory accident, a live-vaccine trial escape, or deliberate release as a biological weapon. Based on available evidence, the 1977 strain was indeed too closely matched to decades-old strains to likely be a natural occurrence. While the origin of the outbreak cannot be conclusively determined without additional evidence, there are very plausible alternatives to the laboratory accident hypothesis, diminishing the relevance of the 1977 experience to the modern GOF debate.","While there are several hypotheses that could explain its origin, the possibility that the 1977 epidemic resulted from a laboratory accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the biosafety risks of gain-of-function (GOF)","['While', 'there', 'are', 'several_hypotheses', 'that', 'could', 'explain', 'its_origin', ',', 'the_possibility', 'that', 'the_1977_epidemic', 'resulted', 'from', 'a_laboratory_accident', 'has', 'recently', 'gained', 'popularity', 'in', 'discussions', 'about', 'the_biosafety_risks', 'of', 'gain', '-', 'of', '-', 'function', '(', 'GOF', ')']","While there are several_hypotheses that could explain its_origin , the_possibility that the_1977_epidemic resulted from a_laboratory_accident has recently gained popularity in discussions about the_biosafety_risks of gain - of - function ( GOF )","['several_hypotheses', 'its_origin', 'the_possibility', 'the_1977_epidemic', 'a_laboratory_accident', 'popularity', 'discussions', 'the_biosafety_risks', 'gain', 'function', '( GOF']"
"Abstract Rain has been known to remove aerosol particles in air environments. The aerosol particles were captured and removed from the air by rain and the concentration of aerosol particles significantly decreased after rain events. Therefore, rain is regarded as having a good effect on air environments in terms of the respiratory health of the general public. However, humid environments produced by long-term rain events such a monsoon may be a sufficient condition for the growth of microorganisms and vibrations because of the splashing of droplets may facilitate the aerosolization of ground microorganisms. We therefore hypothesize that the rain may increase concentrations of bioaerosols in outdoor air environments, thereby possibly influencing respiratory diseases. To verify this hypothesis, at the initial stepwise approach, we measured the concentration of airborne biological particles before, after, and during rain in a monsoon season. The measurement data of the concentration of fungal particles and bacterial particles show quantitatively that the bioaerosol concentrations during the rain event are several times higher than the concentration of the bioaerosols in the condition of no rain.","We therefore hypothesize that the rain may increase concentrations of bioaerosols in outdoor air environments, thereby possibly influencing respiratory diseases.","['We', 'therefore', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_rain', 'may', 'increase', 'concentrations', 'of', 'bioaerosols', 'in', 'outdoor_air_environments', ',', 'thereby', 'possibly', 'influencing', 'respiratory_diseases', '.']","We therefore hypothesize that the_rain may increase concentrations of bioaerosols in outdoor_air_environments , thereby possibly influencing respiratory_diseases .","['the_rain', 'concentrations', 'bioaerosols', 'outdoor_air_environments', 'respiratory_diseases']"
"Several self-report measures of conspiracist beliefs have been developed in Western populations, but examination of their psychometric properties outside Europe and North America is limited. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of three widely-used measures of conspiracist beliefs in Iran. We translated the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI), Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), and Generic Conspiracist Belief Scale (GCBS) into Persian. Factorial validity was examined using principal-axis factor analysis in a community sample from Tehran, Iran (N = 544). Further, the relationships between scores on these measures and hypothesized antecedents (i.e., education, schizotypal personality, information processing style, superstitious beliefs, religiosity, and political orientation) were examined. Overall, we failed to find support for the parent factor structures of two of the three scales (BCTI and GCBS) and evidence of construct validity for all three scales was limited.

Murine survival and weight loss were assessed, and lung viral load was quantified via plaque assay. Here, we report that iNO administered prophylactically or post-influenza infection failed to improve survival of infected mice. No difference in lung viral load was observed between experimental groups.

"During virus entry, the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus (EBOV) undergoes a complex set of transformations within the endosomal network. Tools to study EBOV entry have been limited to static immunofluorescence or biochemical and functional analysis. In a recent article in mBio, Spence et al. reported a novel, live-cell-imaging method that tracks this transformational journey of EBOV in real time [J. S. Spence, T. B. Krause, E. Mittler, R. K. Jangra, and K. Chandran, mBio 7(1):e01857-15, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01857-15]. The assay validates known mechanisms of EBOV entry and sheds light on some novel intricacies. Direct evidence supports the hypothesis that fusion is a rare event that starts in maturing early endosomes, is completed in late endosomes, and occurs entirely in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive (NPC1(+)) compartments. The study demonstrated that lipid mixing and productive fusion are temporally decoupled, with different energetic barriers and a protease-dependent step between the two events. Analysis of the mechanism of action of an important class of EBOV neutralizing antibodies, such as KZ52 and ZMapp, provides direct evidence that these antibodies act by inhibiting the membrane fusion.","Direct evidence supports the hypothesis that fusion is a rare event that starts in maturing early endosomes, is completed in late endosomes, and occurs entirely in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive (NPC1(+)) compartments.","['Direct_evidence', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'fusion', 'is', 'a_rare_event', 'that', 'starts', 'in', 'maturing', 'early_endosomes', ',', 'is', 'completed', 'in', 'late_endosomes', ',', 'and', 'occurs', 'entirely', 'in', 'Niemann', '-', 'Pick', 'C1', '(', 'NPC1)-positive', '(', 'NPC1(+', ')', ')', 'compartments', '.']","Direct_evidence supports the_hypothesis that fusion is a_rare_event that starts in maturing early_endosomes , is completed in late_endosomes , and occurs entirely in Niemann - Pick C1 ( NPC1)-positive ( NPC1(+ ) ) compartments .","['Direct_evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'that fusion', 'a_rare_event', 'maturing early_endosomes', 'late_endosomes', 'Niemann', 'Pick', 'C1', 'NPC1(+', 'compartments']"
"BACKGROUND: The major role of enzymatic toxins that target nucleic acids in biological conflicts at all levels has become increasingly apparent thanks in large part to the advances of comparative genomics. Typically, toxins evolve rapidly hampering the identification of these proteins by sequence analysis. Here we analyze an unexpectedly widespread superfamily of toxin domains most of which possess RNase activity. RESULTS: The HEPN superfamily is comprised of all α-helical domains that were first identified as being associated with DNA polymerase β-type nucleotidyltransferases in prokaryotes and animal Sacsin proteins. Using sensitive sequence and structure comparison methods, we vastly extend the HEPN superfamily by identifying numerous novel families and by detecting diverged HEPN domains in several known protein families. The new HEPN families include the RNase LS and LsoA catalytic domains, KEN domains (e.g. RNaseL and Ire1) and the RNase domains of RloC and PrrC. The majority of HEPN domains contain conserved motifs that constitute a metal-independent endoRNase active site. Some HEPN domains lacking this motif probably function as non-catalytic RNA-binding domains, such as in the case of the mannitol repressor MtlR. Our analysis shows that HEPN domains function as toxins that are shared by numerous systems implicated in intra-genomic, inter-genomic and intra-organismal conflicts across the three domains of cellular life. In prokaryotes HEPN domains are essential components of numerous toxin-antitoxin (TA) and abortive infection (Abi) systems and in addition are tightly associated with many restriction-modification (R-M) and CRISPR-Cas systems, and occasionally with other defense systems such as Pgl and Ter. We present evidence of multiple modes of action of HEPN domains in these systems, which include direct attack on viral RNAs (e.g. LsoA and RNase LS) in conjunction with other RNase domains (e.g. a novel RNase H fold domain, NamA), suicidal or dormancy-inducing attack on self RNAs (RM systems and possibly CRISPR-Cas systems), and suicidal attack coupled with direct interaction with phage components (Abi systems). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis on coupling of pathogen-targeting (immunity) and self-directed (programmed cell death and dormancy induction) responses in the evolution of robust antiviral strategies. We propose that altruistic cell suicide mediated by HEPN domains and other functionally similar RNases was essential for the evolution of kin and group selection and cell cooperation. HEPN domains were repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes and incorporated into several core functions such as endonucleolytic processing of the 5.8S-25S/28S rRNA precursor (Las1), a novel ER membrane-associated RNA degradation system (C6orf70), sensing of unprocessed transcripts at the nuclear periphery (Swt1). Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, similar to prokaryotes, HEPN proteins were recruited to antiviral, antitransposon, apoptotic systems or RNA-level response to unfolded proteins (Sacsin and KEN domains) in several groups of eukaryotes. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive sequence and structure comparisons reveal unexpectedly broad presence of the HEPN domain in an enormous variety of defense and stress response systems across the tree of life.

"Bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly. We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, that is balance between commensals and potential pathogens, is involved in pathogen overgrowth and consequently disease. We compared oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients (n=100) with healthy elderly (n=91) by 16S-rRNA-based sequencing and verified our findings in young adult pneumonia patients (n=27) and young healthy adults (n=187). Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, P<0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls. Clustering resulted in 11 (sub)clusters including 95% (386/405) of samples. We observed three microbiota profiles strongly associated with pneumonia (P<0.05) and either dominated by lactobacilli (n=11), Rothia (n=51) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (n=42). In contrast, three other microbiota clusters (in total n=183) were correlated with health (P<0.05) and were all characterized by more diverse profiles containing higher abundances of especially Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella and Leptotrichia. For the remaining clusters (n=99), the association with health or disease was less clear. A decision tree model based on the relative abundance of five bacterial community members in URT microbiota showed high specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 84% (89% and 73%, respectively, after cross-validation) for differentiating pneumonia patients from healthy individuals. These results suggest that pneumonia in elderly and young adults is associated with dysbiosis of the URT microbiome with bacterial overgrowth of single species and absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria. Whether the observed microbiome changes are a cause or a consequence of the development of pneumonia or merely coincide with disease status remains a question for future research.","We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, that is balance between commensals and potential pathogens, is involved in pathogen overgrowth and consequently disease.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'dysbiosis', 'between', 'regular_residents', 'of', 'the_upper_respiratory_tract', '(URT)_microbiome', ',', 'that', 'is', 'balance', 'between', 'commensals', 'and', 'potential_pathogens', ',', 'is', 'involved', 'in', 'pathogen_overgrowth', 'and', 'consequently_disease', '.']","We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular_residents of the_upper_respiratory_tract (URT)_microbiome , that is balance between commensals and potential_pathogens , is involved in pathogen_overgrowth and consequently_disease .","['that dysbiosis', 'regular_residents', 'the_upper_respiratory_tract', 'balance', 'commensals', 'potential_pathogens', 'pathogen_overgrowth', 'consequently_disease']"
"BACKGROUND: DC-SIGNR (also called CD209L) has been extensively studied on its role in host genetic predisposition to viral infection. In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span. METHODS: Here we collected 361 peri-centenarian individuals (age ≥94 for female and age ≥90 for male) and 342 geographically matched controls (age 22-53, mean 35.0 ± 12.0) from Han Chinese. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was determined by PCR and genotype was called by separating the PCR products in agarose gel. RESULTS: A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that there was absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population. But the question of whether the DC-SIGNR could affect longevity in a gender-specific pattern remains open.","As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span.","['As', 'infection', 'is', 'a_major_cause', 'of', 'human_death', 'and', 'a_mechanism', 'of', 'natural_selection', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'VNTR_polymorphism', 'of', 'DC-SIGNR', 'might', 'have', 'an_effect', 'on', 'human_life_span', '.']","As infection is a_major_cause of human_death and a_mechanism of natural_selection , we hypothesized that VNTR_polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an_effect on human_life_span .","['infection', 'a_major_cause', 'human_death', 'a_mechanism', 'natural_selection', 'VNTR_polymorphism', 'DC-SIGNR', 'an_effect', 'human_life_span']"
"Despite substantial progress, mortality and morbidity of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI), remain unacceptably high. There is no effective treatment for ARDS/ALI. The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) through Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-generated Angiotensin II contributes to lung injury. ACE2, a recently discovered ACE homologue, acts as a negative regulator of the RAS and counterbalances the function of ACE. We hypothesized that ACE2 prevents Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury. Fourteen to 16-week-old ACE2 knockout mice—male (ACE2(−/y)) and female (ACE2(−/−))—and age-matched wild-type (WT) male mice received intratracheal BLM (1.5U/kg). Male ACE2(−/y) BLM injured mice exhibited poorer exercise capacity, worse lung function and exacerbated lung fibrosis and collagen deposition compared with WT. These changes were associated with increased expression of the profibrotic genes α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and Transforming Growth Factor ß1. Compared with ACE2(−/y) exposed to BLM, ACE2(−/−) exhibited better lung function and architecture and decreased collagen deposition. Treatment with intraperitoneal recombinant human (rh) ACE2 (2 mg/kg) for 21 days improved survival, exercise capacity, and lung function and decreased lung inflammation and fibrosis in male BLM-WT mice. Female BLM WT mice had mild fibrosis and displayed a possible compensatory upregulation of the AT2 receptor. We conclude that ACE2 gene deletion worsens BLM-induced lung injury and more so in males than females. Conversely, ACE2 protects against BLM-induced fibrosis. rhACE2 may have therapeutic potential to attenuate respiratory morbidity in ALI/ARDS.",We hypothesized that ACE2 prevents Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'ACE2', 'prevents', 'Bleomycin', '(', 'BLM)-induced_lung_injury', '.']",We hypothesized that ACE2 prevents Bleomycin ( BLM)-induced_lung_injury .,"['ACE2', 'Bleomycin', '( BLM)-induced_lung_injury']"
"Wildlife has been considered the main source of novel viruses causing emerging infectious diseases. Marmota himalayana is endemic to the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, China. Here, based on a high-throughput method using Illumina RNA sequencing, we studied the RNA virome of M. himalayana and discovered multiple novel viruses, especially picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which have a bi-segmented genome and belong to the family Picobirnaviridae. A total of 63% of the viral contigs corresponded to PBVs, comprising 274 segment 1 and 56 segment 2 sequences. Unexpectedly, four unsegmented PBV genomes were also detected and confirmed by PCR and resequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the following nine PBV assortment types are proposed: C1:GI, C2:GIV, C4:GI, C4:GV, C5:GI, C7:GI, C8:GIV, C8:GV and C8:GII. We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG. The model is supported by detection of the segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG not only in the 5′ untranslated regions of segment 1 (221 in 289) and segment 2 (57 in 80) of bi-segmented PBVs but also in the 5′ untranslated regions and junction sequences between the capsid and RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs. Therefore, with RNA sequencing, we found an unexpected biodiversity of PBVs in M. himalayana, indicating that M. himalayana is a special host for PBVs. We also proposed a putative model of how bi-segmented PBVs could be converted into unsegmented PBVs, which sheds new light on the processes of RNA virus genome evolution.","We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'a_model', 'of', 'segmentation', 'for', 'the', 'PBV', 'genome', ',', 'mediated', 'by', 'a_6-bp_direct_repeat_sequence', ',', 'GAAAGG', '.']","We hypothesize a_model of segmentation for the PBV genome , mediated by a_6-bp_direct_repeat_sequence , GAAAGG .","['a_model', 'segmentation', 'PBV', 'a_6-bp_direct_repeat_sequence', 'GAAAGG']"
"During spring-summer 2009, several observational studies from Canada showed increased risk of medically-attended, laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 illness among prior recipients of 2008–09 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Explanatory hypotheses included direct and indirect vaccine effects. In a randomized placebo-controlled ferret study, we tested whether prior receipt of 2008–09 TIV may have directly influenced A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. Thirty-two ferrets (16/group) received 0.5 mL intra-muscular injections of the Canadian-manufactured, commercially-available, non-adjuvanted, split 2008–09 Fluviral or PBS placebo on days 0 and 28. On day 49 all animals were challenged (Ch0) with A(H1N1)pdm09. Four ferrets per group were randomly selected for sacrifice at day 5 post-challenge (Ch+5) and the rest followed until Ch+14. Sera were tested for antibody to vaccine antigens and A(H1N1)pdm09 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), nucleoprotein-based ELISA and HA1-based microarray assays. Clinical characteristics and nasal virus titers were recorded pre-challenge then post-challenge until sacrifice when lung virus titers, cytokines and inflammatory scores were determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-naïve animals. Antibody rise to vaccine antigens was evident by ELISA and HA1-based microarray but not by HI or MN assays; virus challenge raised antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 by all assays in both groups. Beginning at Ch+2, vaccinated animals experienced greater loss of appetite and weight than placebo animals, reaching the greatest between-group difference in weight loss relative to baseline at Ch+5 (7.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.01). At Ch+5 vaccinated animals had higher lung virus titers (log-mean 4.96 vs. 4.23pfu/mL, respectively; p = 0.01), lung inflammatory scores (5.8 vs. 2.1, respectively; p = 0.051) and cytokine levels (p>0.05). At Ch+14, both groups had recovered. Findings in influenza-naïve, systematically-infected ferrets may not replicate the human experience. While they cannot be considered conclusive to explain human observations, these ferret findings are consistent with direct, adverse effect of prior 2008–09 TIV receipt on A(H1N1)pdm09 illness.

"BACKGROUND: Sporothrix schenckii and associated species are agents of human and animal sporotrichosis that cause large sapronoses and zoonoses worldwide. Epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks, leading to massive transmissions to humans. Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans. METHODOLOGY: We explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies (IgG) specific against Sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis. Antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 49), healthy cats (n = 19), and cats with other diseases (n = 20). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis (area under the curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94–1; P<0.0001) versus controls. The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents. One-dimensional immunoblotting indicated that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (a 60-kDa protein in S. brasiliensis and a 70-kDa protein in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant antigen in feline sporotrichosis. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed six IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60 in the S. brasiliensis proteome, similar to the humoral response found in human sporotrichosis. CONCLUSIONS: A convergent IgG-response in various hosts (mice, cats, and humans) has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of Sporothrix and its warm-blooded hosts. We propose that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase has potential for the serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis and as target for the development of an effective multi-species vaccine against sporotrichosis in animals and humans.","The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents.","['The_two_sets', 'of', 'Sporothrix_antigens', 'were', 'remarkably', 'cross', '-', 'reactive', ',', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'antigenic_epitopes', 'may', 'be', 'conserved', 'among', 'closely_related_agents', '.']","The_two_sets of Sporothrix_antigens were remarkably cross - reactive , supporting the_hypothesis that antigenic_epitopes may be conserved among closely_related_agents .","['The_two_sets', 'Sporothrix_antigens', 'the_hypothesis', 'antigenic_epitopes', 'closely_related_agents']"
"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most diverse genetic regions under pathogen-driven selection because of its central role in antigen binding and immunity. The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Seba’s short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.

"Genes involved in human immune response are well recognized to influence the clinical course of infection.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNG (rs2430561/rs1861493), STAT1 (rs1914408), and VDR (rs2228570) genes were determined in 85 patients from the 2007 Dutch acute Q fever outbreak, and a symptom score was calculated. IFNG rs1861493 showed a significant association with the symptom score; IFNG rs2430561 showed a similar trend. These SNPs were then used to reproduce results in a 2009 outbreak population (n = 123). The median symptom score differed significantly in both populations: 2 versus 7. The significant association of IFNG rs1861493 with symptom score in the first population was not reproduced in the second population.

"BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen alpha C chain 5.9 kDa fragment (FIC5.9) is a new serum biomarker for chronic hepatitis that was discovered by proteomics analysis. Previous studies have shown that FIC5.9 is derived from the C-terminal region of fibrinogen alpha chain and the serum levels of FIC5.9 decrease in chronic hepatitis. It also have been reported that FIC5.9 cannot be detected in the blood stream of the systemic circulation and it is released from fibrinogen during blood clotting in collecting tube. However, the mechanism of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen is unclear. METHODS: We formulated a hypothesis that FIC5.9 is released by enzymes that are activated by post-blood collection and may be coagulation and fibrinolysis factors. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms of FIC5.9 releasing from fibrinogen in healthy blood. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that thrombin acts as an initiator for FIC5.9 releasing, and that mainly plasmin cleaves N-terminal end of FIC5.9 and neutrophil elastase cleave C-terminal end of FIC5.9. CONCLUSION: FIC5.9 reflects minute changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis factors and may be associated with pathological conditions.

"The evolutionary origins of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are unknown. Current evidence suggests that insectivorous bats are likely to be the original source, as several 2c CoVs have been described from various species in the family Vespertilionidae. Here, we describe a MERS-like CoV identified from a Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is closely related to MERS-CoV across much of its genome, consistent with a common ancestry; however, the spike protein was highly divergent (46% amino acid identity), suggesting that the two viruses may have different receptor binding properties. Indeed, several amino acid substitutions were identified in key binding residues that were predicted to block PREDICT/PDF-2180 from attaching to the MERS-CoV DPP4 receptor. To experimentally test this hypothesis, an infectious MERS-CoV clone expressing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein was generated. Recombinant viruses derived from the clone were replication competent but unable to spread and establish new infections in Vero cells or primary human airway epithelial cells. Our findings suggest that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat. Recombination in the S1 subunit of the spike gene was identified as the primary mechanism driving variation in the spike phenotype and was likely one of the critical steps in the evolution and emergence of MERS-CoV in humans.","hesperidus bat sampled in Uganda (strain PREDICT/PDF-2180), further supporting the hypothesis that bats are the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV.

"The majority of recently emerging infectious diseases in humans is due to cross-species pathogen transmissions from animals. To establish a productive infection in new host species, viruses must overcome barriers to replication mediated by diverse and rapidly evolving host restriction factors such as protein kinase R (PKR). Many viral antagonists of these restriction factors are species specific. For example, the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist, RhTRS1, inhibits PKR in some African green monkey (AGM) cells, but does not inhibit human or rhesus macaque PKR. To model the evolutionary changes necessary for cross-species transmission, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses RhTRS1 in a strain that lacks PKR inhibitors E3L and K3L (VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1). Serially passaging VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 in minimally-permissive AGM cells increased viral replication 10- to 100-fold. Notably, adaptation in these AGM cells also improved virus replication 1000- to 10,000-fold in human and rhesus cells. Genetic analyses including deep sequencing revealed amplification of the rhtrs1 locus in the adapted viruses. Supplying additional rhtrs1 in trans confirmed that amplification alone was sufficient to improve VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 replication. Viruses with amplified rhtrs1 completely blocked AGM PKR, but only partially blocked human PKR, consistent with the replication properties of these viruses in AGM and human cells. Finally, in contrast to AGM-adapted viruses, which could be serially propagated in human cells, VVΔEΔK+RhTRS1 yielded no progeny virus after only three passages in human cells. Thus, rhtrs1 amplification in a minimally permissive intermediate host was a necessary step, enabling expansion of the virus range to previously nonpermissive hosts. These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.","['These_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'amplification', 'of', 'a_weak_viral_antagonist', 'may', 'be', 'a_general_evolutionary_mechanism', 'to', 'permit', 'replication', 'in', 'otherwise_resistant_host_species', ',', 'providing', 'a_molecular_foothold', 'that', 'could', 'enable', 'further_adaptations', 'necessary', 'for', 'efficient_replication', 'in', 'the_new_host', '.']","These_data support the_hypothesis that amplification of a_weak_viral_antagonist may be a_general_evolutionary_mechanism to permit replication in otherwise_resistant_host_species , providing a_molecular_foothold that could enable further_adaptations necessary for efficient_replication in the_new_host .","['These_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that amplification', 'a_weak_viral_antagonist', 'replication', 'otherwise_resistant_host_species', 'a_molecular_foothold', 'further_adaptations', 'efficient_replication', 'the_new_host']"
"BACKGROUND: Viral zoonosis, the transmission of a virus from its primary vertebrate reservoir species to humans, requires ubiquitous cellular proteins known as receptor proteins. Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.","We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_major_barrier', 'to', 'interspecies', 'virus_transmission', 'is', 'that', 'receptor_sequences', 'vary', 'among', 'species', '--', 'in', 'other_words', ',', 'that', 'the_specific_amino_acid_sequence', 'of', 'the_receptor', 'determines', 'the_ability', 'of', 'the_viral_envelope_protein', 'to', 'attach', 'to', 'the_cell', '.']","We hypothesized that the_major_barrier to interspecies virus_transmission is that receptor_sequences vary among species -- in other_words , that the_specific_amino_acid_sequence of the_receptor determines the_ability of the_viral_envelope_protein to attach to the_cell .","['interspecies', 'virus_transmission', 'receptor_sequences', 'species', 'the_specific_amino_acid_sequence', 'the_receptor', 'the_ability', 'the_viral_envelope_protein', 'the_cell']"
"Extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) migration into the decidua is critical for establishing placental perfusion and when dysregulated, may lead to pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; encoded by ABCG2) regulates the fusion of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts and protects the fetus from maternally derived xenobiotics. Information about BCRP function in EVTs is limited, however placental exposure to bacterial/viral infection leads to BCRP downregulation in syncitiotrophoblasts. We hypothesized that BCRP is involved in the regulation of EVT function and is modulated by infection/inflammation. We report that besides syncitiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts, BCRP is also expressed in EVTs. BCRP inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (human EVT-like) cells and in human EVT explant cultures, while not affecting cell proliferation. We have also shown that bacterial—lipopolysaccharide (LPS)—and viral antigens—single stranded RNA (ssRNA)—have a profound effect in downregulating ABCG2 and BCRP levels, whilst simultaneously increasing the migration potential of EVT-like cells. Our study reports a novel function of BCRP in early placentation and suggests that exposure of EVTs to maternal infection/inflammation could disrupt their migration potential via the downregulation of BCRP.

However, our recent cellular studies reveal that removing the Ubl2 domain from MERS PLpro has no effect on its ability to process the viral polyprotein or act as an interferon antagonist, which involves deubiquitinating and deISGylating cellular proteins. Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro. The X-ray structure of MERS PLpro-∆Ubl2 was determined to 1.9 Å and compared to PLpro containing the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. While the structures were nearly identical, the PLpro-∆Ubl2 enzyme revealed the intact structure of the substrate-binding loop. Moreover, PLpro-∆Ubl2 catalysis against different substrates and a purported inhibitor revealed no differences in catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and inhibition. Further, no changes in thermal stability were observed between enzymes. We conclude that the catalytic core of MERS PLpro, i.e. without the Ubl2 domain, is sufficient for catalysis and stability in vitro with utility to evaluate potential inhibitors as a platform for structure-based drug design.","Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro.","['Here', ',', 'we', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_Ubl2_domain', 'is', 'not', 'required', 'for', 'the_catalytic_function', 'of', 'MERS_PLpro', 'in', 'vitro', '.']","Here , we test the_hypothesis that the_Ubl2_domain is not required for the_catalytic_function of MERS_PLpro in vitro .","['the_hypothesis', 'the_Ubl2_domain', 'the_catalytic_function', 'MERS_PLpro', 'vitro']"
"The appearance of Cryptococcus gattii in the North American Pacific Northwest (PNW) in 1999 was an unexpected and is still an unexplained event. Recent phylogenomic analyses strongly suggest that this pathogenic fungus arrived in the PNW approximately 7 to 9 decades ago. In this paper, we theorize that the ancestors of the PNW C. gattii clones arrived in the area by shipborne transport, possibly in contaminated ballast, and established themselves in coastal waters early in the 20th century. In 1964, a tsunami flooded local coastal regions, transporting C. gattii to land. The occurrence of cryptococcosis in animals and humans 3 decades later suggests that adaptation to local environs took time, possibly requiring an increase in virulence and further dispersal. Tsunamis as a mechanism for the seeding of land with pathogenic waterborne microbes may have important implications for our understanding of how infectious diseases emerge in certain regions.

"Persistence, more recently termed the chlamydial stress response, is a viable but non-infectious state constituting a divergence from the characteristic chlamydial biphasic developmental cycle. Damage/danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are normal intracellular components or metabolites that, when released from cells, signal cellular damage/lysis. Purine metabolite DAMPs, including extracellular ATP and adenosine, inhibit chlamydial development in a species-specific manner. Viral co-infection has been shown to reversibly abrogate Chlamydia inclusion development, suggesting persistence/chlamydial stress. Because viral infection can cause host cell DAMP release, we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial development. Therefore, we examined the effect of extracellular ATP, adenosine, and cyclic AMP exposure, at 0 and 14 hours post infection, on C. pecorum and C. trachomatis serovar E development. In the absence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post or at 14 hours post infection reduced inclusion size; however, the effect was less robust upon 14 hours post infection exposure. Additionally, upon exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection, bacteria per inclusion and subsequent infectivity were reduced in both Chlamydia species. These effects were reversible, and C. pecorum exhibited more pronounced recovery from DAMP exposure. Aberrant bodies, typical in virus-induced chlamydial persistence, were absent upon DAMP exposure. In the presence of de novo host protein synthesis, exposure to DAMPs immediately post infection reduced inclusion size, but only variably modulated chlamydial infectivity. Because chlamydial infection and other infections may increase local DAMP concentrations, DAMPs may influence Chlamydia infection in vivo, particularly in the context of poly-microbial infections.","Because viral infection can cause host cell DAMP release, we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial development.","['Because', 'viral_infection', 'can', 'cause', 'host_cell_DAMP_release', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'DAMPs', 'may', 'influence', 'chlamydial_development', '.']","Because viral_infection can cause host_cell_DAMP_release , we hypothesized DAMPs may influence chlamydial_development .","['viral_infection', 'host_cell_DAMP_release', 'DAMPs', 'chlamydial_development']"
"Abstract We hypothesized that host antiviral genes induced by type I interferons might affect the natural course of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS-1), myxovirus resistance-A (MxA), and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase in 44 Vietnamese SARS patients with 103 controls. The G-allele of non-synonymous A/G SNP in exon 3 of OAS-1 gene showed association with SARS (p =0.0090). The G-allele in exon 3 of OAS-1 and the one in exon 6 were in strong linkage disequilibrium and both of them were associated with SARS infection. The GG genotype and G-allele of G/T SNP at position −88 in the MxA gene promoter were found more frequently in hypoxemic group than in non-hypoxemic group of SARS (p =0.0195).

"Structurally, Group 1 LILR (Leukocyte Immunogloblin (Ig)-Like Receptor, also known as Ig-like transcripts, ILT; Leukocyte Ig-like receptor, LIR; and CD85) members are very similar in terms of the HLAIs (human leukocyte antigen class I molecules) binding region and were hypothesized that they all bind to HLAIs.

"BACKGROUND: The wintertime co-occurrence of peaks in influenza and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is well documented, but how and whether wintertime peaks caused by these two pathogens are causally related is still uncertain. We aimed to investigate the relationship between influenza infection and IPD in Ontario, Canada, using several complementary methodological tools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated a total number of 38,501 positive influenza tests in Central Ontario and 6,191 episodes of IPD in the Toronto/Peel area, Ontario, Canada, between 1 January 1995 and 3 October 2009, reported through population-based surveillance. We assessed the relationship between the seasonal wave forms for influenza and IPD using fast Fourier transforms in order to examine the relationship between these two pathogens over yearly timescales. We also used three complementary statistical methods (time-series methods, negative binomial regression, and case-crossover methods) to evaluate the short-term effect of influenza dynamics on pneumococcal risk. Annual periodicity with wintertime peaks could be demonstrated for IPD, whereas periodicity for influenza was less regular. As for long-term effects, phase and amplitude terms of pneumococcal and influenza seasonal sine waves were not correlated and meta-analysis confirmed significant heterogeneity of influenza, but not pneumococcal phase terms. In contrast, influenza was shown to Granger-cause pneumococcal disease. A short-term association between IPD and influenza could be demonstrated for 1-week lags in both case-crossover (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.10 [1.02–1.18]) and negative binomial regression analysis (incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval] for one case of IPD per 100 influenza cases = 1.09 [1.05–1.14]). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that influenza influences bacterial disease incidence by enhancing short-term risk of invasion in colonized individuals. The absence of correlation between seasonal waveforms, on the other hand, suggests that bacterial disease transmission is affected to a lesser extent.

"Among RNA viruses, the order Nidovirales stands out for including viruses with the largest RNA genomes currently known. Nidoviruses employ a complex RNA-synthesizing machinery comprising a variety of non-structural proteins (nsps). One of the postulated drivers of the expansion of nidovirus genomes is the presence of a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease (ExoN) belonging to the DEDDh family. ExoN may enhance the fidelity of RNA synthesis by correcting nucleotide incorporation errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we review our current understanding of ExoN evolution, structure, and function. Most experimental data are derived from studies of the ExoN domain of coronaviruses (CoVs), which were triggered by the bioinformatics-based identification of ExoN in the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its relatives in 2003. Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized. Remarkably, viable ExoN knockout mutants were obtained only for two CoVs, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV, whose RNA synthesis and replication kinetics were mildly affected by the lack of ExoN function. In several other CoV species, ExoN inactivation was not tolerated, and knockout mutants could not be rescued when launched using a reverse genetics system. This suggests that ExoN is also critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, a property that poorly matches the profile of an enzyme that would merely boost long-term replication fidelity. In CoVs, ExoN resides in a bifunctional replicase subunit (nsp14) whose C-terminal part has (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp14 has shed light on the interplay between these two domains, and on nsp14’s interactions with nsp10, a co-factor that strongly enhances ExoN activity in vitro assays. Further elucidation of the structure-function relationships of ExoN and its interactions with other (viral and/or host) members of the CoV replication machinery will be key to understanding the enzyme’s role in viral RNA synthesis and pathogenesis, and may contribute to the design of new approaches to combat emerging nidoviruses.","Although convincing data supporting the proofreading hypothesis have been obtained, from biochemical assays and studies with CoV mutants lacking ExoN functionality, the features of ExoN from most other nidovirus families remain to be characterized.","['Although', 'convincing_data', 'supporting', 'the_proofreading_hypothesis', 'have', 'been', 'obtained', ',', 'from', 'biochemical_assays', 'and', 'studies', 'with', 'CoV_mutants', 'lacking', 'ExoN_functionality', ',', 'the_features', 'of', 'ExoN', 'from', 'most_other_nidovirus_families', 'remain', 'to', 'be', 'characterized', '.']","Although convincing_data supporting the_proofreading_hypothesis have been obtained , from biochemical_assays and studies with CoV_mutants lacking ExoN_functionality , the_features of ExoN from most_other_nidovirus_families remain to be characterized .","['convincing_data supporting the_proofreading_hypothesis', 'biochemical_assays', 'studies', 'CoV_mutants', 'ExoN_functionality', ', the_features', 'ExoN', 'most_other_nidovirus_families']"
"The PA-X protein is a fusion protein incorporating the N-terminal 191 amino acids of the PA protein with a short C-terminal sequence encoded by an overlapping ORF (X-ORF) in segment 3 that is accessed by + 1 ribosomal frameshifting, and this X-ORF exists in either full length or a truncated form (either 61-or 41-condons). Genetic evolution analysis indicates that all swine influenza viruses (SIVs) possessed full-length PA-X prior to 1985, but since then SIVs with truncated PA-X have gradually increased and become dominant, implying that truncation of this protein may contribute to the adaptation of influenza virus in pigs. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the background of a “triple-reassortment” H1N2 SIV with truncated PA-X, and evaluated their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Compared with full-length PA-X, SIV with truncated PA-X had increased viral replication in porcine cells and swine respiratory tissues, along with enhanced pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs. Furthermore, we found that truncation of PA-X improved the inhibition of IFN-I mRNA expression. Hereby, our results imply that truncation of PA-X may contribute to the adaptation of SIV in pigs.","To verify this hypothesis, we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the background of a “triple-reassortment” H1N2 SIV with truncated PA-X, and evaluated their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo.","['To', 'verify', 'this_hypothesis', ',', 'we', 'constructed', 'PA-X', 'extended', 'viruses', 'in', 'the_background', 'of', 'a_“triple-reassortment”_H1N2_SIV', 'with', 'truncated_PA-X', ',', 'and', 'evaluated', 'their_biological_characteristics', 'in', 'vitro', 'and', 'in', 'vivo', '.']","To verify this_hypothesis , we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the_background of a_“triple-reassortment”_H1N2_SIV with truncated_PA-X , and evaluated their_biological_characteristics in vitro and in vivo .","['PA-X extended viruses', 'the_background', 'a_“triple-reassortment”_H1N2_SIV', 'truncated_PA-X', 'their_biological_characteristics', 'vitro', 'vivo']"
"Viral replication occurs within cells, with release (and onward infection) primarily achieved through two alternative mechanisms: lysis, in which virions emerge as the infected cell dies and bursts open; or budding, in which virions emerge gradually from a still living cell by appropriating a small part of the cell membrane. Virus budding is a poorly understood process that challenges current models of vesicle formation. Here, a plausible mechanism for arenavirus budding is presented, building on recent evidence that viral proteins embed in the inner lipid layer of the cell membrane. Experimental results confirm that viral protein is associated with increased membrane curvature, whereas a mathematical model is used to show that localized increases in curvature alone are sufficient to generate viral buds. The magnitude of the protein-induced curvature is calculated from the size of the amphipathic region hypothetically removed from the inner membrane as a result of translation, with a change in membrane stiffness estimated from observed differences in virion deformation as a result of protein depletion. Numerical results are based on experimental data and estimates for three arenaviruses, but the mechanisms described are more broadly applicable. The hypothesized mechanism is shown to be sufficient to generate spontaneous budding that matches well both qualitatively and quantitatively with experimental observations.",The hypothesized mechanism is shown to be sufficient to generate spontaneous budding that matches,"['The_hypothesized_mechanism', 'is', 'shown', 'to', 'be', 'sufficient', 'to', 'generate', 'spontaneous', 'budding', 'that', 'matches']",The_hypothesized_mechanism is shown to be sufficient to generate spontaneous budding that matches,"['The_hypothesized_mechanism', 'matches']"
"BACKGROUND: Although pneumococcal pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death due to infectious diseases, little is known about pneumococci-lung cell interaction. Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x and cytokine induction was measured by RT-PCR, ELISA and Bioplex assay. JNK-phosphorylation was detected by Western blot and nuclear signaling was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JNK was modulated by the small molecule inhibitor SP600125 and AP1 by transfection of a dominant negative mutant. RESULTS: S. pneumoniae induced the release of distinct CC and CXC, as well as Th1 and Th2 cytokines and growth factors by human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Furthermore, pneumococci infection resulted in JNK phosphorylation in BEAS-2B cells. Inhibition of JNK by small molecule inhibitor SP600125 reduced pneumococci-induced IL-8 mRNA expression and release of IL-8 and IL-6. One regulator of the il8 promoter is JNK-phosphorylated activator protein 1 (AP-1). We showed that S. pneumoniae time-dependently induced DNA binding of AP-1 and its phosphorylated subunit c-Jun with a maximum at 3 to 5 h after infection. Recruitment of Ser(63/73)-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was found 2 h after S. pneumoniae infection by chromatin immunoprecipitation. AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release by TLR2-overexpressing HEK293 cells induced by pneumococci but not by TNFα. Antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 expression by human epithelial BEAS-2B cells depended on activation of JNK and recruitment of phosphorylated c-Jun to the il8 promoter.",Herein we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) METHODS: Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae,"['Herein', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'pneumococci', 'activated', 'pulmonary_epithelial_cell_cytokine_release', 'by', 'c', '-', 'Jun', '-', 'NH(2)-terminal', 'kinase', '(', 'JNK', ')', 'METHODS', ':', 'Human_bronchial_epithelial_cells', '(', 'BEAS-2B', ')', 'or', 'epithelial_HEK293_cells', 'were', 'infected', 'with', 'S._pneumoniae']",Herein we tested the_hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary_epithelial_cell_cytokine_release by c - Jun - NH(2)-terminal kinase ( JNK ) METHODS : Human_bronchial_epithelial_cells ( BEAS-2B ) or epithelial_HEK293_cells were infected with S._pneumoniae,"['Herein', 'the_hypothesis', 'pneumococci', 'pulmonary_epithelial_cell_cytokine_release', 'c', 'Jun', 'NH(2)-terminal', 'kinase', 'JNK', 'METHODS', 'Human_bronchial_epithelial_cells', 'BEAS-2B', 'epithelial_HEK293_cells', 'S._pneumoniae']"
"PTEN is a tyrosine phosphatase with significant function in inhibiting STAT3 activation. Recently, inactivation of STAT3 has been demonstrated as a therapeutic candidate for autoimmune arthritis. The expression of PTEN controlled by p53 regulates autoimmune arthritis through modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg. We hypothesized that PTEN regulated by p53 might reduce CIA severity and inflammatory response via inhibiting STAT3 activation. Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. We observed that PTEN expression downregulated by p53 deficiency induced the activation of STAT3. Loss of p53 exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and dysregulated the population of Th17 and Treg.

"Influenza viruses of avian origin continue to pose pandemic threats to human health. Some of the H5N1 and H9N2 virus subtypes induce markedly elevated cytokine levels when compared with the seasonal H1N1 virus. We previously showed that H5N1/97 hyperinduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the detailed mechanisms of p38MAPK activation and TNF-alpha hyperinduction following influenza virus infections are not known. Negative feedback regulations of cytokine expression play important roles in avoiding overwhelming production of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection. We investigated the roles of protein phosphatases including MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) in modulating p38MAPK activation and downstream TNF-alpha expressions in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (PBMac) infected with H9N2/G1 or H1N1 influenza virus. We demonstrate that H9N2/G1 virus activated p38MAPK and hyperinduced TNF-alpha production in PBMac when compared with H1N1 virus. H9N2/G1 induced PP2A activity in PBMac and, with the treatment of a PP2A inhibitor, p38MAPK phosphorylation and TNF-alpha production were further increased in the virus-infected macrophages. However, H9N2/G1 did not induce the expression of PP2A indicating that the activation of PP2A is not mediated by p38MAPK in virus-infected PBMac. On the other hand, PP2A may not be the targets of H9N2/G1 in the upstream of p38MAPK signaling pathways since H1N1 also induced PP2A activation in primary macrophages. Our results may provide new insights into the control of cytokine dysregulation.",Here we hypothesize that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of cytokine expressions during influenza virus infection.,"['Here', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'protein_phosphatases', 'are', 'involved', 'in', 'the_regulation', 'of', 'cytokine_expressions', 'during', 'influenza_virus_infection', '.']",Here we hypothesize that protein_phosphatases are involved in the_regulation of cytokine_expressions during influenza_virus_infection .,"['protein_phosphatases', 'the_regulation', 'cytokine_expressions', 'influenza_virus_infection']"
"Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures.","We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_availability', 'of', 'rapid', ',', 'multiplex_PCR_diagnostics', 'will', 'provide', 'better_clinical_care', 'and', 'new_insights', 'into', 'the_etiology_and_clinical_spectrum', 'of', 'RTIs', '.']","We hypothesize that the_availability of rapid , multiplex_PCR_diagnostics will provide better_clinical_care and new_insights into the_etiology_and_clinical_spectrum of RTIs .","['the_availability', 'multiplex_PCR_diagnostics', 'the_etiology_and_clinical_spectrum', 'RTIs']"
"T-cell neoplasms have poor prognosis and few effective therapeutic options. Therefore, identification of factors in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that are associated with cancer progression may represent novel therapeutic targets. Recent studies have highlighted a previously unappreciated role for the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on T cells and their effects on cell survival and proliferation. TLRs can bind exogenous molecules derived from pathogens as well as endogenous self-ligands released from damaged cells. Recent reports demonstrate that TLR engagement on primary mouse or human T cells enhances proliferation and/or cell survival. The mechanisms by which TLR stimulation on T cells influences these parameters and the different T-cell subsets that are affected by TLR stimulation are currently under investigation. Furthermore, neither the biological importance of stimulating TLRs on neoplastic T cells nor the prevalence of TLR expression in T-cell malignancies have yet to be characterized. Based on published reports and compelling preliminary data, we propose that the activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway in neoplastic T cells contributes to disease progression by reducing cell death and enhancing cell division.

"The ongoing decline of honey bee health worldwide is a serious economic and ecological concern. One major contributor to the decline are pathogens, including several honey bee viruses. However, information is limited on the biology of bee viruses and molecular interactions with their hosts. An experimental protocol to test these systems was developed, using injections of Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) into honey bee pupae reared ex-situ under laboratory conditions. The infected pupae developed pronounced but variable patterns of disease. Symptoms varied from complete cessation of development with no visual evidence of disease to rapid darkening of a part or the entire body. Considerable differences in IAPV titer dynamics were observed, suggesting significant variation in resistance to IAPV among and possibly within honey bee colonies. Thus, selective breeding for virus resistance should be possible. Gene expression analyses of three separate experiments suggest IAPV disruption of transcriptional homeostasis of several fundamental cellular functions, including an up-regulation of the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These results provide first insights into the mechanisms of IAPV pathogenicity.

"Study objectives The inflammatory responses and associated clinical severity of COPD exacerbations are greatly variable, and the determinants of these factors are poorly understood. We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (108.56 cfu/mL vs 108.05cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. Conclusions The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.",We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD.,"['We', 'examined', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'bacteria', 'and', 'viruses', 'may', 'modulate', 'this_heterogeneity', 'and', 'that', 'interactions', 'between', 'bacterial_and_viral_infection', 'may', 'affect', 'changes', 'in', 'airway_bacterial_load', 'and', 'the_clinical_features', 'and', 'inflammatory_responses', 'of', 'exacerbations', 'in', 'patients', 'with', 'COPD', '.']",We examined the_hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this_heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial_and_viral_infection may affect changes in airway_bacterial_load and the_clinical_features and inflammatory_responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD .,"['the_hypothesis', 'bacteria', 'viruses', 'this_heterogeneity', 'interactions', 'bacterial_and_viral_infection', 'changes', 'the_clinical_features', 'inflammatory_responses', 'exacerbations', 'patients', 'COPD']"
"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, central nervous system disease mediated by myelin-specific T cells. Environmental triggers that cause a breakdown of myelin-specific T cell tolerance are unknown. We found that CD8(+) myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell tolerance can be broken and autoimmunity induced by infection with a virus that does not express MBP cross-reactive epitopes and does not depend on bystander activation. Instead, the virus activated dual T cell receptor (TCR)-expressing T cells capable of recognizing both MBP and viral antigens. These results demonstrate the importance of dual TCR T cells in autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected individuals, as hypothesized in the etiology of MS.","These results demonstrate the importance of dual TCR T cells in autoimmunity and suggest a mechanism by which a ubiquitous viral infection could trigger autoimmunity in a subset of infected individuals, as hypothesized in the etiology of MS.","['These_results', 'demonstrate', 'the_importance', 'of', 'dual_TCR_T_cells', 'in', 'autoimmunity', 'and', 'suggest', 'a_mechanism', 'by', 'which', 'a_ubiquitous_viral_infection', 'could', 'trigger', 'autoimmunity', 'in', 'a_subset', 'of', 'infected_individuals', ',', 'as', 'hypothesized', 'in', 'the_etiology', 'of', 'MS', '.']","These_results demonstrate the_importance of dual_TCR_T_cells in autoimmunity and suggest a_mechanism by which a_ubiquitous_viral_infection could trigger autoimmunity in a_subset of infected_individuals , as hypothesized in the_etiology of MS .","['These_results', 'the_importance', 'dual_TCR_T_cells', 'autoimmunity', 'a_mechanism', 'a_ubiquitous_viral_infection', 'autoimmunity', 'a_subset', 'infected_individuals', 'the_etiology', 'MS']"
"The immune system rapidly responds to intracellular infections by detecting MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes presented on infected cells. It was originally thought that viral peptides are liberated during constitutive protein turnover, but this conflicts with the observation that viral epitopes are detected within minutes of their synthesis even when their source proteins exhibit half-lives of days. The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products. One potential source of DRiPs is premature translation termination. If this is a major source of DRiPs, this should be reflected in positional bias towards the N-terminus. By contrast, if downstream initiation is a major source of DRiPs, there should be positional bias towards the C-terminus. Here, we systematically assessed positional bias of epitopes in viral antigens, exploiting the large set of data available in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We show a statistically significant degree of positional skewing among epitopes; epitopes from both ends of antigens tend to be under-represented. Centric-skewing correlates with a bias towards class I binding peptides being over-represented in the middle, in parallel with a higher degree of evolutionary conservation.","The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products.","['The_DRiPs_hypothesis', 'proposes', 'that', 'epitopes', 'derive', 'from', 'Defective_Ribosomal_Products', '(', 'DRiPs', ')', ',', 'rather', 'than', 'degradation', 'of', 'mature_protein_products', '.']","The_DRiPs_hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective_Ribosomal_Products ( DRiPs ) , rather than degradation of mature_protein_products .","['The_DRiPs_hypothesis', 'epitopes', 'Defective_Ribosomal_Products', 'DRiPs', 'degradation', 'mature_protein_products']"
"The half-time for secretion of the plasma protein C-reactive protein (CRP) by the hepatocyte decreases markedly in association with its increased synthesis during the acute phase response to tissue injury (Macintyre, S., D. Samols, and I. Kushner. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:4169-4173). In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent- dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium binding studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (Kd = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response.",These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response.,"['These_findings', 'correlate', 'with', 'previous_observations', 'of', 'changes', 'in', 'secretion_kinetics', 'of', 'CRP', 'and', 'are', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_intracellular_sorting', 'of', 'CRP', 'could', 'be', 'rerouted', 'by', 'downregulation', 'of', 'a_specific_ER_binding_site', 'during', 'the_acute_phase_response', '.']",These_findings correlate with previous_observations of changes in secretion_kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the_hypothesis that the_intracellular_sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a_specific_ER_binding_site during the_acute_phase_response .,"['These_findings', 'previous_observations', 'changes', 'CRP', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_intracellular_sorting', 'CRP', 'downregulation', 'a_specific_ER_binding_site', 'the_acute_phase_response']"
"BACKGROUND: One of the major obstacles in the design of an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is the hypervariability of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. Most HIV-1 vaccine candidates have utilized envelope glycoprotein from a single virus isolate, but to date, none of them elicited broadly reactive humoral immunity. Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1. We compared and evaluated the immunogenicity of HIV-1 vaccines containing either gp120 protein alone or in combinations of four or fourteen gp120s from different primary HIV-1 isolates in immunized hamsters. RESULTS: We amplified and characterized 14 different gp120s from primary subtype B isolates with both syncytium and non-syncytium inducing properties, and expressed the proteins in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Purified proteins were used either alone or in combinations of four or fourteen different gp120s to vaccinate golden hamsters. The polyvalent vaccine showed higher antibody titers to HIV-1 subtype B isolates MN and SF162 compared to the groups that received one or four gp120 proteins. However, the polyvalent vaccine was not able to show higher neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 primary isolates. Interestingly, the polyvalent vaccine group had the highest proliferative immune responses and showed a substantial proportion of cross-subtype CD4 reactivity to HIV-1 subtypes B, C, and A/E CONCLUSION: Although the polyvalent approach achieved only a modest increase in the breadth of humoral and cellular immunity, the qualitative change in the vaccine (14 vs. 1 gp120) resulted in a quantitative improvement in vaccine-induced immunity.","Herein, we hypothesised that a cocktail of HIV-1 gp120 proteins containing multiple epitopes may increase the breadth of immune responses against HIV-1.","['Herein', ',', 'we', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'a_cocktail', 'of', 'HIV-1_gp120_proteins', 'containing', 'multiple_epitopes', 'may', 'increase', 'the_breadth', 'of', 'immune_responses', 'against', 'HIV-1', '.']","Herein , we hypothesised that a_cocktail of HIV-1_gp120_proteins containing multiple_epitopes may increase the_breadth of immune_responses against HIV-1 .","['Herein', 'a_cocktail', 'HIV-1_gp120_proteins', 'multiple_epitopes', 'the_breadth', 'immune_responses', 'HIV-1']"
"Abstract Background Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are common causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in hematologic malignancy (HM) patients. Predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including the impact of HRV species and types are poorly understood. Objectives This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular epidemiology of HRV infections among HM patients. Study design From April 2012–March 2013, HRV-positive respiratory specimens from symptomatic HM patients were molecularly characterized by analysis of partial viral protein 1 (VP1) or VP4 gene sequence. HRV LRTI risk-factors and outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results One hundred and ten HM patients presented with HRV URTI (n =78) and HRV LRTI (n =32). Hypoalbuminemia (OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0–9.2; p =0.05) was independently associated with LRTI, but other clinical and laboratory markers of host immunity did not differ between patients with URTI versus LRTI. Detection of bacterial co-pathogens was common in LRTI cases (25%). Among 92 typeable respiratory specimens, there were 58 (64%) HRV-As, 12 (13%) HRV-Bs, and 21 (23%) HRV-Cs, and one Enterovirus 68. LRTI rates among HRV-A (29%), HRV-B (17%), and HRV-C (29%) were similar. HRV-A infections occurred year-round while HRV-B and HRV-C infections clustered in the late fall and winter. Conclusions HRVs are associated with LRTI in HM patients. Illness severity is not attributable to specific HRV species or types. The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.","The frequent detection of bacterial co-pathogens in HRV LRTIs further substantiates the hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial superinfection of the lower airways, similar to that of other community-acquired respiratory viruses.","['The_frequent_detection', 'of', 'bacterial_co-pathogens', 'in', 'HRV_LRTIs', 'further', 'substantiates', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'HRVs', 'predispose', 'to', 'bacterial_superinfection', 'of', 'the_lower_airways', ',', 'similar', 'to', 'that', 'of', 'other_community-acquired_respiratory_viruses', '.']","The_frequent_detection of bacterial_co-pathogens in HRV_LRTIs further substantiates the_hypothesis that HRVs predispose to bacterial_superinfection of the_lower_airways , similar to that of other_community-acquired_respiratory_viruses .","['The_frequent_detection', 'bacterial_co-pathogens', 'HRV_LRTIs', 'the_hypothesis', 'HRVs', 'bacterial_superinfection', 'the_lower_airways', 'other_community-acquired_respiratory_viruses']"
"BACKGROUND: Feline coronavirus (FCoV) exists as two pathotypes, and FCoV spike gene mutations are considered responsible for the pathotypic switch in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) specifically designed to detect FCoV spike gene mutations at two nucleotide positions. It was hypothesized that this test would correctly discriminate feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). METHODS: The study included 63 cats with signs consistent with FIP. FIP was confirmed in 38 cats. Twenty-five control cats were definitively diagnosed with a disease other than FIP. Effusion and/or serum/plasma samples were examined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the two FCoV spike gene fusion peptide mutations M1058 L and S1060A using an allelic discrimination approach. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: FIPV was detected in the effusion of 25/59 cats, one of them being a control cat with chronic kidney disease. A mixed population of FIPV/FECV was detected in the effusion of 2/59 cats; all of them had FIP. RT-PCR was negative or the pathotype could not be determined in 34/59 effusion samples. In effusion, sensitivity was 68.6% (95% CI 50.7–83.2), specificity was 95.8% (95% CI 78.9–99.9). No serum/plasma samples were positive for FIPV. CONCLUSIONS: Although specificity of the test in effusions was high, one false positive result occurred.

"Vuvuzelas, the plastic blowing horns used by sports fans, recently achieved international recognition during the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament in South Africa. We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols. To investigate the quantity and size of aerosols emitted when the instrument is played, eight healthy volunteers were asked to blow a vuvuzela. For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 658×10(3) per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.7×10(3) per litre for shouting, representing a mean log(10) difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p<0.001). The majority (>97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons. Further investigation is required to assess the potential of the vuvuzela to contribute to the transmission of aerosol borne diseases. We recommend, as a precautionary measure, that people with respiratory infections should be advised not to blow their vuvuzela in enclosed spaces and where there is a risk of infecting others.",We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols.,"['We', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'vuvuzelas', 'might', 'facilitate', 'the_generation', 'and', 'dissemination', 'of', 'respiratory_aerosols', '.']",We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the_generation and dissemination of respiratory_aerosols .,"['vuvuzelas', 'the_generation', 'dissemination', 'respiratory_aerosols']"
"Porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome (PRRS) is a viral pandemic that especially affects neonates within the “critical window” of immunological development. PRRS was recognized in 1987 and within a few years became pandemic causing an estimated yearly $600,000 economic loss in the USA with comparative losses in most other countries. The causative agent is a single-stranded, positive-sense enveloped arterivirus (PRRSV) that infects macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Despite the discovery of PRRSV in 1991 and the publication of >2,000 articles, the control of PRRS is problematic. Despite the large volume of literature on this disease, the cellular and molecular mechanisms describing how PRRSV dysregulates the host immune system are poorly understood. We know that PRRSV suppresses innate immunity and causes abnormal B cell proliferation and repertoire development, often lymphopenia and thymic atrophy. The PRRSV genome is highly diverse, rapidly evolving but amenable to the generation of many mutants and chimeric viruses for experimental studies. PRRSV only replicates in swine which adds to the experimental difficulty since no inbred well-defined animal models are available. In this article, we summarize current knowledge and apply it toward developing a series of provocative and testable hypotheses to explain how PRRSV immunomodulates the porcine immune system with the goal of adding new perspectives on this disease.","In this article, we summarize current knowledge and apply it toward developing a series of provocative and testable hypotheses to explain how PRRSV immunomodulates the porcine immune system with the goal of adding new perspectives on this disease.","['In', 'this_article', ',', 'we', 'summarize', 'current_knowledge', 'and', 'apply', 'it', 'toward', 'developing', 'a_series', 'of', 'provocative_and_testable_hypotheses', 'to', 'explain', 'how', 'PRRSV', 'immunomodulates', 'the_porcine_immune_system', 'with', 'the_goal', 'of', 'adding', 'new_perspectives', 'on', 'this_disease', '.']","In this_article , we summarize current_knowledge and apply it toward developing a_series of provocative_and_testable_hypotheses to explain how PRRSV immunomodulates the_porcine_immune_system with the_goal of adding new_perspectives on this_disease .","['this_article', 'current_knowledge', 'a_series', 'provocative_and_testable_hypotheses', 'PRRSV', 'the_goal', 'new_perspectives', 'this_disease']"
"BACKGROUND: The model of epidemiologic transitions has served as a guiding framework for understanding relationships between patterns of human health and disease and economic development for the past several decades. However, epidemiologic transition theory is infrequently employed in epidemiology. OBJECTIVE: Moving beyond Omran's original formulation, we discuss critiques and modifications of the theory of epidemiologic transitions and highlight some of the ways in which incorporating epidemiologic transition theory can benefit theory and practice in epidemiology. DESIGN: We focus on two broad contemporary trends in human health that epidemiologic transition theory is useful for conceptualizing: the increased incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs), such as allergic and autoimmune diseases, and the emergence and reemergence of infectious disease. RESULTS: Situating these trends within epidemiologic transition theory, we explain the rise in CIDs with the hygiene hypothesis and the rise in emerging and reemerging infections with the concept of a third epidemiologic transition. CONCLUSIONS: Contextualizing these trends within epidemiologic transition theory reveals implications for clinical practice, global health policies, and future research within epidemiology.","Situating these trends within epidemiologic transition theory, we explain the rise in CIDs with the hygiene hypothesis and the rise in emerging and reemerging infections with the concept of a third epidemiologic transition.","['Situating', 'these_trends', 'within', 'epidemiologic_transition_theory', ',', 'we', 'explain', 'the_rise', 'in', 'CIDs', 'with', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', 'and', 'the_rise', 'in', 'emerging_and_reemerging_infections', 'with', 'the_concept', 'of', 'a_third_epidemiologic_transition', '.']","Situating these_trends within epidemiologic_transition_theory , we explain the_rise in CIDs with the_hygiene_hypothesis and the_rise in emerging_and_reemerging_infections with the_concept of a_third_epidemiologic_transition .","['these_trends', 'epidemiologic_transition_theory', 'CIDs', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', 'the_rise', 'emerging_and_reemerging_infections', 'the_concept', 'a_third_epidemiologic_transition']"
"Vitamin A (VA) has pleiotropic effects on the immune system and is critical for mucosal immune function and intestinal lymphocyte trafficking. We hypothesized that oral VA supplementation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)-infected pregnant gilts would enhance the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA axis to boost lactogenic immunity and passive protection of nursing piglets against PEDV challenge. Gilts received daily oral retinyl acetate (30 000 IU) starting at gestation day 76 throughout lactation. At 3–4 weeks pre-partum, VA-supplemented (PEDV + VA) and non-supplemented (PEDV) gilts were PEDV or mock inoculated (mock + VA and mock, respectively). PEDV + VA gilts had decreased mean PEDV RNA shedding titers and diarrhea scores. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3–5 days post-partum. The survival rate of PEDV + VA litters was 74.2% compared with 55.9% in PEDV litters. Mock and mock + VA litter survival rates were 5.7% and 8.3%, respectively. PEDV + VA gilts had increased PEDV IgA antibody secreting cells and PEDV IgA antibodies in serum pre-partum and IgA(+)β7(+) (gut homing) cells in milk post piglet challenge compared with PEDV gilts.

"Abstract The live-attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccine based on the Hu191 strain has played a significant role in controlling measles in China. However, it has considerable adverse effects that may cause public health burden. We hypothesize that the safety and efficacy of MV vaccine can be improved by altering the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site in the conserved region VI of the large polymerase protein. To test this hypothesis, we established an efficient reverse genetics system for the rMV-Hu191 strain and generated two recombinant MV-Hu191 carrying mutations in the SAM binding site. These two mutants grew to high titer in Vero cells, were genetically stable, and were significantly more attenuated in vitro and in vivo compared to the parental rMV-Hu191 vaccine strain. Importantly, both MV-Hu191 mutants triggered a higher neutralizing antibody than rMV-Hu191 vaccine and provided complete protection against MV challenge.

"Prior studies of clay–virus interactions have focused on the stability and infectivity of nonenveloped viruses, yielding contradictory results. We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species φ6 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between φ6 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT–φ6 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edge-attached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.","We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_surface_charge_distribution', 'of', 'the_clay_and_virus_envelope', 'dictates', 'how', 'the_components', 'react', 'and', 'affect', 'aggregation', ',', 'viral_stability', ',', 'and', 'infectivity', '.']","We hypothesize that the_surface_charge_distribution of the_clay_and_virus_envelope dictates how the_components react and affect aggregation , viral_stability , and infectivity .","['the_surface_charge_distribution', 'dictates', 'the_components', 'aggregation', 'viral_stability', 'infectivity']"
"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous preterm birth (SPB, before 37 gestational weeks) is a major cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarray to profile essentially all human genes, we observed that 426 probe signals were changed by >2.9-fold in the SPB placentas, compared with the spontaneous term birth (STB) placentas. Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (≤32.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056). CONCLUSION: We have identified 36 SPB-associated RNA transcripts, which are possibly detectable in maternal plasma. We have illustrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA was more frequently detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples collected from women resulting in SPB than the gestational-age matched controls.","We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'SPB', 'involves', 'aberrant_placental_RNA_expression', ',', 'and', 'that', 'such_RNA_transcripts', 'can', 'be', 'detected', 'in', 'predelivery_maternal_plasma_samples', ',', 'which', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'with', 'gestational_age-matched_controls', '.']","We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant_placental_RNA_expression , and that such_RNA_transcripts can be detected in predelivery_maternal_plasma_samples , which can be compared with gestational_age-matched_controls .","['SPB', 'aberrant_placental_RNA_expression', 'such_RNA_transcripts', 'predelivery_maternal_plasma_samples', 'gestational_age-matched_controls']"
"Abstract We have previously observed that all known HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are highly divergent from germline antibodies in contrast to bnAbs against Hendra virus, Nipah virus and SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs they may not bind the epitopes of the mature antibodies and provided the first evidence to support this hypothesis by using individual putative germline-like predecessor antibodies. To further validate the hypothesis and understand initial immune responses to different viruses, two phage-displayed human cord blood-derived IgM libraries were constructed which contained mostly germline antibodies or antibodies with very low level of somatic hypermutations. They were panned against different HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs), SARS CoV protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and soluble Hendra virus G protein (sG). Despite a high sequence and combinatorial diversity observed in the cord blood-derived IgM antibody repertoire, no enrichment for binders of Envs was observed in contrast to considerable specific enrichments produced with panning against RBD and sG; one of the selected monoclonal antibodies (against the RBD) was of high (nM) affinity with only few somatic mutations. These results further support and expand our initial hypothesis for fundamental differences in immune responses leading to elicitation of bnAbs against HIV-1 compared to SARS CoV and Hendra virus. HIV-1 uses a strategy to minimize or eliminate strong binding of germline antibodies to its Env; in contrast, SARS CoV and Hendra virus, and perhaps other viruses causing acute infections, can bind germline antibody or minimally somatically mutated antibodies with relatively high affinity which could be one of the reasons for the success of sG and RBD as vaccine immunogens.",We have hypothesized that because the germline antibodies are so different from the mature HIV-1-specific bnAbs,"['We', 'have', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'because', 'the_germline_antibodies', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'from', 'the_mature_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs']",We have hypothesized that because the_germline_antibodies are so different from the_mature_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs,"['the_germline_antibodies', 'the_mature_HIV-1-specific_bnAbs']"
"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a member of the Birnaviridae family, is a major avian pathogen responsible for an immunosuppressive disease affecting juvenile chickens. The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding. Data gathered with IBDV mutants expressing C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides generated by reverse genetics demonstrate that the VP5-PIP binding domain is required both for its PM targeting in infected cells, and for efficient virus dissemination. Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.",Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.,"['Data', 'presented', 'here', 'lead', 'us', 'to', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'IBDV', 'might', 'use', 'a', 'non', '-', 'lytic', 'VP5-dependent', 'cell', '-', 'to', '-', 'cell', 'spreading', 'mechanism', '.']",Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non - lytic VP5-dependent cell - to - cell spreading mechanism .,"['Data', 'IBDV', 'VP5-dependent', 'cell', 'cell', 'mechanism']"
"As a group of disorders, autoimmunity ranks as the third most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western World. However, the etiology of most autoimmune diseases remains unknown. Although genetic linkage studies support a critical underlying role for genetics, the geographic distribution of these disorders as well as the low concordance rates in monozygotic twins suggest that a combination of other factors including environmental ones are involved. Virus infection is a primary factor that has been implicated in the initiation of autoimmune disease. Infection triggers a robust and usually well-coordinated immune response that is critical for viral clearance. However, in some instances, immune regulatory mechanisms may falter, culminating in the breakdown of self-tolerance, resulting in immune-mediated attack directed against both viral and self-antigens. Traditionally, cross-reactive T-cell recognition, known as molecular mimicry, as well as bystander T-cell activation, culminating in epitope spreading, have been the predominant mechanisms elucidated through which infection may culminate in an T-cell-mediated autoimmune response. However, other hypotheses including virus-induced decoy of the immune system also warrant discussion in regard to their potential for triggering autoimmunity. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which virus infection and antiviral immunity contribute to the development of autoimmunity.","However, other hypotheses including virus-induced decoy of the immune system also warrant discussion in regard to their potential for triggering autoimmunity.","['However', ',', 'other_hypotheses', 'including', 'virus-induced_decoy', 'of', 'the_immune_system', 'also', 'warrant', 'discussion', 'in', 'regard', 'to', 'their_potential', 'for', 'triggering', 'autoimmunity', '.']","However , other_hypotheses including virus-induced_decoy of the_immune_system also warrant discussion in regard to their_potential for triggering autoimmunity .","['other_hypotheses', 'virus-induced_decoy', 'the_immune_system', 'discussion', 'regard', 'their_potential', 'autoimmunity']"
"BACKGROUND: Recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM, recurrent ear infection) is a common childhood disease caused by bacteria termed otopathogens, for which current treatments have limited effectiveness. Generic probiotic therapies have shown promise, but seem to lack specificity. We hypothesised that healthy children with no history of AOM carry protective commensal bacteria that could be translated into a specific probiotic therapy to break the cycle of re-infection. We characterised the nasopharyngeal microbiome of these children (controls) in comparison to children with rAOM (cases) to identify potentially protective bacteria. As some children with rAOM do not appear to carry any of the known otopathogens, we also hypothesised that characterisation of the middle ear microbiome could identify novel otopathogens, which may also guide the development of more effective therapies. RESULTS: Middle ear fluids, middle ear rinses and ear canal swabs from the cases and nasopharyngeal swabs from both groups underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The nasopharyngeal microbiomes of cases and controls were distinct. We observed a significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum in the nasopharynx of controls. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella were abundant in the middle ear and ear canal of cases, but were uncommon in the nasopharynx of both groups. Gemella and Neisseria were characteristic of the case nasopharynx, but were not prevalent in the middle ear. CONCLUSIONS: Corynebacterium and Dolosigranulum are characteristic of a healthy nasopharyngeal microbiome. Alloiococcus, Staphylococcus and Turicella are possible novel otopathogens, though their rarity in the nasopharynx and prevalence in the ear canal means that their role as normal aural flora cannot be ruled out. Gemella and Neisseria are unlikely to be novel otopathogens as they do not appear to colonise the middle ear in children with rAOM.

"BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children worldwide. Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To investigate the potential role of DC-SIGNR in MTCT of HIV-1, we carried out a genetic association study of DC-SIGNR in a well-characterized cohort of 197 HIV-infected mothers and their infants recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. Infants harbouring two copies of DC-SIGNR H1 and/or H3 haplotypes (H1-H1, H1-H3, H3-H3) had a 3.6-fold increased risk of in utero (IU) (P = 0.013) HIV-1 infection and a 5.7-fold increased risk of intrapartum (IP) (P = 0.025) HIV-1 infection after adjusting for a number of maternal factors. The implicated H1 and H3 haplotypes share two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in promoter region (p-198A) and intron 2 (int2-180A) that were associated with increased risk of both IU (P = 0.045 and P = 0.003, respectively) and IP (P = 0.025, for int2-180A) HIV-1 infection. The promoter variant reduced transcriptional activity in vitro. In homozygous H1 infants bearing both the p-198A and int2-180A mutations, we observed a 4-fold decrease in the level of placental DC-SIGNR transcripts, disproportionately affecting the expression of membrane-bound isoforms compared to infant noncarriers (P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DC-SIGNR plays a crucial role in MTCT of HIV-1 and that impaired placental DC-SIGNR expression increases risk of transmission.","Given that the C-type lectin receptor, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin-related (DC-SIGNR, also known as CD209L or liver/lymph node–specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (L-SIGN)), can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the maternal-fetal interface, we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1.","['Given', 'that', 'the_C-type_lectin_receptor', ',', 'dendritic_cell-specific_ICAM-grabbing_non-integrin-related_(DC-SIGNR', ',', 'also', 'known', 'as', 'CD209L', 'or', 'liver', '/', 'lymph', 'node', '–', 'specific_ICAM-grabbing_non-integrin', '(', 'L', '-', 'SIGN', ')', ')', ',', 'can', 'interact', 'with', 'pathogens', 'including', 'HIV-1', 'and', 'is', 'expressed', 'at', 'the_maternal-fetal_interface', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'it', 'could', 'influence', 'MTCT', 'of', 'HIV-1', '.']","Given that the_C-type_lectin_receptor , dendritic_cell-specific_ICAM-grabbing_non-integrin-related_(DC-SIGNR , also known as CD209L or liver / lymph node – specific_ICAM-grabbing_non-integrin ( L - SIGN ) ) , can interact with pathogens including HIV-1 and is expressed at the_maternal-fetal_interface , we hypothesized that it could influence MTCT of HIV-1 .","['the_C-type_lectin_receptor', 'CD209L or liver / lymph node', 'specific_ICAM-grabbing_non-integrin', '( L - SIGN', 'pathogens', 'HIV-1', 'the_maternal-fetal_interface', 'MTCT', 'HIV-1']"
"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus responsible for a lethal pig disease, to which no vaccine has ever been obtained. Its genome encodes a number of proteins involved in virus survival and transmission in its hosts, in particular proteins that inhibit signaling pathways in infected macrophages and, thus, interfere with the host's innate immune response. A recently identified novel ASFV viral protein (pI329L) was found to inhibit the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) signaling pathway, TLR3 being a crucial “danger detector.” pI329L has been predicted to be a transmembrane protein containing extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar to TLR3, suggesting that pI329L might act as a TLR3 decoy. To explore this idea, we used comparative modeling and other structure prediction protocols to propose (a) a model for the TLR3–Toll-interleukin-1 receptor homodimer and (b) a structural fold for pI329L, detailed at atomistic level for its cytoplasmic domain. As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.","The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.","['The_final_pI329L_model', 'presents', 'a_plausible_fold', ',', 'good_structural_quality', ',', 'is', 'consistent', 'with', 'the_available_experimental_data', ',', 'and', 'it', 'corroborates', 'our_hypothesis', 'of', 'pI329L', 'being', 'a_TLR3_antagonist', '.']","The_final_pI329L_model presents a_plausible_fold , good_structural_quality , is consistent with the_available_experimental_data , and it corroborates our_hypothesis of pI329L being a_TLR3_antagonist .","['The_final_pI329L_model', 'a_plausible_fold', 'good_structural_quality', 'the_available_experimental_data', 'our_hypothesis', 'pI329L']"
"Abstract Viruses depend on their host's cellular structure to survive. Most of them do not have tRNAs, their translation relies on hosts' tRNA pools. Over the course of evolution, viruses needed to optimally exploit cellular processes of their host. Thus, codon usage of a virus should coevolve with its host to efficiently and rapidly replicate. Some viruses can invade a broad spectrum of hosts (BSTVs), while others can invade a narrow spectrum only (NSTVs). Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts. We compare the patterns of codon usage in 255 virus genomes to test this hypothesis. Our results show that NSTVs have a higher degree of matching to their hosts' tRNA pools than BSTVs. Further, analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) infers that codon usage bias of NSTVs is relatively stronger than that of BSTVs. Thus, codon usage of NSTVs tends to better match their host than that of BSTVs. This supports the hypothesis that viruses adapt to the expression system of their host(s).","Consequently, we test the hypothesis that similarity of codon usage preference and the degree of matching between BSTVs and their hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs, which only need to coevolve with few hosts.","['Consequently', ',', 'we', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'similarity', 'of', 'codon_usage_preference', 'and', 'the_degree', 'of', 'matching', 'between', 'BSTVs', 'and', 'their_hosts', 'will', 'be', 'lower', 'than', 'that', 'of', 'NSTVs', ',', 'which', 'only', 'need', 'to', 'coevolve', 'with', 'few_hosts', '.']","Consequently , we test the_hypothesis that similarity of codon_usage_preference and the_degree of matching between BSTVs and their_hosts will be lower than that of NSTVs , which only need to coevolve with few_hosts .","['the_hypothesis', 'that similarity', 'codon_usage_preference', 'the_degree', 'BSTVs', 'their_hosts', 'NSTVs', 'few_hosts']"
"BACKGROUND: China's one-child-per-couple policy, introduced in 1979, led to profound demographic changes for nearly a quarter of the world's population. Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, −0.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population.","We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy.","['We', 'also', 'forecasted', 'influenza_transmission', 'over', 'a_ten-year_time_period', 'in', 'a_population', 'with', 'a_two-child_policy', 'under', 'a_hypothesis', 'that', 'a', 'two', '-', 'child', '-', 'per', '-', 'couple', 'policy', 'will', 'be', 'carried', 'out', 'in', '2015', ',', 'and', 'found', 'a_negligible_difference', 'in', 'the_average_annual_attack_rate', 'compared', 'to', 'the_population', 'with', 'the_one-child_policy', '.']","We also forecasted influenza_transmission over a_ten-year_time_period in a_population with a_two-child_policy under a_hypothesis that a two - child - per - couple policy will be carried out in 2015 , and found a_negligible_difference in the_average_annual_attack_rate compared to the_population with the_one-child_policy .","['influenza_transmission', 'a_ten-year_time_period', 'a_population', 'a_two-child_policy', 'a_hypothesis', 'child', 'couple', 'policy', 'a_negligible_difference', 'the_average_annual_attack_rate', 'the_population', 'the_one-child_policy']"
"Viral infections are an important cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs or vaccines for a large number of viruses, and this represents a remarkable challenge particularly for emerging and re-emerging viruses. For this reason, the identification of broad spectrum antiviral compounds provides a valuable opportunity for developing efficient antiviral therapies. Here we report on a class of rhodanine and thiobarbituric derivatives displaying a broad spectrum antiviral activity against seven different enveloped viruses including an HSV-2 acyclovir resistant strain with favorable selectivity indexes. Due to their selective action on enveloped viruses and to their lipid oxidation ability, we hypothesize a mechanism on the viral envelope that affects the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, thus compromising the efficiency of virus-cell fusion and preventing viral entry.","Due to their selective action on enveloped viruses and to their lipid oxidation ability, we hypothesize a mechanism on the viral envelope that affects the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, thus compromising the efficiency of virus-cell fusion and preventing viral entry.","['Due', 'to', 'their_selective_action', 'on', 'enveloped_viruses', 'and', 'to', 'their_lipid_oxidation_ability', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'a_mechanism', 'on', 'the_viral_envelope', 'that', 'affects', 'the_fluidity', 'of', 'the_lipid_bilayer', ',', 'thus', 'compromising', 'the_efficiency', 'of', 'virus-cell_fusion', 'and', 'preventing', 'viral_entry', '.']","Due to their_selective_action on enveloped_viruses and to their_lipid_oxidation_ability , we hypothesize a_mechanism on the_viral_envelope that affects the_fluidity of the_lipid_bilayer , thus compromising the_efficiency of virus-cell_fusion and preventing viral_entry .","['enveloped_viruses', 'a_mechanism', 'the_viral_envelope', 'the_fluidity', 'the_lipid_bilayer', 'the_efficiency', 'virus-cell_fusion', 'viral_entry']"
"An epizootic of feline infectious peritonitis in a captive cheetah population during 1982–1983 served to focus attention on the susceptibility of the cheetah (Acinoyx jubatus) to infectious disease. Subsequent observations based upon seroepidemiological surveys and electron microscopy of fecal material verified that cheetahs were indeed capable of being infected by coronaviruses, which were antigenically related to coronaviruses affecting domestic cats, i.e. feline infectious peritonitis virus/feline enteric coronavirus. Coincident with the apparent increased susceptibility of the cheetah to infectious diseases, were observations that the cheetah was genetically unusual insofar as large amounts of enzyme-encoding loci were monomorphic, and that unrelated cheetahs were capable of accepting allogenic skin grafts. These data provided the basis for a hypothesis that the cheetah, through intensive inbreeding, had become more susceptible to viral infections as a result of genetic homogeneity.","These data provided the basis for a hypothesis that the cheetah, through intensive inbreeding, had become more susceptible to viral infections as a result of genetic homogeneity.","['These_data', 'provided', 'the_basis', 'for', 'a_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_cheetah', ',', 'through', 'intensive_inbreeding', ',', 'had', 'become', 'more', 'susceptible', 'to', 'viral_infections', 'as', 'a_result', 'of', 'genetic_homogeneity', '.']","These_data provided the_basis for a_hypothesis that the_cheetah , through intensive_inbreeding , had become more susceptible to viral_infections as a_result of genetic_homogeneity .","['These_data', 'the_basis', 'a_hypothesis', 'the_cheetah', 'intensive_inbreeding', 'viral_infections', 'a_result', 'genetic_homogeneity']"
"One of the main goals of community ecology is to measure the relative importance of environmental filters to understand patterns of species distribution at different temporal and spatial scales. Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

"BACKGROUND: Despite the significant interest in β(2)-Adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) polymorphisms related to asthma, whether ADRB2 genetic variants are similarly associated with acute respiratory tract infections have not been studied. We hypothesized that genetic variants in ADRB2 associated with a response to asthma therapy during an asthma exacerbation were also associated with severity of acute respiratory tract infections. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 5 common polymorphisms in the promoter region and coding block of the ADRB2 gene (loci -2387, -2274, -1343, +46, and +79) from 374 Caucasian and African American term infants who were enrolled at the time of acute respiratory illness over four respiratory viral seasons. Severity of respiratory tract infections was measured using a bronchiolitis severity score (BSS; range = 0-12, clinically significant difference = 0.5) with a higher score indicating more severe disease. We assigned the promoter, coding and combined promoter and coding haplotypes to the unphased genotype data. The associations between each of these five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as the haplotypes and infant BSS were analyzed using nonparametric univariate analysis and multivariable proportional odds model separately in Caucasians and African Americans. RESULTS: There was no significant association between infant BSS and each of the SNPs in both Caucasians and African Americans. However, promoter haplotype CCA was associated with a decreased BSS in African Americans in a dose dependent manner. The median (interquartile range) BSS of infants with no copies of the CCA haplotype, one copy, and two copies of the CCA haplotype were 5.5 (2.0, 8.0), 4.0 (1.0, 7.5), and 3.0 (1.0, 4.0), respectively. This dose dependent relationship persisted after adjusting for infant age, gender, daycare exposure, secondhand smoke exposure, prior history of breastfeeding, siblings at home, and enrollment season (adjusted odds ratio: 0.59, 95 % confidence interval: 0.36, 0.98). There was no similar protective relationship of haplotype CCA on severity of respiratory tract infections identified in Caucasians. CONCLUSIONS: ADRB2 genotype may be predictive of severity of acute respiratory tract infections in African Americans, and potentially identify a subset of infants who may respond to beta-agonist therapy.

"BACKGROUND: Molecular assays targeted to nucleic acid (NA) markers are becoming increasingly important to medical diagnostics. However, these are typically confined to wealthy, developed countries; or, to the national reference laboratories of developing-world countries. There are many infectious diseases that are endemic in low-resource settings (LRS) where the lack of simple, instrument-free, NA diagnostic tests is a critical barrier to timely treatment. One of the primary barriers to the practicality and availability of NA assays in LRS has been the complexity and power requirements of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation (another is sample preparation). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays. We assess the heater's equivalence to commercially available PCR instruments through the characterization of the temperature profiles produced, and a minimal method comparison. Versions of the prototype for several different isothermal techniques are presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays, and that the results of those assays are not significantly different from ones incubated in parallel in commercially available PCR instruments. These results clearly suggest the potential of the non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification (NINA) heater for molecular diagnostics in LRS. When combined with other innovations in development that eliminate power requirements for sample preparation, cold reagent storage, and readout, the NINA heater will comprise part of a kit that should enable electricity-free NA testing for many important analytes.","In this article, we investigate the hypothesis that an electricity-free heater based on exothermic chemical reactions and engineered phase change materials can successfully incubate isothermal NA amplification assays.","['In', 'this_article', ',', 'we', 'investigate', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'an_electricity-free_heater', 'based', 'on', 'exothermic_chemical_reactions', 'and', 'engineered_phase_change_materials', 'can', 'successfully', 'incubate', 'isothermal_NA_amplification', 'assays', '.']","In this_article , we investigate the_hypothesis that an_electricity-free_heater based on exothermic_chemical_reactions and engineered_phase_change_materials can successfully incubate isothermal_NA_amplification assays .","['this_article', 'the_hypothesis', 'an_electricity-free_heater', 'exothermic_chemical_reactions', 'engineered_phase_change_materials', 'isothermal_NA_amplification assays']"

This vertical transmission was studied with 159 samples from mother-child couples: maternal vaginal (MV) and respiratory (MR) samples during labor; and newborn gastric sample (NG) with detection of HCoV (229E, OC-43, NL-63, HKU1) via real time RT PCR. HCoV was detected in 12 samples (229E: 11; HKU1: 1) from seven mother-child couples. For three couples, only MR tested positive (cases 1–3). For two other couples all three samples (MV, MR and NG) tested positive (cases 4 and 5). For case 6, only MV and NG tested positive. In case 7, only MV was positive.

"Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors promote long-term gene transfer in many animal species. Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6-vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6-vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.",We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'immaturity', 'of', 'the_immune_system', 'would', 'permit', 'induction', 'of', 'tolerance', 'to', 'rAAV6', 'when', 'delivered', 'during', 'the_neonatal_period', '.']",We hypothesized that immaturity of the_immune_system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the_neonatal_period .,"['immaturity', 'the_immune_system', 'induction', 'tolerance', 'rAAV6']"
"NTP-motif, a consensus sequence previously shown to be characteristic of numerous NTP-utilizing enzymes, was identified in nonstructural proteins of several groups of positive-strand RNA viruses. These groups include picorna-, alpha-, and coronaviruses infecting animals and como-, poty-, tobamo-, tricorna-, hordei-, and furoviruses of plants, totalling 21 viruses. It has been demonstrated that the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins constitute three distinct families, the sequences within each family being similar to each other at a statistically highly significant level. A lower, but still valid similarity has also been revealed between the families. An overall alignment has been generated, which includes several highly conserved sequence stretches. The two most prominent of the latter contain the socalled “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif, with four of the five invariant amino acid residues observed within these sequences. These observations, taken together with the results of comparative analysis of the positions occupied by respective proteins (domains) in viral multidomain proteins, suggest that all the NTP-motif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses are homologous, constituting a highly diverged monophyletic group. In this group the “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif are the most conserved sequences and, by inference, should play the principal role in the functioning of the proteins. A hypothesis is proposed that all these proteins posses NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, performing some NTP-dependent function in viral RNA replication. The importance of phylogenetic analysis for the assessment of the significance of the occurrence of the NTP-motif (and of sequence motifs of this sort in general) in proteins is emphasized.","A hypothesis is proposed that all these proteins posses NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, performing some NTP-dependent function in viral RNA replication.","['A_hypothesis', 'is', 'proposed', 'that', 'all_these_proteins', 'posses', 'NTP-binding_capacity', 'and', 'possibly_NTPase_activity', ',', 'performing', 'some_NTP-dependent_function', 'in', 'viral_RNA_replication', '.']","A_hypothesis is proposed that all_these_proteins posses NTP-binding_capacity and possibly_NTPase_activity , performing some_NTP-dependent_function in viral_RNA_replication .","['A_hypothesis', 'all_these_proteins', 'NTP-binding_capacity', 'possibly_NTPase_activity', 'some_NTP-dependent_function', 'viral_RNA_replication']"
"Abstract Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent an accessible tissue source for gene expression profiling in schizophrenia that could provide insight into the molecular basis of the disorder. This study used the Illumina HT_12 microarray platform and quantitative real time PCR (QPCR) to perform mRNA expression profiling on 114 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 80 non-psychiatric controls from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank (ASRB). Differential expression analysis revealed altered expression of 164 genes (59 up-regulated and 105 down-regulated) in the PBMCs from patients with schizophrenia compared to controls. Bioinformatic analysis indicated significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes known to be involved or associated with immune function and regulating the immune response. The differential expression of 6 genes, EIF2C2 (Ago 2), MEF2D, EVL, PI3, S100A12 and DEFA4 was confirmed by QPCR. Genome-wide expression analysis of PBMCs from individuals with schizophrenia was characterized by the alteration of genes with immune system function, supporting the hypothesis that the disorder has a significant immunological component in its etiology.","Genome-wide expression analysis of PBMCs from individuals with schizophrenia was characterized by the alteration of genes with immune system function, supporting the hypothesis that the disorder has a significant immunological component in its etiology.","['Genome-wide_expression_analysis', 'of', 'PBMCs', 'from', 'individuals', 'with', 'schizophrenia', 'was', 'characterized', 'by', 'the_alteration', 'of', 'genes', 'with', 'immune_system_function', ',', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_disorder', 'has', 'a_significant_immunological_component', 'in', 'its_etiology', '.']","Genome-wide_expression_analysis of PBMCs from individuals with schizophrenia was characterized by the_alteration of genes with immune_system_function , supporting the_hypothesis that the_disorder has a_significant_immunological_component in its_etiology .","['Genome-wide_expression_analysis', 'PBMCs', 'individuals', 'schizophrenia', 'the_alteration', 'genes', 'immune_system_function', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_disorder', 'a_significant_immunological_component', 'its_etiology']"
"The successful replication of a viral agent in a host is a complex process that often leads to a species specificity of the virus and can make interspecies transmission difficult. Despite this difficulty, natural host switch seems to have been frequent among viruses of lower vertebrates, especially fish viruses, since there are several viruses known to be able to infect a wide range of species. In the present review we will focus on well documented reports of broad host range, variations in host specificity, and host shift events hypothesized for viruses within the genera Ranavirus, Novirhabdovirus, Betanodavirus, Isavirus, and some herpesvirus.","In the present review we will focus on well documented reports of broad host range, variations in host specificity, and host shift events hypothesized for viruses within the genera Ranavirus, Novirhabdovirus, Betanodavirus, Isavirus, and some herpesvirus.","['In', 'the_present_review', 'we', 'will', 'focus', 'on', 'well_documented_reports', 'of', 'broad_host_range', ',', 'variations', 'in', 'host_specificity', ',', 'and', 'host_shift_events', 'hypothesized', 'for', 'viruses', 'within', 'the_genera_Ranavirus', ',', 'Novirhabdovirus', ',', 'Betanodavirus', ',', 'Isavirus', ',', 'and', 'some_herpesvirus', '.']","In the_present_review we will focus on well_documented_reports of broad_host_range , variations in host_specificity , and host_shift_events hypothesized for viruses within the_genera_Ranavirus , Novirhabdovirus , Betanodavirus , Isavirus , and some_herpesvirus .","['the_present_review', 'well_documented_reports', 'broad_host_range , variations', 'host_specificity', 'host_shift_events', 'viruses', 'the_genera_Ranavirus', 'Novirhabdovirus', 'Betanodavirus', 'Isavirus', 'some_herpesvirus']"
"BACKGROUND: People 65 years or older are at greater risk of serious complications from the seasonal influenza compared with young. To promote elderly people’s behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention, the aim of the current project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based low-administration-cost intervention building on a leading psychological theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). METHODS: The target group is Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or older who rarely or never adopt any preventive actions. This project will be conducted in three phases over 24 months. In phase 1, intervention program will be developed building on the HAPA theoretical framework which comprises both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors. In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation + behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable. Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model. DISCUSSION: The proposed project is expected to design theory-based intervention materials to promote the influenza prevention behaviors in Hong Kong elderly people and provide information on its effectiveness and the potential changing mechanism of behavior initiation and maintenance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This randomized controlled trial was funded by the Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF), Food and Health Bureau of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Ref: 16151222) and was registered on 13/10/2017 at CCRB Clinical Trials Registry of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a Partner Registry of a WHO Primary Registry (Ref: CUHK_CCRB00567).",Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model.,"['Structural_equation_modelling', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesized_theoretical_sequence', 'in', 'the_HAPA_model', '.']",Structural_equation_modelling will be used to test the_hypothesized_theoretical_sequence in the_HAPA_model .,"['Structural_equation_modelling', 'the_hypothesized_theoretical_sequence', 'the_HAPA_model']"
"Abstract There are many peptides known that inhibit the entry of enveloped viruses into cells, including one peptide that is successfully being used in the clinic as a drug. In this review, we discuss the discovery, antiviral activity and mechanism of action of such peptides. While peptide entry inhibitors have been discovered by a wide variety of approaches (structure-based, accidental, intentional, rational and brute force) we show here that they share a common physical chemical property: they are at least somewhat hydrophobic and/or amphipathic and have a propensity to interact with membrane interfaces. We propose that this propensity drives a shared mechanism of action for many peptide entry inhibitors, involving direct interactions with viral and cellular membranes, as well as interactions with the complex hydrophobic protein/lipid interfaces that are exposed, at least transiently, during virus–cell fusion. By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes. Based on this idea, we propose that an approach that focuses on the interfacial hydrophobicity of putative entry inhibitors could lead to the efficient discovery of novel, broad-spectrum viral entry inhibitors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Interfacially Active Peptides and Proteins. Guest Editors: William C. Wimley and Kalina Hristova.","By interacting simultaneously with the membrane interfaces and other critical hydrophobic surfaces, we hypothesize that peptide entry inhibitors can act by changing the physical chemistry of the membranes, and the fusion protein interfaces bridging them, and by doing so interfere with the fusion of cellular and viral membranes.","['By', 'interacting', 'simultaneously', 'with', 'the_membrane_interfaces', 'and', 'other_critical_hydrophobic_surfaces', ',', 'we', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'peptide_entry_inhibitors', 'can', 'act', 'by', 'changing', 'the_physical_chemistry', 'of', 'the_membranes', ',', 'and', 'the_fusion_protein', 'interfaces', 'bridging', 'them', ',', 'and', 'by', 'doing', 'so', 'interfere', 'with', 'the_fusion', 'of', 'cellular_and_viral_membranes', '.']","By interacting simultaneously with the_membrane_interfaces and other_critical_hydrophobic_surfaces , we hypothesize that peptide_entry_inhibitors can act by changing the_physical_chemistry of the_membranes , and the_fusion_protein interfaces bridging them , and by doing so interfere with the_fusion of cellular_and_viral_membranes .","['the_membrane_interfaces', 'other_critical_hydrophobic_surfaces', 'peptide_entry_inhibitors', 'the_physical_chemistry', 'the_membranes', 'the_fusion_protein interfaces', 'the_fusion', 'cellular_and_viral_membranes']"
"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 and is still causing cases and outbreaks in the Middle East. When MERS-CoV was first identified, the closest related virus was in bats; however, it has since been recognized that dromedary camels serve as a virus reservoir and potential source for human infections. A total of 376 camels were screened for MERS-Cov at a live animal market in the Eastern Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, UAE. In all, 109 MERS-CoV-positive camels were detected in week 1, and a subset of positive camels were sampled again weeks 3 through 6. A total of 126 full and 3 nearly full genomes were obtained from 139 samples. Spike gene sequences were obtained from 5 of the 10 remaining samples. The camel MERS-CoV genomes from this study represent 3 known and 2 potentially new lineages within clade B. Within lineages, diversity of camel and human MERS-CoV sequences are intermixed. We identified sequences from market camels nearly identical to the previously reported 2015 German case who visited the market during his incubation period. We described 10 recombination events in the camel samples. The most frequent recombination breakpoint was the junctions between ORF1b and S. Evidence suggests MERS-CoV infection in humans results from continued introductions of distinct MERS-CoV lineages from camels. This hypothesis is supported by the camel MERS-CoV genomes sequenced in this study.

"Mapuera virus (MPRV) was isolated from a fruit bat in Brazil in 1979, but its host range and disease-causing potential are unknown. Porcine rubulavirus (PoRV) was identified as the aetiological agent of disease outbreaks in pigs in Mexico during early 1980s, but the origin of PoRV remains elusive. In this study, the completed genome sequence of MPRV was determined, and the complete genome sequence of PoRV was assembled from previously published protein-coding genes and the non-coding genome regions determined from this study. Comparison of sequence and genome organization indicated that PoRV is more closely related to MPRV than to any other members of the genus Rubulavirus. In the P gene coding region of both viruses, there is an ORF located at the 5′ end of the P gene overlapping with the P protein coding region, similar to the C protein ORF present in most viruses of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, but absent in other known rubulaviruses. Based on these findings, we hypothesise that PoRV may also originate from bats, and spillover events from bats to pigs, either directly or via an intermediate host, were responsible for the sporadic disease outbreaks observed in Mexico.","Based on these findings, we hypothesise that PoRV may also originate from bats, and spillover events from bats to pigs, either directly or via an intermediate host, were responsible for the sporadic disease outbreaks observed in Mexico.","['Based', 'on', 'these_findings', ',', 'we', 'hypothesise', 'that', 'PoRV', 'may', 'also', 'originate', 'from', 'bats', ',', 'and', 'spillover', 'events', 'from', 'bats', 'to', 'pigs', ',', 'either', 'directly', 'or', 'via', 'an_intermediate_host', ',', 'were', 'responsible', 'for', 'the_sporadic_disease_outbreaks', 'observed', 'in', 'Mexico', '.']","Based on these_findings , we hypothesise that PoRV may also originate from bats , and spillover events from bats to pigs , either directly or via an_intermediate_host , were responsible for the_sporadic_disease_outbreaks observed in Mexico .","['these_findings', 'PoRV', 'bats', 'spillover', 'events', 'bats', 'pigs', 'the_sporadic_disease_outbreaks', 'Mexico']"
"A large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been detected in horseshoe bats since 2005 in different areas of China. However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show sequence differences from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in different genes (S, ORF8, ORF3, etc) and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Herein, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveals that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. In addition, we report the first discovery of bat SARSr-CoVs highly similar to human SARS-CoV in ORF3b and in the split ORF8a and 8b. Moreover, SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared with those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.",We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_direct_progenitor', 'of', 'SARS-CoV', 'may', 'have', 'originated', 'after', 'sequential_recombination_events', 'between', 'the_precursors', 'of', 'these_SARSr-CoVs', '.']",We hypothesize that the_direct_progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential_recombination_events between the_precursors of these_SARSr-CoVs .,"['the_direct_progenitor', 'SARS-CoV', 'sequential_recombination_events', 'the_precursors', 'these_SARSr-CoVs']"
"RATIONALE: Emphysema and osteoporosis are epidemiologically associated diseases of cigarette smokers. The causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders. OBJECTIVES: To discover an antigen-specific autoimmune response associated with both emphysema and osteoporosis among smokers. METHODS: Replicate nonbiased discovery assays indicated that autoimmunity to glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and cell surface signaling receptor, is present in many smokers. Subject assessments included spirometry, chest CT scans, dual x-ray absorptiometry, and immunoblots for anti-GRP78 IgG. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were isolated from patient plasma by affinity chromatography, leukocyte functions assessed by flow cytometry, and soluble metabolites and mediators measured by immunoassays. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Circulating anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies were detected in plasma specimens from 86 (32%) of the 265 smoking subjects. Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were singularly prevalent among subjects with radiographic emphysema (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7–5.7, p = 0.003). Anti-GRP78 autoantibodies were also associated with osteoporosis (OR 4.7, 95%CI 1.7–13.3, p = 0.002), and increased circulating bone metabolites (p = 0.006). Among emphysematous subjects, GRP78 protein was an autoantigen of CD4 T-cells, stimulating lymphocyte proliferation (p = 0.0002) and IFN-gamma production (p = 0.03). Patient-derived anti-GRP78 autoantibodies had avidities for osteoclasts and macrophages, and increased macrophage NFkB phosphorylation (p = 0.005) and productions of IL-8, CCL-2, and MMP9 (p = 0.005, 0.007, 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Humoral and cellular GRP78 autoimmune responses in smokers have numerous biologically-relevant pro-inflammatory and other deleterious actions, and are associated with emphysema and osteoporosis. These findings may have relevance for the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases, and development of biomarker immunoassays and/or novel treatments for these disorders.",We hypothesized autoimmune responses may be involved in both disorders.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'autoimmune_responses', 'may', 'be', 'involved', 'in', 'both_disorders', '.']",We hypothesized autoimmune_responses may be involved in both_disorders .,"['autoimmune_responses', 'both_disorders']"
"BACKGROUND: The required efforts, feasibility and predicted success of an intervention strategy against an infectious disease are partially determined by its basic reproduction number, R(0). In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector’s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease’s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.",We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates.,"['We', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'some', 'of', 'the_assumptions', 'underlying', 'these_models', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'unrealistic', 'high', 'vector', 'life', 'expectancies', 'with', 'important_repercussions', 'for', 'R(0)_estimates', '.']",We hypothesised that some of the_assumptions underlying these_models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important_repercussions for R(0)_estimates .,"['the_assumptions', 'underlying these_models', 'vector', 'life', 'important_repercussions', 'R(0)_estimates']"
"BACKGROUND: The impact of different classes of microbial pathogens on mortality in severe community-acquired pneumonia is not well elucidated. Previous studies have shown significant variation in the incidence of viral, bacterial and mixed infections, with conflicting risk associations for mortality. We aimed to determine the risk association of microbial aetiologies with hospital mortality in severe CAP, utilising a diagnostic strategy incorporating molecular testing. Our primary hypothesis was that respiratory viruses were important causative pathogens in severe CAP and was associated with increased mortality when present with bacterial pathogens in mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2014 to July 2015 was conducted in a tertiary hospital medical intensive care unit in eastern Singapore, which has a tropical climate. All patients diagnosed with severe community-acquired pneumonia were included. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were in the study. Microbial pathogens were identified in 84 (71.8%) patients. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections occurred in 18 (15.4%) of patients. Isolated viral infections were present in 32 patients (27.4%); isolated bacterial infections were detected in 34 patients (29.1%). Hospital mortality occurred in 16 (13.7%) patients. The most common bacteria isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae and the most common virus isolated was Influenza A. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression showed that serum procalcitonin, APACHE II severity score and mixed viral-bacterial infection were associated with increased risk of hospital mortality. Mixed viral-bacterial co-infections were associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% CI 1.30–151.05, p = 0.03) for hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are common organisms isolated in severe community-acquired pneumonia.

"BACKGROUND: Concurrent infection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is known as one of the major causes for porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV is consistently to have more severe clinical presentations and pulmonary lesions than infection with PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. However, it is not known if dual infections with PCV2 and PRRSV in different infection order may lead to different clinical symptoms in the host. To mimic the possible field conditions, swine alveolar macrophages (AMs) were inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV in vitro simultaneously or with one virus 18 h earlier than the other. The cell viability, cytopathic effects, antigen-containing rates, phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities, cytokine profiles (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-α) and FasL transcripts were determined, analyzed, and compared to prove the hypothesis. RESULTS: A marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-α expression level was revealed in AMs inoculated with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously and in AMs inoculated with PCV2 first then PRRSV 18 h later, but not in AMs inoculated with PRRSV first then PCV2 18 h later. Transient decrease in phagocytosis but constant reduction in microbicidal capability in AMs in the group inoculated with PCV2 alone and constant decrease in phagocytosis and microbicidal capability in AMs in all PRRSV-inoculated groups were noted. The levels of IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-α, and FasL transcripts in AMs in all groups with dual inoculation of PCV2 and PRRSV were significantly increased regardless of the infection orders as compared with infection by PCV2 alone or PRRSV alone. CONCLUSIONS: Swine AMs infected with PCV2 first then PRRSV later or infected with PCV2 and PRRSV simultaneously displayed marked reduction in PRRSV antigen-containing rate, cytopathic effect, and TNF-α expression level. The different inoculation orders of PCV2 and PRRSV in AMs leading to different results in viral antigen positivity, cytopathology, and cytokine profile may explain, at least partially, the underlying mechanism of the enhanced pulmonary lesions in PRDC exerted by dual infection with PCV2 and PRRSV and the variable clinical manifestations of PRDC-affected pigs in the field.","The cell viability, cytopathic effects, antigen-containing rates, phagocytotic and microbial killing capabilities, cytokine profiles (IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-α) and FasL transcripts were determined, analyzed, and compared to prove the hypothesis.","['The_cell_viability', ',', 'cytopathic_effects', ',', 'antigen-containing_rates', ',', 'phagocytotic_and_microbial_killing_capabilities', ',', 'cytokine_profiles', '(', 'IL-8', ',_TNF-α', ',', 'and', 'IFN-α', ')', 'and', 'FasL_transcripts', 'were', 'determined', ',', 'analyzed', ',', 'and', 'compared', 'to', 'prove', 'the_hypothesis', '.']","The_cell_viability , cytopathic_effects , antigen-containing_rates , phagocytotic_and_microbial_killing_capabilities , cytokine_profiles ( IL-8 ,_TNF-α , and IFN-α ) and FasL_transcripts were determined , analyzed , and compared to prove the_hypothesis .","['The_cell_viability', 'cytopathic_effects', 'antigen-containing_rates', 'phagocytotic_and_microbial_killing_capabilities', 'cytokine_profiles', '_', 'TNF-α', 'IFN-α', 'FasL_transcripts', 'the_hypothesis']"

We found that CVB3 infected IFN-β reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-β responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering. CVB3 infection studies with primary human hepatocytes, in which either the IFN-I or the IFN-III axis was inhibited, also indicated that primarily IFNAR-, and to a lesser extent IFNLR-triggering was needed for ISG induction. Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.","['These_data', 'are', 'compatible', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'during', 'CVB3_infection_hepatocytes', 'serve', 'as', 'important_IFN-I_producers', 'and', 'sensors', 'not', 'only', 'in', 'the_murine', ',', 'but', 'also', 'in', 'the_human_system', '.']","These_data are compatible with the_hypothesis that during CVB3_infection_hepatocytes serve as important_IFN-I_producers and sensors not only in the_murine , but also in the_human_system .","['These_data', 'the_hypothesis', 'CVB3_infection_hepatocytes', 'important_IFN-I_producers', 'sensors', 'the_murine', 'the_human_system']"
"Historic and contemporary host ecology and evolutionary dynamics have profound impacts on viral diversity, virulence, and associated disease emergence. Bats have been recognized as reservoirs for several emerging viral pathogens, and are unique among mammals in their vagility, potential for long-distance dispersal, and often very large, colonial populations. We investigate the relative influences of host ecology and population genetic structure for predictions of viral richness in relevant reservoir species. We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats. We analyze host traits and viral richness in a generalized linear regression model framework, and include a correction for sampling effort and phylogeny. We find evidence that sampling effort, IUCN status, and population genetic structure correlate with observed viral species richness in bats, and that these associations are independent of phylogeny. This study is an important first step in understanding the mechanisms that promote viral richness in reservoir species, and may aid in predicting the emergence of viral zoonoses from bats.","We test the hypothesis that host geographic range area, distribution, population genetic structure, migratory behavior, International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) threat status, body mass, and colony size, are associated with known viral richness in bats.","['We', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'host', 'geographic_range_area', ',', 'distribution', ',', 'population_genetic_structure', ',', 'migratory_behavior', ',', 'International_Union', 'for', 'Conservation', 'of', 'Nature', 'and', 'Natural_Resources', '(IUCN', ')', 'threat', 'status', ',', 'body_mass', ',', 'and', 'colony_size', ',', 'are', 'associated', 'with', 'known_viral_richness', 'in', 'bats', '.']","We test the_hypothesis that host geographic_range_area , distribution , population_genetic_structure , migratory_behavior , International_Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural_Resources (IUCN ) threat status , body_mass , and colony_size , are associated with known_viral_richness in bats .","['the_hypothesis', 'host geographic_range_area', 'distribution', 'population_genetic_structure', 'migratory_behavior', 'International_Union', 'Conservation', 'Nature', 'Natural_Resources', '(IUCN ) threat status', 'body_mass', 'colony_size', 'known_viral_richness', 'bats']"
"Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children less than 5 years old worldwide. A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia: although viruses are the most common etiologic agent, the severity of clinical symptoms associated with bacterial pneumonia and increasing antibiotic resistance makes bacterial pneumonia a major public health concern. Bacterial pneumonia can follow upper respiratory viral infection and complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of influenza-related deaths. In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions. We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT. However, it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in pneumonia etiology. The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co-infection, increased carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia has been established.","In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i)","['In', 'this_review', ',', 'we', 'evaluate', 'the_following_hypotheses', ':', '(', 'i', ')']","In this_review , we evaluate the_following_hypotheses : ( i )","['this_review', 'the_following_hypotheses', '( i']"
"In a screen for RNA mutagen resistance, we isolated a high fidelity RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) variant of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). Curiously, this variant A372V is also resistant to amiloride. We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity. Indeed, amiloride compounds increase the mutation frequencies of CVB3 and poliovirus and high fidelity variants of both viruses are more resistant to this effect. We hypothesize that this mutagenic activity is mediated through alterations in intracellular ions such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+), which in turn increase virus mutation frequency by affecting RdRp fidelity. Furthermore, we show that another amiloride-resistant RdRp variant, S299T, is completely resistant to this mutagenic activity and unaffected by changes in ion concentrations. We show that RdRp variants resist the mutagenic activity of amiloride via two different mechanisms: 1) increased fidelity that generates virus populations presenting lower basal mutation frequencies or 2) resisting changes in divalent cation concentrations that affect polymerase fidelity. Our results uncover a new antiviral approach based on mutagenesis.",We hypothesize that amiloride has a previously undescribed mutagenic activity.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'amiloride', 'has', 'a_previously_undescribed_mutagenic_activity', '.']",We hypothesize that amiloride has a_previously_undescribed_mutagenic_activity .,"['amiloride', 'a_previously_undescribed_mutagenic_activity']"
"In this paper, the propagation of a nonlinear delay SIR epidemic using the double epidemic hypothesis is modeled. In the model, a system of impulsive functional differential equations is studied and the sufficient conditions for the global attractivity of the semi-trivial periodic solution are drawn. By use of new computational techniques for impulsive differential equations with delay, we prove that the system is permanent under appropriate conditions. The results show that time delay, pulse vaccination, and nonlinear incidence have significant effects on the dynamics behaviors of the model.

"OBJECTIVE: Heterotaxy (HTX) congenital heart disease (CHD) patients with ciliary dysfunction (CD) have been shown to have increased postoperative respiratory morbidity. We hypothesized that non-HTX CHD infants with CD will also have increased postoperative morbidity, particularly respiratory complications. METHODS: Sixty-three infants with non-HTX CHD undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled. Tests commonly used to assess for CD, nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurements and nasal epithelial ciliary motion (CM) assessment, were obtained. Baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Non-HTX CHD infants exhibited a high prevalence of abnormal CM (32%) and low nNO (39%). This was not correlated with demographics or surgical complexity. Infants with abnormal CM had increased odds of requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (OR 6.5, CI 1.5–29.4, P = 0.016) and respiratory medication use (OR 4.4, CI 1.5–13.3, P = 0.01). In contrast, infants with low nNO showed evidence of abnormal pre- and postoperative systolic function (40% vs. 4%; P = 0.004, and 34% vs. 13%; P = 0.056, respectively) and had higher odds of acquiring infections (OR 4.9, CI 1.4–17, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Non-HTX CHD infants with abnormal CM showed increased postoperative morbidity associated with poor respiratory outcomes. In contrast, low nNO correlated with reduced hemodynamic function. These findings suggest screening for abnormal CM may allow perioperative interventions to reduce pulmonary morbidities. Whether low nNO may prognosticate poor hemodynamic function warrants further investigation.","We hypothesized that non-HTX CHD infants with CD will also have increased postoperative morbidity, particularly respiratory complications.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that_non-HTX_CHD_infants', 'with', 'CD', 'will', 'also', 'have', 'increased', 'postoperative_morbidity', ',', 'particularly_respiratory_complications', '.']","We hypothesized that_non-HTX_CHD_infants with CD will also have increased postoperative_morbidity , particularly_respiratory_complications .","['that_non-HTX_CHD_infants', 'CD', 'postoperative_morbidity', 'particularly_respiratory_complications']"
"Noroviruses are the principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide with GII.4 strains accounting for 80% of infections. The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic potentials. To test if antigenic drift may contribute to GII.4 persistence, human memory B cells were immortalized and the resulting human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) characterized for reactivity to a panel of time-ordered GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs). Reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns; ancestral (1987–1997), contemporary (2004–2009), and broad (1987–2009). NVB 114 reacted exclusively to the earliest GII.4 VLPs by EIA and blockade. NVB 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary GII.4 VLPs, while NBV 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the GII.4.2006 Minerva strain. Three mAbs had broad GII.4 reactivity. Two, NVB 37.10 and 61.3, also detected other genogroup II VLPs by EIA but did not block any VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands. NVB 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered GII.4 VLPs, as measured by VLP-carbohydrate blockade assays. Using mutant VLPs designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes, two evolving, GII.4-specific, blockade epitopes were mapped. Amino acids 294–298 and 368–372 were required for binding NVB 114, 111 and 43.9 mAbs. Amino acids 393–395 were essential for binding NVB 97, supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation. These data inform VLP vaccine design, provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines, and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","['Moreover', ',', 'these_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'GII.4_norovirus_evolution', 'is', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'by', 'antigenic_variation', 'of', 'neutralizing_epitopes', 'and', 'consequently', ',', 'antibody', '-', 'driven', 'receptor', 'switching', ';', 'thus', ',', 'protective_herd_immunity', 'is', 'a_driving_force', 'in', 'norovirus_molecular_evolution', '.']","Moreover , these_data support the_hypothesis that GII.4_norovirus_evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic_variation of neutralizing_epitopes and consequently , antibody - driven receptor switching ; thus , protective_herd_immunity is a_driving_force in norovirus_molecular_evolution .","['these_data', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'GII.4_norovirus_evolution', 'antigenic_variation', 'neutralizing_epitopes', 'antibody', 'receptor', 'switching', 'protective_herd_immunity', 'a_driving_force', 'norovirus_molecular_evolution']"
"BACKGROUND: Although children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) mount immune responses after vaccination with the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), these responses are lower compared to controls. Recently, a high dose (HD) TIV was found to increase the level of antibody response in elderly patients compared to the standard dose (SD) TIV. We hypothesized that the HD TIV would be well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the SD TIV in pediatric subjects with ALL. PROCEDURE: This was a randomized, double-blind, phase I safety and immunogenicity trial comparing the HD to the SD TIV in children with ALL. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive either the HD (60µg) or the SD (15µg) TIV. Local and systemic reactions were solicited, hemagglutinin inhibition titers to influenza virus antigens were measured, and monitoring labs were collected prior to and/or after each vaccination. RESULTS: Fifty subjects were enrolled (34 HD, 16 SD). Mean age was 8.5 years; 63% were male, and 80% were in maintenance therapy. There were no significant differences reported in local or systemic symptoms. No severe adverse events were attributed to vaccination. No significant differences between the HD and SD TIV groups were noted for immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: No differences were noted between the HD and SD TIV groups for solicited systemic and local reactions. Since this study was not powered for immunogenicity, a phase II trial is needed to determine the immunogenicity of HD versus SD TIV in the pediatric ALL population.",We hypothesized that the HD TIV would be well-tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the SD TIV in pediatric subjects with ALL.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_HD_TIV', 'would', 'be', 'well', '-', 'tolerated', 'and', 'more', 'immunogenic', 'compared', 'to', 'the_SD_TIV', 'in', 'pediatric_subjects', 'with', 'ALL', '.']",We hypothesized that the_HD_TIV would be well - tolerated and more immunogenic compared to the_SD_TIV in pediatric_subjects with ALL .,"['the_HD_TIV', 'pediatric_subjects']"
"Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with tremendous clinical heterogeneity and uncertain pathobiology and lacking in clinically useful biomarkers. The Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis (GRADS) study is an observational cohort study designed to explore the role of the lung microbiome and genome in these two diseases. This article describes the design and rationale for the GRADS study sarcoidosis protocol. The study addresses the hypothesis that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription. The goal is to enroll 400 participants, with a minimum of 35 in each of 9 clinical phenotype subgroups prioritized by their clinical relevance to understanding of the pathobiology and clinical heterogeneity of sarcoidosis. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis undergo a baseline visit with self-administered questionnaires, chest computed tomography, pulmonary function tests, and blood and urine testing. A research or clinical bronchoscopy with a research bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed to obtain samples for genomic and microbiome analyses. Comparisons will be made by blood genomic analysis and with clinical phenotypic variables. A 6-month follow-up visit is planned to assess each participant’s clinical course. By the use of an integrative approach to the analysis of the microbiome and genome in selected clinical phenotypes, the GRADS study is powerfully positioned to inform and direct studies on the pathobiology of sarcoidosis, identify diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers, and provide novel molecular phenotypes that could lead to improved personalized approaches to therapy for sarcoidosis.",The study addresses the hypothesis that distinct patterns in the lung microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic inflammatory responses as measured by peripheral blood changes in gene transcription.,"['The_study', 'addresses', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'distinct_patterns', 'in', 'the_lung_microbiome', 'are', 'characteristic', 'of', 'sarcoidosis_phenotypes', 'and', 'are', 'reflected', 'in', 'changes', 'in', 'systemic_inflammatory_responses', 'as', 'measured', 'by', 'peripheral_blood_changes', 'in', 'gene_transcription', '.']",The_study addresses the_hypothesis that distinct_patterns in the_lung_microbiome are characteristic of sarcoidosis_phenotypes and are reflected in changes in systemic_inflammatory_responses as measured by peripheral_blood_changes in gene_transcription .,"['The_study', 'the_hypothesis', 'distinct_patterns', 'sarcoidosis_phenotypes', 'changes', 'systemic_inflammatory_responses', 'peripheral_blood_changes', 'gene_transcription']"
"Stroke attracts neutrophils to the injured brain tissue where they can damage the integrity of the blood–brain barrier and exacerbate the lesion. However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia- and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.

"BACKGROUND: A new algorithm for assessing similarity between primer and template has been developed based on the hypothesis that annealing of primer to template is an information transfer process. RESULTS: Primer sequence is converted to a vector of the full potential hydrogen numbers (3 for G or C, 2 for A or T), while template sequence is converted to a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed after primer annealing. The former is considered as source information and the latter destination information. An information coefficient is calculated as a measure for fidelity of this information transfer process and thus a measure of similarity between primer and potential annealing site on template.

"Viral membrane fusion is an orchestrated process triggered by membrane-anchored viral fusion glycoproteins. The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) contains internal domains called fusion peptides (FP) that play essential roles in virus entry. Although membrane fusion has been broadly studied, there are still major gaps in the molecular details of lipid rearrangements in the bilayer during fusion peptide-membrane interactions. Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature. The significance of the ordering effect, membrane dehydration, changes in the curvature properties and the possible role of negatively charged phospholipids in helping to overcome the high kinetic barrier involved in the different stages of the SARS-CoV-mediated membrane fusion are discussed.",DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes.,"['DSC_data', 'showed', 'the_peptides', 'strongly', 'perturb', 'the_structural_integrity', 'of', 'anionic_vesicles', 'and', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_peptides', 'generate', 'opposing_curvature_stresses', 'on', 'phosphatidylethanolamine_membranes', '.']",DSC_data showed the_peptides strongly perturb the_structural_integrity of anionic_vesicles and support the_hypothesis that the_peptides generate opposing_curvature_stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine_membranes .,"['DSC_data', 'the_peptides', 'the_structural_integrity', 'anionic_vesicles', 'the_hypothesis', 'the_peptides', 'opposing_curvature_stresses', 'phosphatidylethanolamine_membranes']"
"Epidemiologic and cross-sectional studies suggest that early life farming and animal exposures are associated with major health benefits, influencing immune development and modifying the subsequent risk of allergic diseases, including asthma.

"Co-infection by multiple parasites is common within individuals. Interactions between co-infecting parasites include resource competition, direct competition and immune-mediated interactions and each are likely to alter the dynamics of single parasites. We posit that co-infection is a driver of variation in parasite establishment and growth, ultimately altering the production of parasite transmission stages. To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus, the respiratory bacterial pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica lux(+) or co-infected with both parasites. To follow co-infection simultaneously, self-bioluminescent bacteria were used to quantify infection in vivo and in real-time, while helminth egg production was monitored in real-time using faecal samples. Co-infection resulted in high bacterial loads early in the infection (within the first 5 days) that could cause host mortality. Co-infection also produced helminth ‘super-shedders’; individuals that chronically shed the helminth eggs in larger than average numbers. Our study shows that co-infection may be one of the underlying mechanisms for the often-observed high variance in parasite load and shedding rates, and should thus be taken into consideration for disease management and control. Further, using self-bioluminescent bacterial reporters allowed quantification of the progression of infection within the whole animal of the same individuals at a fine temporal scale (daily) and significantly reduced the number of animals used (by 85%) compared with experiments that do not use in vivo techniques. Thus, we present bioluminescent imaging as a novel, non-invasive tool offering great potential to be taken forward into other applications of infectious disease ecology.","To test this hypothesis, three different treatment groups of laboratory mice were infected with the gastrointestinal helminth","['To', 'test', 'this_hypothesis', ',', 'three_different_treatment_groups', 'of', 'laboratory_mice', 'were', 'infected', 'with', 'the_gastrointestinal_helminth']","To test this_hypothesis , three_different_treatment_groups of laboratory_mice were infected with the_gastrointestinal_helminth","['three_different_treatment_groups', 'laboratory_mice', 'the_gastrointestinal_helminth']"
"The intracellular bacterial pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis, is a tryptophan auxotroph. Therefore, induction of the host tryptophan catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxgenase-1 (IDO1), by interferon gamma (IFNγ) is one of the primary protective responses against chlamydial infection. However, despite the presence of a robust IFNγ response, active and replicating C. trachomatis can be detected in cervical secretions of women. We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFNγ response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel method to separate a pool of cells exposed to C. trachomatis into pure populations of live infected and bystander cells and applied this technique to distinguish between the effects of IFNγ on infected and bystander cells. Our findings revealed that the protective induction of IDO1 is suppressed specifically within primary infected cells because Chlamydia attenuates the nuclear import of activated STAT1 following IFNγ exposure, without affecting STAT1 levels or phosphorylation. Critically, the IFNγ-mediated induction of IDO1 activity is unhindered in bystander cells. Therefore, the IDO1-mediated tryptophan catabolism is functional in these cells, transforming these bystander cells into inhospitable hosts for a secondary C. trachomatis infection.","We hypothesized that a primary C. trachomatis infection may evade the IFNγ response, and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its activation of tryptophan catabolism in bystander cells.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'a_primary_C._trachomatis_infection', 'may', 'evade', 'the_IFNγ_response', ',', 'and', 'that', 'the', 'protective', 'effect', 'of', 'this', 'cytokine', 'results', 'from', 'its_activation', 'of', 'tryptophan_catabolism', 'in', 'bystander_cells', '.']","We hypothesized that a_primary_C._trachomatis_infection may evade the_IFNγ_response , and that the protective effect of this cytokine results from its_activation of tryptophan_catabolism in bystander_cells .","['a_primary_C._trachomatis_infection', 'the_IFNγ_response', 'the protective effect', 'cytokine', 'its_activation', 'tryptophan_catabolism', 'bystander_cells']"
"Feline bocavirus-1 (FBoV-1) was identified in cats from different households with hemorrhagic enteritis during outbreaks of an unusual clinical presentation of feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) in Thailand. Use of polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the FBoV-1 DNA in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous viremia, with the viral nucleic acid, detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), was localized in intestinal cells and vascular endothelium of intestinal mucosa and serosa, and in necrosis areas primarily in various lymph nodes while FPLV-immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral localization only in cryptal cells, neurons, and limited to leukocytes in the mesenteric lymph node. Full-length coding genome analysis of the Thai FBoV-1 strains isolated from moribund cats revealed three distinct strains with a high between-strain genetic diversity, while genetic recombination in one of the three FBoV-1 strains within the NS1 gene. This is the first report identifying natural genetic recombination of the FBoV-1 and describing the pathology and viral tropism of FBoV-1 infection in cats. Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic infection of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric infection of FBoV-1 is possible.

"Abstract Background Patients with slowly progressive idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, often deteriorate, thus suggesting that the clinical course may be unpredictable. Such episodes are termed acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The etiology of an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia is induced by respiratory viral infections. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia was tested for viral nucleic acid using polymerase chain reaction. Results Only 1 of the 14 patients with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia exhibited evidence of respiratory syncytial virus B, and 2 patients exhibited evidence of cytomegalovirus. Seven patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

"The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among the single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold-decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV). Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication and increased competitive fitness without reversion at the ExoN(-) active site. Furthermore, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to multiple nucleoside analogues, suggesting that MHV-ExoN(-) was under selection for increased replication fidelity. We subsequently identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially accounted for the reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogues. Our results suggest that increased replication fidelity is selected in ExoN(-) CoVs and that there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.",These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and indicate that multiple replicase proteins could compensate for ExoN functions during replication.,"['These_results', 'also', 'support', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'high-fidelity_replication', 'is', 'linked', 'to', 'CoV_fitness', 'and', 'indicate', 'that', 'multiple_replicase_proteins', 'could', 'compensate', 'for', 'ExoN_functions', 'during', 'replication', '.']",These_results also support the_hypothesis that high-fidelity_replication is linked to CoV_fitness and indicate that multiple_replicase_proteins could compensate for ExoN_functions during replication .,"['These_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'high-fidelity_replication', 'CoV_fitness', 'multiple_replicase_proteins', 'ExoN_functions', 'replication']"
"BACKGROUND: Phylogenetic analysis is now an important tool in the study of viral outbreaks. It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. RESULTS: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a “weight” using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.

"Pneumonitis is the leading cause of death associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the risk factors and the mechanism underlying this toxicity have not been elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells. Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-α-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α. These novel findings have significant implications in understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis and in NSCLC treatment.","Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity","['Hence', ',', 'we', 'aimed', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'EGFR', 'tyrosine_kinase_activity']","Hence , we aimed to test the_hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine_kinase_activity","['the_hypothesis', 'EGFR', 'tyrosine_kinase_activity']"
"BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has been responsible for several viral attacks in the Asian porcine industry, since the first outbreak in China in 2006. During the early stages of the HP-PRRSV infection, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines are noted in the host peripheral blood, which are accompanied by severe lesions in the lungs and immune system organs; these are considered as the greatest contributors to the overall disease burden. We hypothesized that the anti-PRRSV response in piglets might be mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which led to a decrease in the psycho-neuroendocrinological manifestation of HP-PRRSV etiology via immune response regulation. RESULTS: We investigated the regulation of the HPA axis in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets that were treated with 1 mg/kg body weight (b. w.)/day mifepristone (RU486) or 2 mg/kg b.w./day dexamethasone (DEX). Both RU486 and DEX enhanced the disease status of the piglets infected by the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain, resulting in high mortality and more severe pathological changes in the lungs. CONCLUSIONS: HP-PRRSV infection activates the HPA axis, and artificial regulation of the immune-endocrine system enhances disease severity in HP-PRRSV-infected piglets. Thus, DEX and RU486 should be avoided in the clinical treatment of HP-PRRS.

"BACKGROUND: As the deployment of electronic medical records (EMR) expands, so is the availability of long-term datasets that could serve to enhance public health surveillance. We hypothesized that EMR-based surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past. METHODS: We simulated surveillance systems aimed at discovering modeled influenza outbreaks injected into backgrounds of patients with ARI. Backgrounds of daily case counts were either synthesized or obtained by applying one of three previously validated ARI case-detection algorithms to authentic EMR entries. From the time of outbreak injection, detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection and background-only time series. The relationship between the detection delay (the time from injection to the first alarm uniquely found in the background+injection data) and the false-alarm rate (FAR) was determined by systematically varying the statistical alarm threshold. We compared this relationship for outbreak detection methods that utilized either 7 days (early aberrancy reporting system (EARS)) or 2–4 years of past data (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series modeling). RESULTS: In otherwise identical surveillance systems, SARIMA detected epidemics sooner than EARS at any FAR below 10%. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility and marginal benefits of SARIMA modeling. Under plausible real-world conditions, SARIMA could reduce detection delay by 5–16 days. It also was more sensitive at detecting the summer wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic. CONCLUSION: Time series modeling of long-term historical EMR data can reduce the time it takes to discover epidemics of ARI. Realistic surveillance simulations may prove invaluable to optimize system design and tuning.",We hypothesized that EMR-based surveillance systems that incorporate seasonality and other long-term trends would discover outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI) sooner than systems that only consider the recent past.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that_EMR-based_surveillance_systems', 'that', 'incorporate', 'seasonality', 'and', 'other_long-term_trends', 'would', 'discover', 'outbreaks', 'of', 'acute_respiratory_infections', '(', 'ARI', ')', 'sooner', 'than', 'systems', 'that', 'only', 'consider', 'the_recent_past', '.']",We hypothesized that_EMR-based_surveillance_systems that incorporate seasonality and other_long-term_trends would discover outbreaks of acute_respiratory_infections ( ARI ) sooner than systems that only consider the_recent_past .,"['that_EMR-based_surveillance_systems', 'seasonality', 'other_long-term_trends', 'outbreaks', 'acute_respiratory_infections', '( ARI', 'systems', 'the_recent_past']"
"BACKGROUND: Studies of wild animals responding to their native parasites are essential if we are to understand how the immune system functions in the natural environment. While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.","Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating.","['Here', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'wild_common_shrews', '(Sorex_araneus', ')', ',', 'which', 'produce', 'large_numbers', 'of', 'offspring', 'during', 'the_one_breeding_season', 'of', 'their_short_life_span', ',', 'forgo_investment', 'in', 'immunity_and_immune_system_maintenance', ',', 'as', 'increased_longevity', 'is', 'unlikely', 'to', 'bring', 'further_opportunities', 'for', 'mating', '.']","Here , we tested the_hypothesis that wild_common_shrews (Sorex_araneus ) , which produce large_numbers of offspring during the_one_breeding_season of their_short_life_span , forgo_investment in immunity_and_immune_system_maintenance , as increased_longevity is unlikely to bring further_opportunities for mating .","['the_hypothesis', '(Sorex_araneus', 'large_numbers', 'offspring', 'the_one_breeding_season', 'their_short_life_span', 'forgo_investment', 'immunity_and_immune_system_maintenance', 'increased_longevity', 'further_opportunities', 'mating']"

"BACKGROUND: Hantaviruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens which cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, an immune-mediated pathogenesis is discussed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TGF-β expression in acute hantavirus infection. RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β2 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30–39 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-β1 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-β2 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-β1/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: High serum CRP and low serum TGF-β in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease.

"BACKGROUND: Infectious Leptospira colonize the kidneys of reservoir (e.g. rats) and accidental hosts such as humans. The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions.","['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'Leptospira-infection', 'will', 'alter', 'the_content', 'of', 'urine_exosomes', ',', 'and', 'further', ',', 'that', 'these_Leptospira-induced_alterations', 'will', 'hold', 'clues', 'to', 'unravel', 'novel_pathways', 'related', 'to', 'bacterial-host_interactions', '.']","We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the_content of urine_exosomes , and further , that these_Leptospira-induced_alterations will hold clues to unravel novel_pathways related to bacterial-host_interactions .","['Leptospira-infection', 'the_content', 'urine_exosomes', 'these_Leptospira-induced_alterations', 'clues', 'unravel', 'novel_pathways', 'bacterial-host_interactions']"
"The porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) devastates the health of piglets but may not infect piglets whose CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) gene is mutated (knockouts, KO) by using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques. This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I, n = 6, and III, n = 15) and 3-day-old (in exp. II, n = 9) KO and wild-type (WT, same ages in respective exps.) piglets were inoculated with TCID(50) 1x10(3) PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow’s colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals either deceased or euthanized were necropsied and intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.",This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV.,"['This_hypothesis', 'was', 'tested', 'by', 'using', 'KO_piglets', 'that', 'were', 'challenged', 'with', 'PEDV', '.']",This_hypothesis was tested by using KO_piglets that were challenged with PEDV .,"['This_hypothesis', 'KO_piglets', 'PEDV']"
"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the cause of varicella (chickenpox) and zoster (shingles). Varicella is a primary infection that spreads rapidly in epidemics while zoster is a secondary infection that occurs sporadically as a result of the reactivation of previously acquired VZV. Reactivation is made possible by the establishment of latency during the initial episode of varicella. The signature lesions of both varicella and zoster are cutaneous vesicles, which are filled with a clear fluid that is rich in infectious viral particles. It has been postulated that the skin is the critical organ in which both host-to-host transmission of VZV and the infection of neurons to establish latency occur. This hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR(ci)) interacts with VZV in virtually all infected cells, except those of the suprabasal epidermis, in a way that prevents the release of infectious viral particles. Specifically, the virus is diverted in an MPR(ci)-dependent manner from the secretory pathway to late endosomes where VZV is degraded. Because nonepidermal cells are thus prevented from releasing infectious VZV, a slow process, possibly involving fusion of infected cells with their neighbors, becomes the means by which VZV is disseminated. In the epidermis, however, the maturation of keratinocytes to give rise to corneocytes in the suprabasal epidermis is associated uniquely with a downregulation of the MPR(ci). As a result, the diversion of VZV to late endosomes does not occur in the suprabasal epidermis where vesicular lesions occur. The formation of the waterproof, chemically resistant barrier of the epidermis, however, requires that constitutive secretion outlast the downregulation of the endosomal pathway. Infectious VZV is therefore secreted by default, accounting for the presence of infectious virions in vesicular fluid. Sloughing of corneocytes, aided by scratching, then aerosolizes the virus, which can float with dust to be inhaled by susceptible hosts. Infectious virions also bathe the terminals of those sensory neurons that innervate the epidermis. These terminals become infected with VZV and provide a route, retrograde transport, which can conduct VZV to cranial nerve (CNG), dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and enteric ganglia (EG) to establish latency. Reactivation returns VZV to the skin, now via anterograde transport in axons, to cause the lesions of zoster. Evidence in support of these hypotheses includes observations of the VZV-infected human epidermis and studies of guinea pig neurons in an in vitro model system.","This hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR(ci)) interacts with VZV in virtually all infected cells, except those of the suprabasal epidermis, in a way that prevents the release of infectious viral particles.","['This_hypothesis', 'is', 'built', 'on', 'evidence', 'that', 'the', 'large', 'cation', '-', 'independent', 'mannose_6-phosphate_receptor', '(', 'MPR(ci', ')', ')', 'interacts', 'with', 'VZV', 'in', 'virtually_all_infected_cells', ',', 'except', 'those', 'of', 'the_suprabasal_epidermis', ',', 'in', 'a_way', 'that', 'prevents', 'the_release', 'of', 'infectious_viral_particles', '.']","This_hypothesis is built on evidence that the large cation - independent mannose_6-phosphate_receptor ( MPR(ci ) ) interacts with VZV in virtually_all_infected_cells , except those of the_suprabasal_epidermis , in a_way that prevents the_release of infectious_viral_particles .","['This_hypothesis', 'evidence', 'the large cation - independent mannose_6-phosphate_receptor', 'MPR(ci', 'VZV', 'virtually_all_infected_cells', 'the_suprabasal_epidermis', 'a_way', 'the_release', 'infectious_viral_particles']"
"As one of the virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis, lethal toxin (LT) induces various pathogenic responses including the suppression of the coagulation system. In this study, we observed that LT markedly increased the circulating soluble P-selectin (sP-sel) levels and microparticle (MP) count in wild-type but not P-selectin (P-sel, Selp(−/−)) or P-sel ligand-1 (PSGL-1, Selplg(−/−)) knockout mice. Because sP-sel induces a hypercoagulable state through PSGL-1 pathway to generate tissue factor-positive MPs, we hypothesized that the increase in plasma sP-sel levels can be a self-rescue response in hosts against the LT-mediated suppression of the coagulation system. In agreement with our hypothesis, our results indicated that compared with wild-type mice, Selp(−/−) and Selplg(−/−) mice were more sensitive to LT. In addition, the recombinant sP-sel treatment markedly ameliorated LT-mediated pathogenesis and reduced mortality. As a result, elicitation of circulating sP-sel is potentially a self-rescue response, which is beneficial to host recovery from an LT-induced hypocoagulation state. These results suggest that the administration of sP-sel is likely to be useful in the development of a new strategy to treat anthrax.","Because sP-sel induces a hypercoagulable state through PSGL-1 pathway to generate tissue factor-positive MPs, we hypothesized that the increase in plasma sP-sel levels can be a self-rescue response in hosts against the LT-mediated suppression of the coagulation system.","['Because', 'sP-sel', 'induces', 'a_hypercoagulable_state', 'through', 'PSGL-1_pathway', 'to', 'generate', 'tissue_factor-positive_MPs', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'the_increase', 'in', 'plasma_sP-sel_levels', 'can', 'be', 'a_self-rescue_response', 'in', 'hosts', 'against', 'the_LT-mediated_suppression', 'of', 'the_coagulation_system', '.']","Because sP-sel induces a_hypercoagulable_state through PSGL-1_pathway to generate tissue_factor-positive_MPs , we hypothesized that the_increase in plasma_sP-sel_levels can be a_self-rescue_response in hosts against the_LT-mediated_suppression of the_coagulation_system .","['sP-sel', 'induces', 'PSGL-1_pathway', 'tissue_factor-positive_MPs', 'the_increase', 'plasma_sP-sel_levels', 'a_self-rescue_response', 'hosts', 'the_LT-mediated_suppression', 'the_coagulation_system']"
"BACKGROUND: Laryngoscope blades are often cleaned between cases according to well-defined protocols. However, despite evidence that laryngoscope handles could be a source of nosocomial infection, neither our institution nor the American Society of Anesthesiologists has any specific guidelines for handle disinfection. We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols. METHODS: Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination. Of these positive cultures, 25 (62.5%) yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci, seven (17.5%) Bacillus spp. not anthracis, three (7.5%) α-hemolytic Streptococcus spp., and one each (2.5%) of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Corynebacterium spp. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Gram-negative rods were detected. All viral tests were negative. CONCLUSION: We found a high incidence of bacterial contamination of laryngoscope handles despite low-level disinfection. However, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, or respiratory viruses were detected. Our results support adoption of guidelines that include, at a minimum, mandatory low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles after each patient use.",We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'laryngoscope_handles', 'may', 'be', 'sufficiently', 'contaminated', 'with', 'bacteria', 'and', 'viruses', 'to', 'justify', 'the_implementation', 'of', 'new_handle-cleaning_protocols', '.']",We hypothesized that laryngoscope_handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the_implementation of new_handle-cleaning_protocols .,"['laryngoscope_handles', 'bacteria', 'viruses', 'the_implementation', 'new_handle-cleaning_protocols']"
"A diverse subset of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detects pathogen-associated nucleic acids to initiate crucial innate immune responses in host organisms. Reflecting their importance for host defense, pathogens encode various countermeasures to evade or inhibit these immune effectors. PRRs directly engaged by pathogen inhibitors often evolve under recurrent bouts of positive selection that have been described as molecular ‘arms races.’ Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) was recently identified as a key PRR. Upon binding cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from various viruses, cGAS generates the small nucleotide secondary messenger cGAMP to signal activation of innate defenses. Here we report an evolutionary history of cGAS with recurrent positive selection in the primate lineage. Recent studies indicate a high degree of structural similarity between cGAS and 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase 1 (OAS1), a PRR that detects double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), despite low sequence identity between the respective genes. We present comprehensive comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS1 primate sequences and observe positive selection at nucleic acid binding interfaces and distributed throughout both genes. Our data revealed homologous regions with strong signatures of positive selection, suggesting common mechanisms employed by unknown pathogen encoded inhibitors and similar modes of evasion from antagonism. Our analysis of cGAS diversification also identified alternately spliced forms missing multiple sites under positive selection. Further analysis of selection on the OAS family in primates, which comprises OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL, suggests a hypothesis where gene duplications and domain fusion events result in paralogs that provide another means of escaping pathogen inhibitors. Together our comparative evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS provides new insights into distinct mechanisms by which key molecular sentinels of the innate immune system have adapted to circumvent viral-encoded inhibitors.","Further analysis of selection on the OAS family in primates, which comprises OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and OASL, suggests a hypothesis where gene duplications and domain fusion events result in paralogs that provide another means of escaping pathogen inhibitors.","['Further_analysis', 'of', 'selection', 'on', 'the_OAS_family', 'in', 'primates', ',', 'which', 'comprises', 'OAS1', ',', 'OAS2', ',', 'OAS3', 'and', 'OASL', ',', 'suggests', 'a_hypothesis', 'where', 'gene_duplications', 'and', 'domain_fusion', 'events', 'result', 'in', 'paralogs', 'that', 'provide', 'another_means', 'of', 'escaping', 'pathogen_inhibitors', '.']","Further_analysis of selection on the_OAS_family in primates , which comprises OAS1 , OAS2 , OAS3 and OASL , suggests a_hypothesis where gene_duplications and domain_fusion events result in paralogs that provide another_means of escaping pathogen_inhibitors .","['Further_analysis', 'selection', 'primates', 'OAS1', 'OAS2', 'OAS3', 'OASL', 'a_hypothesis', 'gene_duplications', 'domain_fusion', 'events', 'paralogs', 'pathogen_inhibitors']"
"BACKGROUND: Sodium channels are heteromultimeric, integral membrane proteins that belong to a superfamily of ion channels. The mutations in genes encoding for sodium channel proteins have been linked with several inherited genetic disorders such as febrile epilepsy, Brugada syndrome, ventricular fibrillation, long QT syndrome, or channelopathy associated insensitivity to pain. In spite of these significant effects that sodium channel proteins/genes could have on human health, there is no publicly available resource focused on sodium channels that would support exploration of the sodium channel related information.

"Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a negative regulator of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) through its role to degrade angiotensin II. In rats with subtotal nephrectomy (STNx), adverse cardiac remodelling occurs despite elevated cardiac ACE2 activity. We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats. STNx led to hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and increased cardiac ACE, ACE2, Ang II and Ang 1–7 levels. Cardiac gene expression of ADAM17 was also increased. In STNx, two-weeks of subcutaneous DIZE (15mg/kg/d) had no effect on blood pressure but improved diastolic dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, reduced ADAM17 mRNA and shifted the cardiac RAS balance to a cardioprotective profile with reduced ACE and Ang II. There was no change in cardiac ACE2 activity or in cardiac Ang 1–7 levels with DIZE. In conclusion, our results suggest that DIZE exerts a protective effect on the heart under the pathological condition of kidney injury. This effect was not due to improved kidney function, a fall in blood pressure or a reduction in LVH but was associated with a reduction in cardiac ACE and cardiac Ang II levels. As in vitro studies showed no direct effect of DIZE on ACE2 or ACE activity, the precise mechanism of action of DIZE remains to be determined.","We hypothesised that diminazene aceturate (DIZE), which has been described as having an off-target effect to activate ACE2, would have beneficial cardiac effects in STNx rats.","['We', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'diminazene_aceturate', '(DIZE', ')', ',', 'which', 'has', 'been', 'described', 'as', 'having', 'an_off-target_effect', 'to', 'activate', 'ACE2', ',', 'would', 'have', 'beneficial_cardiac_effects', 'in', 'STNx', 'rats', '.']","We hypothesised that diminazene_aceturate (DIZE ) , which has been described as having an_off-target_effect to activate ACE2 , would have beneficial_cardiac_effects in STNx rats .","['diminazene_aceturate (DIZE', 'ACE2', 'beneficial_cardiac_effects', 'STNx', 'rats']"
"Computational (in silico) methods have been developed and widely applied to pharmacology hypothesis development and testing. These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, similarity searching, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. Such methods have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The first part of this review discussed the methods that have been used for virtual ligand and target-based screening and profiling to predict biological activity. The aim of this second part of the review is to illustrate some of the varied applications of in silico methods for pharmacology in terms of the targets addressed. We will also discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of in silico methods with respect to in vitro and in vivo methods for pharmacology research.

"To evaluate the most controversial issue concerning current feline coronavirus (FCoV) virology, the coexisting hypotheses of the intrahost and interhost origins of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in regard to the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), this study aimed to assess the molecular diversity of the membrane gene FCoVs in 190 samples from 10 cats with signs of FIP and in 5 faecal samples from cats without signs of FIP. All samples from the non-FIP cats and 25.26% of the samples from the FIP cats were positive for the FCoV membrane (M) gene. Mutations in this gene consisted of SNP changes randomly scattered among the sequences; few mutations resulted in amino acid changes. No geographic pattern was observed. Of the cats without FIP that harboured FECoV, the amino acid sequence identities for the M gene were 100% among cats (Cats 1–3) from the same cattery, and the overall sequence identity for the M gene was ≥91%. In one cat, two different lineages of FCoV, one enteric and one systemic, were found that segregated apart in the M gene tree.

"ACE2 is a newly discovered carboxy-peptidase responsible for the formation of vasodilatory peptides such as angiotensin-(1-7). We hypothesized that ACE2 is part of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its expression regulated by the other elements of this system. ACE2 immuno-staining was performed in transgenic mouse brain sections from NSE-AT(1A) (overexpressing AT (1A) receptors), R(+)A(+) (overexpressing angiotensinogen, and renin) and control (non transgenic littermates) mice. Results show that ACE2 staining is widely distributed throughout the brain. Using cell type-specific antibodies, we observed that ACE2 staining is present in the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies but not in glial cells. In the subfornical organ, an area lacking the blood brain barrier and sensitive to blood borne angiotensin-II, ACE2 was significantly increased in transgenic mice. Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated in the nucleus of tractus solitarius/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the ventrolateral medulla, when comparing transgenic to non-transgenic mice. These results suggest that ACE2 is localized to the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in the brain, and that ACE2 levels appear highly regulated by other components of the RAS, confirming its involvement in this system. Moreover, ACE2 expression in brain structures involved in the control of cardiovascular function suggests that the carboxypeptidase may have a role in the central regulation of blood pressure and diseases involving the autonomic nervous system such as hypertension.",We hypothesized that ACE2 is part of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its expression regulated by the other elements of this system.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'ACE2', 'is', 'part', 'of', 'the_brain_renin-angiotensin_system', '(', 'RAS', ')', 'and', 'its_expression', 'regulated', 'by', 'the_other_elements', 'of', 'this_system', '.']",We hypothesized that ACE2 is part of the_brain_renin-angiotensin_system ( RAS ) and its_expression regulated by the_other_elements of this_system .,"['ACE2', 'part', 'the_brain_renin-angiotensin_system', '( RAS', 'the_other_elements', 'this_system']"
"Abstract Rabies virus (RABV) is a neurotropic virus that causes fatal disease in humans and animals. Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear. It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and into the CNS. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.","Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS.","['Furthermore', ',', 'it', 'has', 'been', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'VNAs', 'produced', 'in', 'the_CNS', 'by', 'invading', 'B_cells', ',', 'rather', 'than', 'those', 'produced', 'in', 'the_periphery', 'and', 'then', 'transported', 'into', 'the_CNS', ',', 'are', 'important', 'in', 'clearing', 'RABV', 'from', 'the_CNS', '.']","Furthermore , it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the_CNS by invading B_cells , rather than those produced in the_periphery and then transported into the_CNS , are important in clearing RABV from the_CNS .","['VNAs', 'the_CNS', 'B_cells', 'the_periphery', 'the_CNS', 'RABV', 'the_CNS']"
"BACKGROUND: The damaging effects of exposure to environmental toxicants differentially affect genetically distinct individuals, but the mechanisms contributing to these differences are poorly understood. Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene–induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a “compensation” for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1937","Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults.","['Genetic_variation', 'affects', 'the_establishment', 'of', 'the_gene_regulatory_landscape', 'and', 'thus_gene_expression', ',', 'and', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'this', 'contributes', 'to', 'the_observed_heterogeneity', 'in', 'individual_responses', 'to', 'exogenous_cellular_insults', '.']","Genetic_variation affects the_establishment of the_gene_regulatory_landscape and thus_gene_expression , and we hypothesized that this contributes to the_observed_heterogeneity in individual_responses to exogenous_cellular_insults .","['Genetic_variation', 'the_gene_regulatory_landscape', 'thus_gene_expression', 'the_observed_heterogeneity', 'individual_responses', 'exogenous_cellular_insults']"
"Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the ‘convergence model’ was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence. The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors.","['The_model', 'broadly', 'hypothesizes', 'disease_emergence', 'is', 'driven', 'by', 'the_co-incidence', 'of', 'genetic,_physical_environmental,_ecological,_and_social_factors', '.']","The_model broadly hypothesizes disease_emergence is driven by the_co-incidence of genetic,_physical_environmental,_ecological,_and_social_factors .","['The_model', 'disease_emergence', 'genetic,_physical_environmental,_ecological,_and_social_factors']"

"Previously described polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rabbit CD5, raised against expressed recombinant protein or peptides, recognize CD5 on most rabbit B cells. The mAb KEN-5 was originally reported to recognize rabbit CD5. However, KEN-5 binds almost exclusively to T cells and only to a minor population of B cells. We show here that by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), KEN-5 binds to recombinant rabbit CD5. This interaction is partially inhibited by polyclonal goat anti-CD5 antibody. In addition, immunoprecipitations from lysates of surface biotinylated rabbit lymphocytes with KEN-5 or our anti-CD5 mAb isolate molecules that migrate identically on gels with the same approximate relative molecular mass of 67,000 M(r). By flow cytometric analyses of individual cells from spleen, thymus and appendix, KEN-5 recognizes CD5-like molecules mainly on T cells and on 3-6% of IgM(+) B cells. Immunohistochemical staining of splenic and appendix tissues and confocal immunofluorescent imaging confirm and extend results from flow cytometric analyses. Quantitation of fluorescent colocalization indicates that staining by KEN-5 colocalizes with staining by anti-CD5 on small percentages lymphocytes in splenic tissue sections. As CD5 has both N- and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells. This hypothesis is supported by ELISA data that show that deglycosylation diminishes the binding of KEN-5 to recombinant rabbit CD5. Screening KEN-5 on an array with 406 glycans was inconclusive. Although we did not identify a strongly binding glycan structure, the data are suggestive that the epitope recognized by KEN-5 may be influenced by glycan structures. The epitope this mAb recognizes may either be the glycan itself, or more likely, is influenced by neighboring glycan structure. Our findings suggest that development, selection and function of different B- and T-cell subsets or their preferential survival may be directly or indirectly dependent on different glycan structures associated with CD5 or CD5-like molecules expressed on T cells compared to B cells.","As CD5 has both N- and O-linked glycosylation, we hypothesised that differential binding of KEN-5 to T cells and B-cells may be explained by different glycan structures on the CD5 present on T compared to B cells.","['As', 'CD5', 'has', 'both_N-_and_O-linked_glycosylation', ',', 'we', 'hypothesised', 'that', 'differential_binding', 'of', 'KEN-5', 'to', 'T_cells', 'and', 'B-cells', 'may', 'be', 'explained', 'by', 'different_glycan_structures', 'on', 'the_CD5', 'present', 'on', 'T', 'compared', 'to', 'B_cells', '.']","As CD5 has both_N-_and_O-linked_glycosylation , we hypothesised that differential_binding of KEN-5 to T_cells and B-cells may be explained by different_glycan_structures on the_CD5 present on T compared to B_cells .","['CD5', 'both_N-_and_O-linked_glycosylation', 'differential_binding', 'KEN-5', 'T_cells', 'B-cells', 'different_glycan_structures', 'the_CD5', 'present', 'T', 'B_cells']"
"As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history.","['Here', 'we', 'introduce', 'a_Bayesian_framework', 'for', 'inference', ',', 'visualization', 'and', 'hypothesis_testing', 'of', 'phylogeographic_history', '.']","Here we introduce a_Bayesian_framework for inference , visualization and hypothesis_testing of phylogeographic_history .","['inference', 'visualization', 'hypothesis_testing', 'phylogeographic_history']"
"The current scenario regarding the widespread Zika virus (ZIKV) has resulted in numerous diagnostic studies, specifically in South America and in locations where there is frequent entry of travelers returning from ZIKV-affected areas, including pregnant women with or without clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection. The World Health Organization, WHO, announced that millions of cases of ZIKV are likely to occur in the USA in the near future. This situation has created an alarming public health emergency of international concern requiring the detection of this life-threatening viral candidate due to increased cases of newborn microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection.

Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances. Consequently, the low and intermediate MBL levels commonly found in human populations might be the result of balancing selection. Using model infection systems with pseudotyped and authentic glycosylated viruses, we demonstrated that MBL indeed enhances infection of Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and West Nile viruses in low complement conditions. Mechanistic studies with Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein pseudotyped lentiviruses confirmed that MBL binds to N-linked glycan epitopes on viral surfaces in a specific manner via the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain, which is necessary for enhanced infection. MBL mediates lipid-raft-dependent macropinocytosis of EBOV via a pathway that appears to require less actin or early endosomal processing compared with the filovirus canonical endocytic pathway. Using a validated RNA interference screen, we identified C1QBP (gC1qR) as a candidate surface receptor that mediates MBL-dependent enhancement of EBOV infection. We also identified dectin-2 (CLEC6A) as a potentially novel candidate attachment factor for EBOV. Our findings support the concept of an innate immune haplotype that represents critical interactions between MBL and complement component C4 genes and that may modify susceptibility or resistance to certain glycosylated pathogens. Therefore, higher levels of native or exogenous MBL could be deleterious in the setting of relative hypocomplementemia which can occur genetically or because of immunodepletion during active infections. Our findings confirm our hypothesis that the pressure of infectious diseases may have contributed in part to evolutionary selection of MBL mutant haplotypes.","Since certain immune defense molecules, such as immunoglobulins, can be exploited by invasive pathogens, we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some circumstances.","['Since', 'certain_immune_defense_molecules', ',', 'such', 'as', 'immunoglobulins', ',', 'can', 'be', 'exploited', 'by', 'invasive_pathogens', ',', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'MBL', 'might', 'also', 'enhance', 'infections', 'in', 'some_circumstances', '.']","Since certain_immune_defense_molecules , such as immunoglobulins , can be exploited by invasive_pathogens , we hypothesized that MBL might also enhance infections in some_circumstances .","['certain_immune_defense_molecules', 'immunoglobulins', 'invasive_pathogens', 'MBL', 'infections', 'some_circumstances']"
"Combination antiretroviral therapy fails in complete suppression of HIV-1 due to drug resistance and persistent latency. Novel therapeutic intervention requires knowledge of intracellular pathways responsible for viral replication, specifically those untargeted by antiretroviral drugs. An understudied phenomenon is the nucleolar localization of Rev phosphoprotein, which completes nucleocytoplasmic transport of unspliced/partially spliced HIV mRNA through multimerization with intronic cis-acting targets—the Rev-response element (RRE). Rev contains a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) comprising the COOH terminus of the arginine-rich motif for accumulation within nucleoli—speculated as the interaction ground for Rev with cellular proteins mediating mRNA-independent nuclear export and splicing. Functionality of Rev nucleolar access during HIV-1 production and infection was investigated in the context of deletion and single-point mutations within Rev-NoLS. Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle. HIV-1(HXB2) replication ceased with Rev mutations lacking nucleolar access due to loss or replacement of multiple arginine residues. Rev mutations missing single arginine residues remained strictly nucleolar in pattern and participated in proviral production, however, with reduced efficiency. Viral RNA packaging also decreased in efficiency after expression of nucleolar-localizing mutations. These results were observed during propagation of variant HIV-1(NL4-3) containing nucleolar-localizing mutations within the viral backbone (M4, M5, and M6). Lentiviral particles produced with Rev single-point mutations were transducible at extremely low frequency. Similarly, HIV-1(NL4-3) Rev-NoLS variants lost infectivity, unlike virulent WT (wild type) HIV-1(NL4-3). HIV-1(NL4-3) variants were capable of CD4(+) host entry and reverse transcription as WT HIV-1(NL4-3), but lacked ability to complete a full infectious cycle. We currently reveal that viral integration is deregulated in the presence of Rev-NoLS mutations.",Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the HIV-1 infectious cycle.,"['Mutations', 'induced', 'upon', 'Rev-NoLS', 'are', 'hypothesized', 'to', 'inactivate', 'the_HIV-1_infectious_cycle', '.']",Mutations induced upon Rev-NoLS are hypothesized to inactivate the_HIV-1_infectious_cycle .,"['Mutations', 'Rev-NoLS']"
"Background & Aims Hartnup amino acid transporter B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is the major luminal sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter of small intestine and kidney proximal tubule. The expression of B0AT1 in kidney was recently shown to depend on its association with collectrin (Tmem27), a protein homologous to the membrane-anchoring domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. Methods Because collectrin is almost absent from small intestine, we tested the hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B0AT1 in enterocytes. Furthermore, because B0AT1 expression depends on an associated protein, we tested the hypothesis that Hartnup-causing B0AT1 mutations differentially impact on B0AT1 interaction with intestinal and kidney accessory proteins. Results Immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and functional experiments using wild-type and ace2-null mice showed that expression of B0AT1 in small intestine critically depends on ACE2. Coexpressing new and previously identified Hartnup disorder–causing missense mutations of B0AT1 with either collectrin or ACE2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the high-frequency D173N and the newly identified P265L mutant B0AT1 transporters can still be activated by ACE2 but not collectrin coexpression. In contrast, the human A69T and R240Q B0AT1 mutants cannot be activated by either of the associated proteins, although they function as wild-type B0AT1 when expressed alone. Conclusions We thus show that ACE2 is necessary for the expression of the Hartnup transporter in intestine and suggest that the differential functional association of mutant B0AT1 transporters with ACE2 and collectrin in intestine and kidney, respectively, participates in the phenotypic heterogeneity of human Hartnup disorder.","Because collectrin is almost absent from small intestine, we tested the hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B0AT1 in enterocytes.","['Because', 'collectrin', 'is', 'almost', 'absent', 'from', 'small_intestine', ',', 'we', 'tested', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'ACE2', 'that', 'interacts', 'with', 'B0AT1', 'in', 'enterocytes', '.']","Because collectrin is almost absent from small_intestine , we tested the_hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B0AT1 in enterocytes .","['collectrin', 'small_intestine', 'the_hypothesis', 'ACE2', 'B0AT1', 'enterocytes']"
"The maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses in African forest ecosystems are still unknown, but indirect evidences point at the involvement of some bat species. Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.","Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet.","['Despite', 'intense_research', ',', 'the_main_bat-maintenance_hypothesis', 'has', 'not', 'been', 'confirmed', 'yet', '.']","Despite intense_research , the_main_bat-maintenance_hypothesis has not been confirmed yet .","['intense_research', 'the_main_bat-maintenance_hypothesis']"
"BACKGROUND: In diabetes mellitus the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease is increased and represents an important independent mechanism by which heart disease is exacerbated. The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors, including PPARα, and to a lesser degree PPARβ and PPARγ1. How these transcription factors are regulated in the heart is largely unknown. Recent studies have described post-translational ubiquitination of PPARs as ways in which PPAR activity is inhibited in cancer. However, specific mechanisms in the heart have not previously been described. Recent studies have implicated the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase muscle ring finger-2 (MuRF2) in inhibiting the nuclear transcription factor SRF. Initial studies of MuRF2−/− hearts revealed enhanced PPAR activity, leading to the hypothesis that MuRF2 regulates PPAR activity by post-translational ubiquitination. METHODS: MuRF2−/− mice were challenged with a 26-week 60% fat diet designed to simulate obesity-mediated insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mice were followed by conscious echocardiography, blood glucose, tissue triglyceride, glycogen levels, immunoblot analysis of intracellular signaling, heart and skeletal muscle morphometrics, and PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ1-regulated mRNA expression. RESULTS: MuRF2 protein levels increase ~20% during the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy induced by high fat diet. Compared to littermate wildtype hearts, MuRF2−/− hearts exhibit an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy, characterized by an early onset systolic dysfunction, larger left ventricular mass, and higher heart weight. MuRF2−/− hearts had significantly increased PPARα- and PPARγ1-regulated gene expression by RT-qPCR, consistent with MuRF2’s regulation of these transcription factors in vivo. Mechanistically, MuRF2 mono-ubiquitinated PPARα and PPARγ1 in vitro, consistent with its non-degradatory role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, increasing MuRF2:PPARγ1 (>5:1) beyond physiological levels drove poly-ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PPARγ1 in vitro, indicating large MuRF2 increases may lead to PPAR degradation if found in other disease states. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in MuRF2 have been described to contribute to the severity of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present study suggests that the lack of MuRF2, as found in these patients, can result in an exaggerated diabetic cardiomyopathy. These studies also identify MuRF2 as the first ubiquitin ligase to regulate cardiac PPARα and PPARγ1 activities in vivo via post-translational modification without degradation.

"The lion Panthera leo is one of the world's most charismatic carnivores and is one of Africa's key predators. Here, we used a large dataset from 357 lions comprehending 1.13 megabases of sequence data and genotypes from 22 microsatellite loci to characterize its recent evolutionary history. Patterns of molecular genetic variation in multiple maternal (mtDNA), paternal (Y-chromosome), and biparental nuclear (nDNA) genetic markers were compared with patterns of sequence and subtype variation of the lion feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV(Ple)), a lentivirus analogous to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In spite of the ability of lions to disperse long distances, patterns of lion genetic diversity suggest substantial population subdivision (mtDNA Φ(ST) = 0.92; nDNA F (ST) = 0.18), and reduced gene flow, which, along with large differences in sero-prevalence of six distinct FIV(Ple) subtypes among lion populations, refute the hypothesis that African lions consist of a single panmictic population. Our results suggest that extant lion populations derive from several Pleistocene refugia in East and Southern Africa (∼324,000–169,000 years ago), which expanded during the Late Pleistocene (∼100,000 years ago) into Central and North Africa and into Asia. During the Pleistocene/Holocene transition (∼14,000–7,000 years), another expansion occurred from southern refugia northwards towards East Africa, causing population interbreeding.

"Abstract Neutralizing effects of antibodies targeting the C-terminal stalk (S2) subunit of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus have previously been reported, although its mechanism remained elusive. In this study, high titered mouse antisera against the N-terminal globular (S1) and S2 subunits of the S protein were generated and total immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from these antisera. The efficiency of these purified IgGs in virus neutralization and blocking of receptor binding were compared quantitatively using virus neutralization assay and a previously developed cell-based receptor binding assay, respectively. We demonstrated that anti-S1 IgG neutralizes the virus and binds to the membrane associated S protein more efficiently than anti-S2 IgG does. Moreover, both anti-S1 and anti-S2 IgGs were able to abolish the binding between S protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-S1 IgG showed a significantly higher blocking efficiency. The unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG towards the receptor binding implied a possible role of the S2 subunit in virus docking process and argues against the current hypothesis of viral entry. On the other hand, the functional roles of the previously reported neutralizing epitopes within S2 subunit were investigated using an antigen specific antibody depletion assay. Depletion of antibodies against these regions significantly diminished, though not completely abolished, the neutralizing effects of anti-S2 IgG. It suggests the absence of a major neutralizing domain on S2 protein. The possible ways of anti-S2 IgGs to abolish the receptor binding and the factors restricting anti-S2 IgGs to neutralize the virus are discussed.",The unexpected blocking ability of anti-S2 IgG towards the receptor binding implied a possible role of the S2 subunit in virus docking process and argues against the current hypothesis of viral entry.,"['The_unexpected_blocking_ability', 'of', 'anti-S2_IgG', 'towards', 'the', 'receptor', 'binding', 'implied', 'a_possible_role', 'of', 'the_S2_subunit', 'in', 'virus_docking_process', 'and', 'argues', 'against', 'the_current_hypothesis', 'of', 'viral_entry', '.']",The_unexpected_blocking_ability of anti-S2_IgG towards the receptor binding implied a_possible_role of the_S2_subunit in virus_docking_process and argues against the_current_hypothesis of viral_entry .,"['anti-S2_IgG', 'receptor', 'a_possible_role', 'the_S2_subunit', 'virus_docking_process', 'the_current_hypothesis', 'viral_entry']"
"The M glycoprotein from the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), contains information for localization to the cis-Golgi network in its first transmembrane domain. We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids. Because the site of sphingolipid synthesis overlaps the localization of IBV M, we asked whether perturbation of sphingolipids affected localization of IBV M. Short-term treatment with two inhibitors of sphingolipid synthesis had no effect on localization of IBV M or other Golgi markers. Thus, ongoing synthesis of these lipids was not required for proper localization. Surprisingly, a third inhibitor, d,l-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino- 1-propanol (PDMP), shifted the steady-state distribution of IBV M from the Golgi complex to the ER. This effect was rapid and reversible and was also observed for ERGIC-53 but not for Golgi stack proteins. At the concentration of PDMP used, conversion of ceramide into both glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin was inhibited. Pretreatment with upstream inhibitors partially reversed the effects of PDMP, suggesting that ceramide accumulation mediates the PDMP-induced alterations. Indeed, an increase in cellular ceramide was measured in PDMP-treated cells. We propose that IBV M is at least in part localized by retrieval mechanisms. Further, ceramide accumulation reveals this cycle by upsetting the balance of anterograde and retrograde traffic and/ or disrupting retention by altering bilayer dynamics.",We hypothesize that localization to the Golgi complex may depend in part on specific interactions between protein transmembrane domains and membrane lipids.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that_localization', 'to', 'the_Golgi_complex', 'may', 'depend', 'in', 'part', 'on', 'specific_interactions', 'between', 'protein_transmembrane_domains', 'and', 'membrane_lipids', '.']",We hypothesize that_localization to the_Golgi_complex may depend in part on specific_interactions between protein_transmembrane_domains and membrane_lipids .,"['the_Golgi_complex', 'part', 'specific_interactions', 'protein_transmembrane_domains', 'membrane_lipids']"

"Epidemiological data suggest the notion that in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an acquired autoimmune disease and the cause may be an environmental factor(s), probably infectious, in genetically susceptible individuals. Several cases of viral induced demyelinatimg encephalomyelitis in human beings and in experimental models as well as the presence of IgG oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate that the infectious factor may be viral. However, the absence of a specific virus identification in MS central nervous system may hardly support this notion. On the other hand, the partial response of patients with MS to immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapy support the evidence of an autoimmune etiology for MS. However, the autoimmune hypothesis shares the same criticism with the infectious one in that no autoantigen(s) specific to and causative for MS has ever been identified. Nevertheless, the absence of identifiable infectious agent, especially viral does not rule out its presence at a certain time – point and the concomitant long term triggering of an autoimmune cascade of events thereafter.

"Evolutionary processes have shaped the vertebrate immune system over time, but proximal mechanisms control the onset, duration, and intensity of immune responses. Based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis, it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system. However, few studies have examined the differences between wild animals in their natural environments, in which they are typically exposed to a wide array of potential pathogens, and their conspecifics living in captivity. Wild spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are regularly exposed to myriad pathogens, but there is little evidence of disease-induced mortality in wild hyena populations, suggesting that immune defenses are robust in this species. Here we assessed differences in immune defenses between wild spotted hyenas that inhabit their natural savanna environment and captive hyenas that inhabit a captive environment where pathogen control programs are implemented. Importantly, the captive population of spotted hyenas was derived directly from the wild population and has been in captivity for less than four generations. Our results show that wild hyenas have significantly higher serum antibody concentrations, including total IgG and IgM, natural antibodies, and autoantibodies than do captive hyenas; there was no difference in the bacterial killing capacity of sera collected from captive and wild hyenas. The striking differences in serum antibody concentrations observed here suggest that complementing traditional immunology studies, with comparative studies of wild animals in their natural environment may help to uncover links between environment and immune function, and facilitate progress towards answering immunological questions associated with the hygiene hypothesis.","Based on testing of the hygiene hypothesis, it is now well known that microbial exposure is important for proper development and regulation of the immune system.","['Based', 'on', 'testing', 'of', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', ',', 'it', 'is', 'now', 'well', 'known', 'that', 'microbial_exposure', 'is', 'important', 'for', 'proper_development', 'and', 'regulation', 'of', 'the_immune_system', '.']","Based on testing of the_hygiene_hypothesis , it is now well known that microbial_exposure is important for proper_development and regulation of the_immune_system .","['testing', 'the_hygiene_hypothesis', 'microbial_exposure', 'proper_development', 'regulation', 'the_immune_system']"
"Although interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) plays a critical role in the noncytolytic elimination of many neurotropic viral infections, the signaling response to this cytokine has not been extensively characterized in primary CNS neurons. We previously demonstrated that the IFN-γ response at the signaling and gene expression levels is temporally extended in primary mouse hippocampal neurons, as compared to the transient response of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). We hypothesize that the protracted kinetics of STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN-γ-treated neurons are due to extended receptor activation and/or delayed STAT1 dephosphorylation in the nucleus. Here, we show that in response to IFN-γ, the Janus kinases (JAK1/JAK2) associated with the neuronal IFN-γ receptor complex remain active for an extended period as compared to MEF. Experimental inactivation of JAK1/JAK2 in neurons after IFN-γ treatment did not reverse the extended STAT1 phosphorylation phenotype. These results suggest that the extended kinetics of neuronal IFN-γ signaling are a product of distinct negative feedback mechanisms operating at both the receptor and within the nucleus.",We hypothesize that the protracted kinetics of STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN-γ-treated neurons are due to extended receptor activation and/or delayed STAT1 dephosphorylation in the nucleus.,"['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'the_protracted_kinetics', 'of', 'STAT1_phosphorylation', 'in', 'IFN-γ-treated_neurons', 'are', 'due', 'to', 'extended_receptor_activation', 'and/or', 'delayed', 'STAT1_dephosphorylation', 'in', 'the_nucleus', '.']",We hypothesize that the_protracted_kinetics of STAT1_phosphorylation in IFN-γ-treated_neurons are due to extended_receptor_activation and/or delayed STAT1_dephosphorylation in the_nucleus .,"['the_protracted_kinetics', 'STAT1_phosphorylation', 'IFN-γ-treated_neurons', 'STAT1_dephosphorylation', 'the_nucleus']"
"BACKGROUND: The envelope glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can efficiently pseudotype lentiviral vectors. Some strains of LCMV exploit high affinity interactions with α-dystroglycan (α-DG) to bind to cell surfaces and subsequently fuse in low pH endosomes. LCMV strains with low α-DG affinity utilize an unknown receptor and display unique tissue tropisms. We pseudotyped non-primate feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vectors using LCMV derived glycoproteins with high or low affinity to α-DG and evaluated their properties in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We pseudotyped FIV with the LCMV WE54 strain envelope glycoprotein and also engineered a point mutation in the WE54 envelope glycoprotein (L260F) to diminish α-DG affinity and direct binding to alternate receptors. We hypothesized that this change would alter in vivo tissue tropism and enhance gene transfer to neonatal animals. RESULTS: In mice, hepatic α- and β-DG expression was greatest at the late gestational and neonatal time points. When displayed on the surface of the FIV lentivirus the WE54 L260F mutant glycoprotein bound weakly to immobilized α-DG. Additionally, LCMV WE54 pseudotyped FIV vector transduction was neutralized by pre-incubation with soluble α-DG, while the mutant glycoprotein pseudotyped vector was not. In vivo gene transfer in adult mice with either envelope yielded low transduction efficiencies in hepatocytes following intravenous delivery. In marked contrast, neonatal gene transfer with the LCMV envelopes, and notably with the FIV-L260F vector, conferred abundant liver and lower level cardiomyocyte transduction as detected by luciferase assays, bioluminescent imaging, and β-galactosidase staining. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a developmentally regulated receptor for LCMV is expressed abundantly in neonatal mice. LCMV pseudotyped vectors may have applications for neonatal gene transfer.

"The origin of viruses remains mysterious because of their diverse and patchy molecular and functional makeup. Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data. We take full advantage of the wealth of available protein structural and functional data to explore the evolution of the proteomic makeup of thousands of cells and viruses. Despite the extremely reduced nature of viral proteomes, we established an ancient origin of the “viral supergroup” and the existence of widespread episodes of horizontal transfer of genetic information. Viruses harboring different replicon types and infecting distantly related hosts shared many metabolic and informational protein structural domains of ancient origin that were also widespread in cellular proteomes. Phylogenomic analysis uncovered a universal tree of life and revealed that modern viruses reduced from multiple ancient cells that harbored segmented RNA genomes and coexisted with the ancestors of modern cells. The model for the origin and evolution of viruses and cells is backed by strong genomic and structural evidence and can be reconciled with existing models of viral evolution if one considers viruses to have originated from ancient cells and not from modern counterparts.","Although numerous hypotheses have attempted to explain viral origins, none is backed by substantive data.","['Although', 'numerous_hypotheses', 'have', 'attempted', 'to', 'explain', 'viral_origins', ',', 'none', 'is', 'backed', 'by', 'substantive_data', '.']","Although numerous_hypotheses have attempted to explain viral_origins , none is backed by substantive_data .","['numerous_hypotheses', 'viral_origins', 'none', 'substantive_data']"
"Abstract Viral pathogens have evolved a wide range of tactics to evade host immune responses and thus propagate effectively. One efficient tactic is to divert host immune responses toward an immunodominant decoy epitope and to induce non-neutralizing antibodies toward this epitope. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of decoy epitope in a subunit vaccine can affect the level of neutralizing antibody in an immunized animal. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by generating an antibody specific to the decoy epitope on the capsid protein of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2).

"Infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year. The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network. Public access to the VirHostNet knowledge-based system is available at http://pbildb1.univ-lyon1.fr/virhostnet.","Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery.","['Indeed', ',', 'modelling', 'of', 'an_infection_network', 'between', 'viral_and_cellular_proteins', 'will', 'provide', 'a_conceptual_and_analytic_framework', 'to', 'efficiently', 'formulate', 'new_biological_hypothesis', 'at', 'the_proteome_scale', 'and', 'to', 'rationalize', 'drug_discovery', '.']","Indeed , modelling of an_infection_network between viral_and_cellular_proteins will provide a_conceptual_and_analytic_framework to efficiently formulate new_biological_hypothesis at the_proteome_scale and to rationalize drug_discovery .","['modelling', 'an_infection_network', 'viral_and_cellular_proteins', 'a_conceptual_and_analytic_framework', 'new_biological_hypothesis', 'the_proteome_scale']"
"Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3) detects double-stranded (ds) RNAs to activate innate immune responses. While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs. TLR3 signaling was examined in a lung epithelial cell line by quantifying cytokine production and in human embryonic kidney cells by quantifying luciferase reporter levels. Recombinant 1b hepatitis C virus polymerase was found to enhance TLR3 signaling in the lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells when added to the media along with either poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. The polymerase from the genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV was a poor enhancer of TLR3 signaling until it was mutated to favor a conformation that could bind better to a partially duplexed RNA. The 1b polymerase also co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. RNA-binding capsid proteins (CPs) from two positive-strand RNA viruses and the hepadenavirus hepatitis B virus (HBV) were also potent enhancers of TLR3 signaling by poly(I:C) or viral dsRNAs. A truncated version of the HBV CP that lacked an arginine-rich RNA-binding domain was unable to enhance TLR3 signaling. These results demonstrate that several viral RNA-binding proteins can enhance the dsRNA-dependent innate immune response initiated by TLR3.","While poly(I:C) is an excellent agonist for TLR3 in several cell lines and in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, viral dsRNAs tend to be poor agonists, leading to the hypothesis that additional factor(s) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral dsRNAs.","['While', 'poly(I', ':', 'C', ')', 'is', 'an_excellent_agonist', 'for', 'TLR3', 'in', 'several_cell_lines', 'and', 'in', 'human_peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cells', ',', 'viral_dsRNAs', 'tend', 'to', 'be', 'poor_agonists', ',', 'leading', 'to', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'additional', 'factor(s', ')', 'are', 'likely', 'required', 'to', 'allow', 'TLR3', 'to', 'respond', 'to', 'viral_dsRNAs', '.']","While poly(I : C ) is an_excellent_agonist for TLR3 in several_cell_lines and in human_peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cells , viral_dsRNAs tend to be poor_agonists , leading to the_hypothesis that additional factor(s ) are likely required to allow TLR3 to respond to viral_dsRNAs .","['While poly(I', 'C', 'an_excellent_agonist', 'TLR3', 'several_cell_lines', 'human_peripheral_blood_mononuclear_cells', 'poor_agonists', 'the_hypothesis', 'factor(s', 'TLR3', 'viral_dsRNAs']"
"The exposure of wild carnivores to viral pathogens, with emphasis on parvovirus (CPV/FPLV), was assessed based on the molecular screening of tissue samples from 128 hunted or accidentally road-killed animals collected in Portugal from 2008 to 2011, including Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon, n = 99), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n = 19), stone marten (Martes foina, n = 3), common genet (Genetta genetta, n = 3) and Eurasian badger (Meles meles, n = 4). A high prevalence of parvovirus DNA (63%) was detected among all surveyed species, particularly in mongooses (58%) and red foxes (79%), along with the presence of CPV/FPLV circulating antibodies that were identified in 90% of a subset of parvovirus-DNA positive samples. Most specimens were extensively autolysed, restricting macro and microscopic investigations for lesion evaluation. Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR possibly correspond to viral DNA reminiscent from previous infections. The molecular characterization of viruses, based on the analysis of the complete or partial sequence of the vp2 gene, allowed typifying three viral strains of mongoose and four red fox’s as feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and one stone marten’s as newCPV-2b type. The genetic similarity found between the FPLV viruses from free-ranging and captive wild species originated in Portugal and publicly available comparable sequences, suggests a closer genetic relatedness among FPLV circulating in Portugal. Although the clinical and epidemiological significance of infection could not be established, this study evidences that exposure of sympatric wild carnivores to parvovirus is common and geographically widespread, potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species, such as the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and the critically endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus).","Whenever possible to examine, signs of active disease were not present, supporting the hypothesis that the parvovirus vp2 gene fragments detected by real-time PCR","['Whenever', 'possible', 'to', 'examine', ',', 'signs', 'of', 'active_disease', 'were', 'not', 'present', ',', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'the_parvovirus_vp2_gene', 'fragments', 'detected', 'by', 'real-time_PCR']","Whenever possible to examine , signs of active_disease were not present , supporting the_hypothesis that the_parvovirus_vp2_gene fragments detected by real-time_PCR","['signs', 'active_disease', 'the_hypothesis', 'fragments', 'real-time_PCR']"
"Genome-scale screens for intraviral and virus–host protein interactions and the analysis of literature-curated datasets are able to provide a novel, comprehensive perspective of viruses, and virus-infected cells. Until now, large-scale interaction screens were predominantly performed with the yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) system; however, alternative high-throughput technologies detecting binary protein interactions or protein complexes have been developed. Although many of the previous studies suffer from a rather poor validation of the results and few biological implications, these technologies potentially lead to a plethora of novel hypotheses.

"In order to recognize and combat a diverse array of pathogens the immune system has a large repertoire of T cells having unique T cell receptors (TCRs) with only a few clones specific for any given antigen. We discuss how the number of different possible TCRs encoded in the genome (the potential repertoire) and the number of different TCRs present in an individual (the realized repertoire) can be measured. One puzzle is that the potential repertoire greatly exceeds the realized diversity of naïve T cells within any individual. We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of “evolutionary sloppiness.” Another immunological puzzle is why mice and humans have similar repertoires even though humans have over 1000-fold more T cells. We discuss how the idea of the “protecton,” the smallest unit of protection, might explain this discrepancy and estimate the size of “protecton” based on available precursor frequencies data. We then consider T cell cross-reactivity – the ability of a T cell clone to respond to more than one epitope. We extend existing calculations to estimate the extent of expected cross-reactivity between the responses to different pathogens. Our results are consistent with two observations: a low probability of observing cross-reactivity between the immune responses to two randomly chosen pathogens; and the ensemble of memory cells being sufficiently diverse to generate cross-reactive responses to new pathogens.","We show that the existing hypotheses fail to explain why the immune system has the potential to generate far more diversity than is used in an individual, and propose an alternative hypothesis of “evolutionary sloppiness.”","['We', 'show', 'that', 'the_existing_hypotheses', 'fail', 'to', 'explain', 'why', 'the_immune_system', 'has', 'the_potential', 'to', 'generate', 'far_more_diversity', 'than', 'is', 'used', 'in', 'an_individual', ',', 'and', 'propose', 'an_alternative_hypothesis', 'of', '“', 'evolutionary_sloppiness', '.', '”']","We show that the_existing_hypotheses fail to explain why the_immune_system has the_potential to generate far_more_diversity than is used in an_individual , and propose an_alternative_hypothesis of “ evolutionary_sloppiness . ”","['the_existing_hypotheses', 'the_immune_system', 'the_potential', 'far_more_diversity', 'an_individual', 'an_alternative_hypothesis', 'evolutionary_sloppiness']"
"The microbiome influences adaptive immunity and molecular mimicry influences T cell reactivity. Here, we evaluated whether the sequence similarity of various antigens to the microbiota dampens or increases immunogenicity of T cell epitopes. Sets of epitopes and control sequences derived from 38 antigenic categories (infectious pathogens, allergens, autoantigens) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Their similarity to microbiome sequences was calculated using the BLOSUM62 matrix. We found that sequence similarity was associated with either dampened (tolerogenic; e.g. most allergens) or increased (inflammatory; e.g. Dengue and West Nile viruses) likelihood of a peptide being immunogenic as a function of epitope source category. Ten-fold cross-validation and validation using sets of manually curated epitopes and non-epitopes derived from allergens were used to confirm these initial observations. Furthermore, the genus from which the microbiome homologous sequences were derived influenced whether a tolerogenic versus inflammatory modulatory effect was observed, with Fusobacterium most associated with inflammatory influences and Bacteroides most associated with tolerogenic influences. We validated these effects using PBMCs stimulated with various sets of microbiome peptides. “Tolerogenic” microbiome peptides elicited IL-10 production, “inflammatory” peptides elicited mixed IL-10/IFNγ production, while microbiome epitopes homologous to self were completely unreactive for both cytokines. We also tested the sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes to specific microbiome sequences derived from households of cockroach allergic individuals and non-allergic controls. Microbiomes from cockroach allergic households were less likely to contain sequences homologous to previously defined cockroach allergens. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes. Taken together this study suggests that microbiome sequence similarity influences immune reactivity to homologous epitopes encoded by pathogens, allergens and auto-antigens.","These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes.","['These_results', 'are', 'compatible', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'microbiome_sequences', 'may', 'contribute', 'to', 'the_tolerization', 'of', 'T_cells', 'for', 'allergen_epitopes', ',', 'and', 'lack', 'of', 'these_sequences', 'might', 'conversely', 'be', 'associated', 'with', 'increased_likelihood', 'of', 'T_cell_reactivity', 'against', 'the_cockroach_epitopes', '.']","These_results are compatible with the_hypothesis that microbiome_sequences may contribute to the_tolerization of T_cells for allergen_epitopes , and lack of these_sequences might conversely be associated with increased_likelihood of T_cell_reactivity against the_cockroach_epitopes .","['These_results', 'the_hypothesis', 'microbiome_sequences', 'T_cells', 'allergen_epitopes', 'lack', 'these_sequences', 'increased_likelihood', 'T_cell_reactivity', 'the_cockroach_epitopes']"
"Regulation of proteolysis plays a critical role in a myriad of important cellular processes. The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.","We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.","['We', 'anticipate', 'that', 'iProt-Sub', 'will', 'be', 'a_powerful_tool', 'for', 'proteome-wide_prediction', 'of', 'protease-specific_substrates', 'and', 'their_cleavage_sites', ',', 'and', 'will', 'facilitate', 'hypothesis-driven_functional_interrogation', 'of', 'protease-specific_substrate_cleavage', 'and', 'proteolytic_events', '.']","We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a_powerful_tool for proteome-wide_prediction of protease-specific_substrates and their_cleavage_sites , and will facilitate hypothesis-driven_functional_interrogation of protease-specific_substrate_cleavage and proteolytic_events .","['iProt-Sub', 'a_powerful_tool', 'proteome-wide_prediction', 'protease-specific_substrates', 'their_cleavage_sites', 'hypothesis-driven_functional_interrogation', 'protease-specific_substrate_cleavage', 'proteolytic_events']"
"BACKGROUND: Increasing robustness via improvement of resistance to pathogens is a major selection objective in livestock breeding. As resistance traits are difficult or impossible to measure directly, potential indirect criteria are measures of immune traits (ITs). Our underlying hypothesis is that levels of ITs with no focus on specific pathogens define an individual's immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general. Since variation in ITs depends on genetic, environmental and probably epigenetic factors, our aim was to estimate the relative importance of genetics. In this report, we present a large genetic survey of innate and adaptive ITs in pig families bred in the same environment. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fifty four ITs were studied on 443 Large White pigs vaccinated against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and analyzed by combining a principal component analysis (PCA) and genetic parameter estimation. ITs include specific and non specific antibodies, seric inflammatory proteins, cell subsets by hemogram and flow cytometry, ex vivo production of cytokines (IFNα, TNFα, IL6, IL8, IL12, IFNγ, IL2, IL4, IL10), phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation. While six ITs had heritabilities that were weak or not significantly different from zero, 18 and 30 ITs had moderate (0.1<h2≤0.4) or high (h2>0.4) heritability values, respectively. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between ITs were weak except for a few traits that mostly include cell subsets. PCA revealed no cluster of innate or adaptive ITs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that variation in many innate and adaptive ITs is genetically controlled in swine, as already reported for a smaller number of traits by other laboratories. A limited redundancy of the traits was also observed confirming the high degree of complementarity between innate and adaptive ITs. Our data provide a genetic framework for choosing ITs to be included as selection criteria in multitrait selection programmes that aim to improve both production and health traits.",Our underlying hypothesis is that levels of ITs with no focus on specific pathogens define an individual's immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general.,"['Our_underlying_hypothesis', 'is', 'that_levels', 'of', 'ITs', 'with', 'no_focus', 'on', 'specific_pathogens', 'define', ""an_individual's_immunocompetence"", 'and', 'thus', 'predict', 'response', 'to', 'pathogens', 'in', 'general', '.']",Our_underlying_hypothesis is that_levels of ITs with no_focus on specific_pathogens define an_individual's_immunocompetence and thus predict response to pathogens in general .,"['Our_underlying_hypothesis', 'that_levels', 'ITs', 'no_focus', ""specific_pathogens define an_individual's_immunocompetence"", 'response', 'pathogens']"
"Respiratory infections are associated with wheezing illnesses in all ages and may also impact the development and severity of asthma. Respiratory tract infections caused by viruses, Chlamydophila or Mycoplasma have been hypothesized to have significant roles in the pathogenesis of asthma. Progress is being made toward establishing the mechanisms by which these agents can cause acute wheezing and impact the pathophysiology of asthma. Host factors probably contribute to the risk of asthma inception and exacerbation, and these contributions may also vary with respect to early- versus adult-onset disease.

"Viruses depend on their hosts at every stage of their life cycles and must therefore communicate with them via Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs). To investigate the mechanisms of communication by different viruses, we overlay reported pairwise human-virus PPIs on human signalling pathways. Of 671 pathways obtained from NCI and Reactome databases, 355 are potentially targeted by at least one virus. The majority of pathways are linked to more than one virus. We find evidence supporting the hypothesis that viruses often interact with different proteins depending on the targeted pathway. Pathway analysis indicates overrepresentation of some pathways targeted by viruses. The merged network of the most statistically significant pathways shows several centrally located proteins, which are also hub proteins. Generally, hub proteins are targeted more frequently by viruses. Numerous proteins in virus-targeted pathways are known drug targets, suggesting that these might be exploited as potential new approaches to treatments against multiple viruses.",We find evidence supporting the hypothesis that viruses often interact with different proteins depending on the targeted pathway.,"['We', 'find', 'evidence', 'supporting', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'viruses', 'often', 'interact', 'with', 'different_proteins', 'depending', 'on', 'the_targeted_pathway', '.']",We find evidence supporting the_hypothesis that viruses often interact with different_proteins depending on the_targeted_pathway .,"['evidence', 'the_hypothesis', 'viruses', 'different_proteins', 'the_targeted_pathway']"
"We previously described isolation of a potentially new mammalian reovirus, designated BYD1, which can cause clinical symptoms similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in guinea pigs and macaques, from throat swabs of one SARS patient of Beijing, in 2003. For this study, we determined the genome sequences of BYD1 and the S1 gene sequences of other five mammalian reovirus isolates (BLD, JP, and BYL were isolated from different SARS patients during the outbreak, 302I and 302II were isolated from fecal specimens of two children of Beijing in 1982) to allow molecular comparison with other previously reported mammalian reoviruses (MRVs). Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.","Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature.","['Comparative_analyses', 'of', 'the', 'BYD1', 'genome', 'with', 'those', 'of', 'three_prototype_mammalian_reovirus_strains', 'demonstrated', 'that', 'BYD1', 'is', 'a_novel_reassortant_virus', ',', 'with', 'its_S1_gene_segment', 'coming', 'from', 'a', 'previously', 'unidentified', 'serotype', '2', 'isolate', 'and', 'other_nine_segments', 'coming', 'from', 'ancestors', 'of', 'homologous_T1L', 'and', 'T3D', 'segments', ',', 'which', 'supports', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'mammalian_reovirus_gene', 'segments', 'reassort', 'in', 'nature', '.']","Comparative_analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three_prototype_mammalian_reovirus_strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a_novel_reassortant_virus , with its_S1_gene_segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other_nine_segments coming from ancestors of homologous_T1L and T3D segments , which supports the_hypothesis that mammalian_reovirus_gene segments reassort in nature .","['Comparative_analyses', 'BYD1', 'three_prototype_mammalian_reovirus_strains', 'BYD1', 'a_novel_reassortant_virus', 'its_S1_gene_segment', 'serotype', 'other_nine_segments', 'ancestors', 'homologous_T1L', 'T3D segments', 'the_hypothesis', 'mammalian_reovirus_gene segments', 'nature']"
"Abstract Animals that hunt and scavenge are often exposed to a broad array of pathogens. Theory predicts the immune systems of animals specialized for scavenging should have been molded by selective pressures associated with surviving microbial assaults from their food. Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are capable hunters that have recently descended from carrion feeding ancestors. Hyenas have been documented to survive anthrax and rabies infections, and outbreaks of several other viral diseases that decimated populations of sympatric carnivores. In light of the extreme disease resistance manifested by spotted hyenas, our objective was to identify tools available for studying immune function in spotted hyenas and use these tools to document the hyena antibody response to immunization. Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes. We used ELISA and Western blots to test isotype-specific anti-feline antibodies for specific cross-reaction to hyena Ig epitopes. Molecular weights of heavy (IgA, IgG, IgM) and light chains of hyena immunoglobulins were determined by protein electrophoresis, and as expected, they were found to be similar to feline immunoglobulins. In order to further validate the cross-reactivity of the anti-feline antibodies and document the hyena humoral response, eight spotted hyenas were immunized with dinitrophenol conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) and serum anti-DNP responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for one year. The full array of isotype-specific antibodies identified here will allow veterinarians and other researchers to thoroughly investigate the hyena antibody response, and can be used in future studies to test hypotheses about pathogen exposure and immune function in this species.","Domestic cats (Felis catus) are the closest phylogenetic relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically, and we hypothesized that anti-cat isotype-specific antibodies would cross react with hyena immunoglobulin epitopes.","['Domestic_cats', '(Felis_catus', ')', 'are', 'the_closest_phylogenetic_relatives', 'of', 'hyenas', 'that', 'have', 'been', 'studied', 'in', 'detail', 'immunologically', ',', 'and', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'anti-cat_isotype-specific_antibodies', 'would', 'cross', 'react', 'with', 'hyena_immunoglobulin_epitopes', '.']","Domestic_cats (Felis_catus ) are the_closest_phylogenetic_relatives of hyenas that have been studied in detail immunologically , and we hypothesized that anti-cat_isotype-specific_antibodies would cross react with hyena_immunoglobulin_epitopes .","['Domestic_cats', 'Felis_catus', 'hyenas', 'detail', 'anti-cat_isotype-specific_antibodies', 'hyena_immunoglobulin_epitopes']"
"Replication-competent controlled virus vectors were derived from the virulent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) wild-type strain 17syn+ by placing one or two replication-essential genes under the stringent control of a gene switch that is coactivated by heat and an antiprogestin. Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors—which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines—induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.",IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it.,"['IMPORTANCE', 'We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'vigorous_replication', 'of', 'a_pathogen', 'may', 'be', 'critical', 'for', 'eliciting', 'the_most_potent_and_balanced_immune_response', 'against', 'it', '.']",IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous_replication of a_pathogen may be critical for eliciting the_most_potent_and_balanced_immune_response against it .,"['IMPORTANCE', 'vigorous_replication', 'a_pathogen', 'the_most_potent_and_balanced_immune_response']"
"A scenario tree model was developed to propose efficient bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) control measures. The model used field data in eastern Hokkaido where the risk of BVDV infection in cattle has been reduced by an eradication program including mass vaccination, individual tests prior to communal pasture grazing, herd screening tests using bulk milk, and outbreak investigations of newly infected herds. These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation. In each simulation, the numbers of cattle infected persistently and transiently with BVDV detected by clinical manifestations and diagnosis tests and of missed by all of the diagnosis tests were calculated, and the numbers were used as indicators to be compared for the efficacy of the control measures. The model outputs indicated that the adoption of mass vaccination decreased the number of missed BVD cattle, although it did not increase the number of detected BVD cattle. Under implementation of mass vaccination, the efficacy of individual tests on selected 20% of the young and adult cattle was equal to that of the herd screening test performed in all the herds. When the virus prevalence or the number of sensitive animals becomes low, the efficacy of herd screening test was superior to one of individual tests. Considering the model outputs together, the scenario tree model developed in the present study was useful to compare the efficacy of the control measures for BVD.",These four activities were then used as hypothesized control measures in the simulation.,"['These_four_activities', 'were', 'then', 'used', 'as', 'hypothesized_control_measures', 'in', 'the_simulation', '.']",These_four_activities were then used as hypothesized_control_measures in the_simulation .,"['These_four_activities', 'hypothesized_control_measures', 'the_simulation']"
"Population fragmentation is a major problem for the conservation of mammalian species. Since the spread of an infectious disease is related to the intensity of contacts between individuals, fragmentation destabilizes the way the parasites circulate in their host population. Recently, Zinkernagel has proposed that a reduction in the frequency of infections by a parasite could lead to the emergence of severe forms of the disease, previously avoided because the disease was contracted early in life and attenuated by maternal antibodies. However, it is still unclear whether this change in disease expression increases the global mortality it induces because the disease becomes more severe and also less frequent. Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel. Firstly, we show that there is a change in the severity of the disease during the fragmentation process, especially at a local scale, suggesting that host population fragmentation could be a widespread mechanism of disease emergence. Secondly, we show that the emergence of the severe form of the disease can lead to a significant increase in its induced mortality. Finally, we determine the types of interactions for which the fragmentation of the host population could be the most dangerous.","Here, we use a mathematical model to link population fragmentation with the hypothesis of Zinkernagel.","['Here', ',', 'we', 'use', 'a_mathematical_model', 'to', 'link', 'population_fragmentation', 'with', 'the_hypothesis', 'of', 'Zinkernagel', '.']","Here , we use a_mathematical_model to link population_fragmentation with the_hypothesis of Zinkernagel .","['a_mathematical_model', 'population_fragmentation', 'the_hypothesis', 'Zinkernagel']"
"As the predominant aetiological agent of the common cold, human rhinovirus (HRV) is the leading cause of human infectious disease. Early studies showed that a monovalent formalin-inactivated HRV vaccine can be protective, and virus-neutralizing antibodies (nAb) correlated with protection. However, co-circulation of many HRV types discouraged further vaccine efforts. Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine may result in broad nAb responses. We show that serum nAb against many rhinovirus types can be induced by polyvalent, inactivated HRVs plus alhydrogel (alum) adjuvant. Using formulations up to 25-valent in mice and 50-valent in rhesus macaques, HRV vaccine immunogenicity was related to sufficient quantity of input antigens, and valency was not a major factor for potency or breadth of the response. Thus, we have generated a vaccine capable of inducing nAb responses to numerous and diverse HRV types.","Here, we test the hypothesis that increasing virus input titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine may result in broad nAb responses.","['Here', ',', 'we', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that', 'increasing_virus_input_titres', 'in', 'polyvalent', 'inactivated', 'HRV_vaccine', 'may', 'result', 'in', 'broad_nAb_responses', '.']","Here , we test the_hypothesis that increasing_virus_input_titres in polyvalent inactivated HRV_vaccine may result in broad_nAb_responses .","['the_hypothesis', 'polyvalent', 'inactivated HRV_vaccine', 'broad_nAb_responses']"
"BACKGROUND: Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a widely distributed pathogen, causing disease and economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to naïve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. METHODS: A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four naïve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two naïve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. RESULTS: The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.

"BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is endemic to the entire south-east Asian and adjoining regions. Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.","We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'Vivo-Morpholinos', 'generated', 'against', 'specific_regions', 'of', '3′_or_5′_untranslated_regions', 'of', 'JEV', 'genome', ',', 'when', 'administered', 'in', 'an_experimental_model', 'of', 'JE', ',', 'will', 'have', 'significant_antiviral_and_neuroprotective_effect', '.']","We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific_regions of 3′_or_5′_untranslated_regions of JEV genome , when administered in an_experimental_model of JE , will have significant_antiviral_and_neuroprotective_effect .","['Vivo-Morpholinos', 'specific_regions', '3′_or_5′_untranslated_regions', 'JEV', 'an_experimental_model', 'JE']"
"Abstract P/V gene substitutions convert the non-cytopathic paramyxovirus Simian Virus 5 (SV5), which is a poor inducer of host cell responses in human tissue culture cells, into a mutant (P/V-CPI−) that induces high levels of apoptosis, interferon (IFN)-beta, and proinflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of SV5-P/V gene mutations on virus growth and adaptive immune responses in animals has not been determined. Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses. In mouse cells, in vitro studies identified a panel of SV5-P/V mutants that ranged in their ability to limit IFN responses. Intranasal infection of mice with these WT and P/V mutant viruses elicited equivalent anti-SV5 IgG responses at all doses tested, and viral titers recovered from the respiratory tract were indistinguishable. In primary cultures of ferret lung fibroblasts, WT rSV5 and P/V-CPI− viruses had phenotypes similar to those established in human cell lines, including differential induction of IFN secretion, IFN signaling and apoptosis. Intranasal infection of ferrets with a low dose of WT rSV5 elicited ~500 fold higher anti-SV5 serum IgG responses compared to the P/V-CPI− mutant, and this correlated with overall higher viral titers for the WT virus in tracheal tissues. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody response to infection of ferrets with P/V-CPI−, but not with WT rSV5. Together our data indicate that WT rSV5 and P/V mutants can elicit distinct innate and adaptive immunity phenotypes in the ferret animal model system, but not in the mouse system. We present a model for the effect of P/V gene substitutions on SV5 growth and immune responses in vivo.","Here, we used two distinct animal model systems to test the hypothesis that SV5-P/V mutants which are more potent activators of innate responses in tissue culture will also elicit higher antiviral antibody responses.","['Here', ',', 'we', 'used', 'two_distinct_animal_model_systems', 'to', 'test', 'the_hypothesis', 'that_SV5-P/V_mutants', 'which', 'are', 'more_potent_activators', 'of', 'innate_responses', 'in', 'tissue_culture', 'will', 'also', 'elicit', 'higher_antiviral_antibody_responses', '.']","Here , we used two_distinct_animal_model_systems to test the_hypothesis that_SV5-P/V_mutants which are more_potent_activators of innate_responses in tissue_culture will also elicit higher_antiviral_antibody_responses .","['two_distinct_animal_model_systems', 'the_hypothesis that_SV5-P/V_mutants', 'more_potent_activators', 'innate_responses', 'tissue_culture']"
"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is characterized by macrophage and neutrophil leukocyte recruitment and activation in the liver. Damage‐ and pathogen‐associated molecular patterns contribute to a self‐perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM‐1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll‐like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand‐independent TREM‐1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high‐density lipoprotein (HDL)‐mimicking complexes GF9‐HDL and GA/E31‐HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5‐week alcohol feeding with the Lieber‐DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM‐1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol‐fed mice, and TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM‐1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol‐induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM‐1 signaling. The TREM‐1 inhibitors significantly inhibited macrophage (epidermal growth factor‐like module‐containing mucin‐like hormone receptor‐like 1 [F4/80], clusters of differentiation [CD]68) and neutrophil (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus G [Ly6G] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) markers and proinflammatory cytokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP‐1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF‐α], interleukin‐1β [IL‐1β], macrophage inflammatory protein 1α [MIP‐1α]) at the mRNA level compared to the HDL vehicle. Administration of TREM‐1 inhibitors ameliorated liver steatosis and early fibrosis markers (α‐smooth muscle actin [αSMA] and procollagen1α [Pro‐Col1α]) at the mRNA level in alcohol‐fed mice. However, the HDL vehicle also reduced serum ALT and some cytokine protein levels in alcohol‐fed mice, indicating HDL‐related effects. Conclusion: HDL‐delivered novel TREM‐1 peptide inhibitors ameliorate early phases of inflammation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and activation in the liver and attenuate hepatocyte damage and liver steatosis. TREM‐1 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for further investigations in ALD.",We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD.,"['We', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'TREM‐1', 'signaling', 'contributes', 'to', 'proinflammatory', 'pathway_activation', 'in', 'ALD', '.']",We hypothesized that TREM‐1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway_activation in ALD .,"['contributes', 'pathway_activation', 'ALD']"
"The unique ornamental features and extreme sexual traits of Peacock have always intrigued scientists and naturalists for centuries. However, the genomic basis of these phenotypes are yet unknown. Here, we report the first genome sequence and comparative analysis of peacock with the high quality genomes of chicken, turkey, duck, flycatcher and zebra finch. Genes involved in early developmental pathways including TGF-β, BMP, and Wnt signaling, which have been shown to be involved in feather patterning, bone morphogenesis, and skeletal muscle development, revealed signs of adaptive evolution and provided useful clues on the phenotypes of peacock. Innate and adaptive immune genes involved in complement system and T-cell response also showed signs of adaptive evolution in peacock suggesting their possible role in building a robust immune system which is consistent with the predictions of the Hamilton–Zuk hypothesis.

"In the recent years, it has been demonstrated that the biological activity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is mediated through the release of paracrine factors. Many of these factors are released into exosomes, which are small membranous vesicles that participate in cell–cell communication. Exosomes from MSCs are thought to have similar functions to MSCs such as repairing and regeneration of damaged tissue, but little is known about the immunomodulatory effect of these vesicles. Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets. According to this hypothesis, in vitro experiments were performed to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of human adipose MSCs derived exosomes (exo-hASCs) on in vitro stimulated T cells. The phenotypic characterization of cytotoxic and helper T cells (activation and differentiation markers) together with functional assays (proliferation and IFN-γ production) demonstrated that exo-hASCs exerted an inhibitory effect in the differentiation and activation of T cells as well as a reduced T cell proliferation and IFN-γ release on in vitro stimulated cells. In summary, here we demonstrate that MSCs-derived exosomes are a cell-derived product that could be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases.","Based on an extensive bibliography where the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated, here we hypothesized that released exosomes from MSCs may have an immunomodulatory role on the differentiation, activation and function of different lymphocyte subsets.","['Based', 'on', 'an_extensive_bibliography', 'where', 'the_immunomodulatory_capacity', 'of', 'MSCs', 'has', 'been', 'demonstrated', ',', 'here', 'we', 'hypothesized', 'that', 'released_exosomes', 'from', 'MSCs', 'may', 'have', 'an_immunomodulatory_role', 'on', 'the_differentiation', ',', 'activation', 'and', 'function', 'of', 'different_lymphocyte_subsets', '.']","Based on an_extensive_bibliography where the_immunomodulatory_capacity of MSCs has been demonstrated , here we hypothesized that released_exosomes from MSCs may have an_immunomodulatory_role on the_differentiation , activation and function of different_lymphocyte_subsets .","['an_extensive_bibliography', 'the_immunomodulatory_capacity', 'MSCs', 'released_exosomes', 'MSCs', 'an_immunomodulatory_role', 'the_differentiation', 'activation', 'function', 'different_lymphocyte_subsets']"
"We provide experimental evidence of a replication enhancer element (REE) within the capsid gene of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, genus Flavivirus). Thermodynamic and phylogenetic analyses predicted that the REE folds as a long stable stem–loop (designated SL6), conserved among all tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV). Homologous sequences and potential base pairing were found in the corresponding regions of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, but not in more genetically distant flaviviruses. To investigate the role of SL6, nucleotide substitutions were introduced which changed a conserved hexanucleotide motif, the conformation of the terminal loop and the base-paired dsRNA stacking. Substitutions were made within a TBEV reverse genetic system and recovered mutants were compared for plaque morphology, single-step replication kinetics and cytopathic effect. The greatest phenotypic changes were observed in mutants with a destabilized stem. Point mutations in the conserved hexanucleotide motif of the terminal loop caused moderate virus attenuation. However, all mutants eventually reached the titre of wild-type virus late post-infection. Thus, although not essential for growth in tissue culture, the SL6 REE acts to up-regulate virus replication. We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","We hypothesize that this modulatory role may be important for TBEV survival in nature, where the virus circulates by non-viraemic transmission between infected and non-infected ticks, during co-feeding on local rodents.","['We', 'hypothesize', 'that', 'this_modulatory_role', 'may', 'be', 'important', 'for', 'TBEV_survival', 'in', 'nature', ',', 'where', 'the_virus', 'circulates', 'by', 'non-viraemic_transmission', 'between', 'infected_and_non-infected_ticks', ',', 'during', 'co-feeding', 'on', 'local_rodents', '.']","We hypothesize that this_modulatory_role may be important for TBEV_survival in nature , where the_virus circulates by non-viraemic_transmission between infected_and_non-infected_ticks , during co-feeding on local_rodents .","['TBEV_survival', 'nature', 'the_virus', 'circulates', 'infected_and_non-infected_ticks', 'local_rodents']"
